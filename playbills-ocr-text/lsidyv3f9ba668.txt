A curious fcene was difccverable on Wednef-day evening at Drury-Lane Qratcr.a. A certain fstriatic Peer feemed to have been too late in at-
tending an appointment with his theatrical divinity, who long waited with an appearance of reliefs folicitude in the box, with cmly the formal dulnefs of maternal l’ociety to coafoie her. At laft, however, the dapper adorer arrived ; but nis reception was marked by a moil mortifyiog coolnefs; and thcThefpiatt GodJt/s joon turned away in pouting indignation. Various and innumerable were the efforts to foften the refentful fair, who remained inflexible to all tender entreaty ; nor could even parental interference at all mitigate the ftrong vindiflive feniiment that appeared to tubful in her bofom. The truth of the old maxim, t.iat ‘‘ the falling out of lovers is the renewal of love,” was, however, in the end fully confirmed, though many lpeflators were highly delighted in obferving the intcreiling events which ■ffiSlked the tronrejs nf rer,.„rUf.<,.^	/Kc*- et rf,ay

Whatever may be thought of Murphy's tragedies, his comic scenes certainly deserve more praise than blame.
Ail in the Wrong, besides other desirable qualities, has that, which after all every writer must covet, the praise of tendency. Beyond the mere merriment of the moment, a purpose as well meant, and as well attained, of mending life in a department that is material, and protediting love from the inroads of jealousy.
The four leading characters in this pleasant drama, (really as pleasant as Meliere and Murphy tan make it) all are to this effedt—an effect, which prospered even beyond expeitation, in the efforts of the four leading performers.
King far outdid himself—he was extremely comic always, and very seldom, scarcely ever, ctheiwisc than chaste.
Mrs. Siddons, the chief novelty of the evening, made the evening turn out, as the World foretold. Her Lady Restless, is not a jot less triumphant than her Isabella ! So that combining her Lady Restless with Kemble's Severity, inferior only from the inferiority of the part, and speaking of them together, this is our report--
That their truth in tragedy cannot be more feit, than their pre-eminence in comic ailing /
But that this pre-eminence exists alone, where there is matter to work upon.—Where there is sense for sense, • and emotion for emotion. Where the mind is aftive, and the heart not still, Bellum, Pax Rarsum. Where the vi-cissiludes are strong, the discriminations, subtle.
Where these are, there also should be the comic afting, the best of all possible comic ailing, of Kemble and Mrs. Siddons.
Miss Farren is the contrary of all this;__as
t ■ B/ittmnia and the Royal Sovereign cannot move but in deep water, she runs in any where, no matter how shallow.—Her’s is the astonishing power* of miking much out of little, and some-01not‘1*ng at all. Torre passing his »eel filings for gold dust is nobody to her.-_

, To counterbalance the outrage on Jephson’s Muse from the needless protrusion of his Ballad "Farce, which Tie wrote in three nights, and positively purposed to be ailed but one night—the benefit of 7endued.—To counterbalance this, the DruryJane Management was kind and politic in the*revival of Narbonne—which., is a Work of genius in itself, and the occasion of genius in others, ^	i .	•	.	_
"Wfien Kemble and Mrs. Siddons played this Tragedy so.me time ago, it was thought to be among their best successes.	•
But on Saturday it wasjiot so.—For on Saturday Narbonne was not. ’	i
The Play ivas changed, on the illness of Mrs. Crouch—w!u> .never slacks, but when thus tui-jableto perform.- .... j
t>ouglas was the substitute.	' °	1
A change like this,"of exertion so great, and on preparation so small, is a proof,of-temper and talents, at once splendid and endearing !
1 That any aftress could Jo it—that such an actress as Mrs. Sid dons would do it—equally merit commemoration.
The Lady Randolph failed in none of her usual great effeits.—The fashion of the House may he decided from such names as Sir Charles and Lady Dorothy being above stairs.—The feeling of the performance, from the tumultuous sorrows' of stage-box beauty, and an hysterica passio in the gallery.
* Bannister has so-much fame, that he can afford perhaps to lose a little—but it may be called an unnecessary waste of it to put him in Douglas. The part should be given to Kemble.
Paimer was no less sbevry than usual in Glenal-■von.—•Bemley and Aickin, each as far as his character could carry him, came forward for the praise of diligence and energy. All that Anna has to say, and more, perhaps, than she need look, were to be found in M s. Ward.
The Play, often beautifully written, and sometimes passionately felt, might be much mended with little alteration.—The" Play should close with the exit of the Lady.—What follows is unnecessary dullness. The suicide is a needless sin against morals.
1 he Sultan is but sorry company. However, the friends of Mrs. Jordan need not be sorry for her—as she got a great deal of applause.

MRS. JORDAN’S BENEFIT.
Long and frequent had been the admiration ver this Afiress in the juvenile vivacities of Co-edy—but it remained for last night—speaking (critically—to establish her in the more elevated alks of the sportive Muse.	_
This triumph she atchieved last night:—for her manner—her tones—her discriminations were exquisite.	.
Amongst the more luminous parts were her reading the verses—her stile in giving^ the word Rosalind—her Father’s marks—and ‘‘Which you have not ”—and indeed every part in the Boy’s cloaths—in which she looked to advantage.
Her dress in the bonnet was not well, and should not be repeated.
Kemlle'% Orlando was very excellent, particularly with Jaques; and Palmer and Suett lost no claim to praise.
The apology for King was not taken in good part by the audience, who love his presence.
The audience were what Mrs. 'Jordan should ever have—splendid, numerous and tasteful ; and in the way of benefit, five rows laid into the pit, and a house filled every where, cannot but be sa-tisfa&ory. Lady Dungannon, Lady Lumm, Mrs. Sheridan, Mrs. Hesse, and others, were amongst the fashionable attendants of the Theatre last night, and very distinguished in distin cutshing what was meritorious,

After a delay of two seasons, which like other ■delays we presumo to be official.—On Saturday night came forth Captain Jephton’s tragedy of JULIA.
The characters of which were thus given

Fulvia, -	-	- Mrs. WARD.

Kerin a,	-	- Miss TIDSWELL.
The Scene Genoa.
The brief story of this tragedy is as follows. Julia, the daughter of Durazzo, was to have been married to Claudio, who, previous to the opening of the play, is found unexpectedly murdered. The murderer unknown.
The play opens with the return of Manoa, a proscribed and broken merchant, to his own country, who finds prote&ion during the course of the play in the charity of Durazzo. Mente-•voli the late friend of the murdered Claudio— deeply enamoured of Julia—presses his suit to the father—whose countenance of that address he receives. Every scene displays the force of Minteyold passion through the s£ts of gentle supplication—strong jealousy and impatience of nvalship or restraint.
Julia still constant to her lost lover, returns not his passion. He grows desperate—he defies Marcellas, the brother of the late Claudio ro single combat—which is alone prevented at that time by Julia’s intercession—but taking place on the return of his resentment, Marcelius disarms and leaves him.
. ^;S desperation encreases :—he plans a meei mg with Julia whom he is about to force t marry him—in the struggle she seizes his dagg, and thus frees herself from his intended viol, tion of her heart.
In the distress of .his mind, Mentevoli drops ptttae of Juha which he had carried about hii
ran-;00'! tune; oiJmP‘a> his sister, finds ar arries ,t to the dressing room of Julia, in tl
tlw i may pr.0ve a.silent argument of her brc nf	4* 51** moment Fulvia the motln

¡through an Italian mind, is wonderfully"drawn in the character of Mentevoli:—The strong portraiture of the Jew by Shakespeare does not exceed it.
Through every part the writing does credit to the genius of Jephson : the language is bold and nervous, the allusions in general well chosen, and the ideas in perfect unison with the person who gives them utterance. As a story of natural passion and domestic woe, it goes very forcibly to the heart.
Unabating constancy in a mind of worth and dignity, alone distinguish the part of Julia, but they distinguish it well and with effeit.
We have not a doubt, therefore, but this play, when the first and second a£t, and perhaps the third are abridged, will have long and merited success with the town.
Of the performance, our report may not be so gallant as we could wish it—for on tins occasion the Brother must go before the Sister.
The Mentevoli of Kemble—in agitation of mind—in every expressive gesture—in all his looks—in tone and perfet conception of the character, stood last night as a work more to be wondered at, than any thing we have seen since the days of Garrick. It was a chef d’ceuvre in ailing, and will be a lesson to him—how profitably he has thrown aside that precision and studied solemnity which once impeded his road to Fame.'	*
In the first part of the play, the Siddons found not scope for her great abilities ; but whenever any energy—any thing of strong and contemptuous manner—and marked expression brought her forth, she was there again ail herself.
Of the seledtable parts was her scene with Montevoli in the garden, and when »he seized his dagger—and still more that quiet despair with which she marked the firmness of her affection to the lost Claudio:—Her countenance there was above all speech.
Fainter was well every where : when he had much to do—he shewed he could do more. His scene with MentvvoL was excellent. Mrs. IPard was the mother, and we trust makes an excellent one—beyond ailing.	Mrs. Bremen had too
much of a whine for her own ‘tredit.
Betuley and Aicxtn were both respetable and lost nothing of makiug better what was written for them.
The Prologue was from the Pen of Malone and contained many elegant aid animited line:.«

THE PLAY-HOUSE.
DRU R Y-L ANE.
Of erroneous matter, there was noticeable but one particular-—It was this—in the first aft,
“ He brings gr eat news,”
Lady Macbeth.
Though Wdkes may hot be the best praftical commentator in the world on the whole ot the
decalogue_Yet on the sixth commandment his
word may be taken—On the 7th and 8th, we may talk hereafter.
For he very well said, when tire House of Commons heard him, on the 6th commandment; “ the tragedy of Macbeth, is of dissua" sives from murder, the most acceptable and •• the best”	_	_
He that can sit these scenes, insensible to the sublimity of the Bard, and the purifying purposes of the Moralist, can have in dullness only, his refuge from imputed obduracy !
How are these scenes, exalting as they are, yet more exalted by thegrestt aSresses art !—And how compleat would be the charm, was the Mscleth such as he ought to be (
To correft is painful; very painful, even where the objeft is corrigible —But however painful, duty must be done.—In spite of old services, and gentlemanlike good fame, Smith must allow us to tell him, his Macbeth fails altogether.—There is scarce a line of it given tolerably. All the fine involution, the subtle discriminations of the part, are looked for in vain. There are none of the splendid vicissitudes, in feeling that is quick, and expression that is strong. From “ the initiate fear,” to his conclusion in remorse, who can truly say, he felt any excitement, either of terror or of pity ? In short we must say to Smith, very irksome if is, in his Macbeth nothing can become him—ike his resigning it.
r he Lady Macbeth, brief as her candle is, had more light and heat than ever 1-—-.The whole character was conceived and executed in the grandest possibilities of the art !—Some strokes °. novelty ana new force were apparent in these s. ort passages—In the shew of scorn on “ the oncers,”—Her disgust at his admired dis-1 er, protrafted through the tone in which she answers Macbeth’s question as to time—'• Almost at odds with morning, &c.”
' e stTong conveyance of the murderous ex-tW entln	w°rds—“ O never shall the sun
se.e’”—the early inroad of c„i,Japprobation an^ remorse, when she eja-“ Nought’s got—All’s spent, &c.” DlauH;,. ani AmP!ius, there were four special which0I?Mbe c1j?se 0<r her last little scene, int Jnj Pbli.os°phical an-angement, deep feel-
^^¿mSeaftine?iShinS’ "T* ^ 3
Were direfted to the messenger.—They should be, as a rapture to herself.
Smith had similar offence, when he says to the messenger, instead of to himself.
“ I care no; if thou do’st for me as mueh?"
He sported also a new reading—which, but in sport, we beg to hear no more—videlicet.
There would have been a time, for such a word
To-morrow !—and to-morrow, aed to-morrow, &c.
So punftuated the first line running into the second:
Better than this, and as much laughed at, was his impromptu on an accidental fall of Mac-dujf Hi the fight, &c.	'
......	.....Lay on Macduff——
And damn’d be he that first—oit vr—and figUt enough.
An impromptu this not unworthy of Foote.
Aickin’s good sense and decorum, made no indecent sacrifices to the laughter of barren spectators, and so was the best Witch we ever had.
Whitfield got a plaudit in the fourth aft. Mrs.
Crouch warbled and dimpled it away most beautifully ;—as in thankful glee to Mrs. Crespigny and. Co. for her full benefit the night before, she could not have a fuller benefit than she deserved.
Present Lady St. John, Fortescue, Langham, Greathead—The Watt’s—Erskines, &c. Scc.
And as was said, the Duchess of Devonshire.
Mrs. Jordan’s property can never cease, when she can prosper on such sorry stuff as the Sultan.
JDsti ry-Lane.
. ......-
KELLY-—the rtexu Singer. '
For thus must we begin our account when we look to'the School for Fathers, as a revival—with no one power to create a wish or satisfy it—except it were to bring forth to view a new Singer
This Singer has, what many of his brethren have not, a good person and aftion, perfectly unembarassed—but then he is of a country not easily put out of countenance—which accounts for it.	.	r
His voice is powerful, clear and harmonious, and his knowledge in music distinguishable. But he is of the Italian schpol; and must e’er he pleases an English audience,' learn to articu-\late. In this he is wonderfully deficient ; more iso than any singer we;recoileft. This must be conquered.
Qf'the remaining part of the drama—Mrs. Crouch looked charmingly; and beter still, Parsons afted so; his scene of grimace absolute on the preparation for pursuing his daughter, was in as fine afting as any thing we ever saw—even from him.
Dodd's Jessamy, was well—but it was of the last century—traits of antient genius not,belonging to the levity of this day’s coxcomb.
The house was thinly scattered—but, not with the friends of Kelly, who were superabundant in their gratulations of him. The joy of the Jews fever Mendoza after the boxing match wa,s nothin <r to it.

Drury-Lane.
The interest, through the play of Douglas, rrss progressive and ascending ; to match it, had been difficult. It had been a model, not only of dramatic diction, but of pathetic impression also.
This impression, in the second and third a£ls, is supreme.
None of this Impression failed on the last performance of Mrs. Siddons, and some of it succeeded more than usual. Particularly in these short, but important passages.
k O God of heaven !—Did lie than die so lately !” When speaking of the gems,
* Thy father’s, sayst th»u f-rAb 1 they were thy father's.'’
And in the concluding scene, her exclamations over*her son—
My son!—my son t—my beautiful—my brave—
^One obvious amendment offers, in the close cf this play. The curtain should fall, on the final exit of Lady Randolph. All that follows is merely expletive.—Old Norval, Anna, and Lord Randolph, do their best; but their creative power is not unlimited. An eileft cannot come without a cause. Segnius irritant animus.—Nothing is said by either of the persons that is very good : and something is done, which is much the opposite, of good. We refer to the needless guilt, in the suicide of the lady, and in the unavailing desperation of the lord.
Palmer’s Glenalvon is among "His best performances. Much of it, is very well aaed. And all of it is singularly well, in appearance and deportment.
The audience looked, as if Mrs. Siddons, bad not ailed in the last thirteen days, eight times!

On the illness of the Siddons, unable to go through such a part as Isabella, the play wts changed into the Winter’s Tale, and with it— much of the audience. The play was- succeeded by a new farce, called
The Distress'd Baronets
The story and, characters of which being confused, by occasional disapprobations of the audience—perhaps too rigid—and it ending in much clamour, it would not prove theatric justice to the author, to attempt, in such a state, to venture to detail hiv plot.
It was given out, after an unaccountable delay from Mr- Palmer, for the next night after the benefits-.
The prologue was admirably delivered by the best prologue speaker of the day—the younger Bannister.

In this account, there will be no complaint of prolixity—all that need be said, of Love in a Village, the prettiness in some of the songs, the infantine fatuity in all the dialogue, may thus be dispatched in these few words :
Aitkin and Parsons gave the goad acting of the night.—Bannister and Mrs. Crouch sung very well.
Kelly, we are sorry to say, cannot have our voice unexceptionably, till he has more of his own. He has however great promise, in our prédirions, of future fame in his favor.
The New Farce, The Distress’d Baronet, was in distress no longer.—There was much applause, and nothing else :—except on one short sentence,—and there surely, the disapprobation, small as it was, must be unmerited—for the words were these, the pawnbroker’s utterance— “ Oh ! my Lord always redeems his property, in my hands, after the meeting of Parliament.” Temporizing with the prejudices 01 the profession, has had a wonderful effefl in the bias of the Drama—an honest attorney is a rara avis—but the transmutation—proves salvation to the piece.

The event of Monday night shews what won-, ders are to be done by chara&er !—
In spite of the play, which, except in the two Shores, is at the best but bad ; if not repulsive, generally weak,—the house was crowded ! —As it should be in every cause of taste, literature, and morals, the shew was abundant, both of talents and title.
Erskine, Jerningham, Madame Piozzi, Tic-kell — the Dutchess of Devonshire, Dutchess of Gordon, Lady Wallace—the Harcourts, St. Johns, Palmerstons, Moores, Markhams, Gunnings, Lady Mexborough — Sir Watkin, Lord Derby—All were there.
The Duke of Roxborough was with Sir Charles aqd Lady Dorothy — And we did not see, but we heard, of Madame Polignac.
And if so—we are glad of it—for the first impression of our stage, will in the instance of Alicia, be a very grand one.
Alicia was indeed every thing it could be, from first to last — from fair effusion of kind purpose—thro’ love alarmed—sudden jealousy —momentajy simulation — to open rage—and frantic desperation.
Small faults there were—but little more than organic merely. — Twice the voice did not its office, upon single words. — But in all the leading efforts of the charafler, imagination and utterance kept perfeft pace together : — and together went, to full perfection.
This, as every other objeft, will be felt differently, by different people—nay, by mere difference of place, differently too, where the people are the same. Thus, while we read the play in a private book room, it must be owned with Johnson, Alicia comes to the sense, like empty noise—but at the theatre, when aided by such fine art as the ailing of Mrs. Siddons, there is some of the interest Warton talks of, and the madness affeils like nature.—It is no extravagance to say, the delusion of the cracking roof, operated like reality, and for the moment, made the mind totter under what impended.
Your Atomical Critic won’t be satisfied without the microscopic eye has been at work. Here he may find such independent points, as are most brilliant—
But try heart guesses at the ficndly meaningt jtr.d will tint die your debtor.
For ever—ob—fir ever !
Ob, who can bear to be a wretch for ever T
And as above, under the cracking roof ■ ■ Alicia can be the only possible objeft of the evening. For pity to Mrs. Ward—life would not be long buough.—Her fortitude—her zeal —ore both worthv a better fate.

S7>7 ■
What with the very virtuous zeal of Garrick. and indeed the fair claims of the object itself, the benefit of the Theatrical Fund, should never be forgotten 1—And it never can be— while we have such ailing as Mrs. Siddont, and Miss Farren, to make the people remember it.
But this is interest—principle in this small matter, there remains but little—and but with few, as with Sir W. W. Wynn, the Spencers, Lord Derby, Sir C. Bunbury, Sec.
The Imogen of Mrs. Siddons, was better, because better in voice, than usual.—This Madden, and Serjeant Bolton, whose Fulham Villas have her house between them, would set down to the credit of Fulham and its air.
All that appears changeable for the better, Was on this short passage—
“ How new !—Pisanio”—
Which should be given, as now punftuated— that is, “ how now,” the little exclamation on the discovery of her loss, the bracelet—“ Pisa*«,” a call for him—that it may be looked for —The reading last night was thus—
“How now, Pisanio?”
This brief note, perhaps as ridiculous as most notes,—yea, even as Warburton himself, and his “ parting kiss between two charming words,” has left us no place in our paper, to abtise, almost all the rest of the play.-For, the walls
of Houghton, who can tear—stript of their fine piftures, and now covered with printed copies ? —Nay we want room for the pleasanter office, the almost all praise the afting of the Farce— These are the things, King touches most inimitably.
As for Miss Farren—if the Comic Muse herself ■was to hnpersonify—more bewitching grace and .captivation there could not be !—more nature so fine, as not to want the aids of art '.—more art so refuted, as to mimic nature.
The Rehearsals, under the Duke of Cumberland, go on astonishingly at Covent-Garden, and Wild himself is not so wild as he!
Mrs. Wrighten is at length found !—with no Lord—but the Lord knows who—in Tooley-street:—A dealer in vitriol is the fortunate possessor of this lady ; and Mr. Wrighten has com-rrren'-ed his aft ion for the damage of his lost property. r- ' ;;	"	*	'' ~

The HEIRESS, with HARLEQUIN’S INVASION
,	THE PLAY-HOUSE.,	.
l h	--------
Mrs. SIDDONS.	‘	'
Zeal, ability, and success, all very transcendant, are the rejx>rt of Saturday night.
This advanced extremity of the season is too often deemed the rear-ward of the fashion ,—and as such, by most performers, has been neglected accordi	.
Eut . Siddons alone is able to disdain all this ; and to make the theatre look like February, when it feels like June!—With Lady Harcourt, Lady D. Thompson, below stairs, there was such a long &c. &c. that a vast deal of title and fashion were crowded elsewhere.—Lady Beaumont was in the front boxes ; Lady Tyrconnel, Lady Cunliffe, Lady Reade, and Lady Ingleby, above stairs.
The performance was better in this regard— that in the reading of the letter, the wonder finely rose with the excitement of it—in the narrative of the Witches making themselves air.
The words, “ He brings great news,” make a neutral point ; which Mrs. S. still direfts to the servant, instead of, perhaps the better mode of apostrophising apart.
But these a;e a single brick or two in the house of the pedant—mere atoms in a system— all the systematic arrangements of the play, and its great prevailing impressions, were sublimity itself! All that interests the imagination, that agitates the feelings, and works with humanising power over the heart—these are the attributes of the art, as practiced by her—and after her, by Kemble.
Kemble, with all these faculties, bears them so meekly, as to wave his right—the right of talents obviously superior—to the principal character, and takes a part which is subordinate. —But this is an incongruity to be borne no longer. It is
« The Cod of War
“ X-ieureror: volopH to tht Jîarf sf Mar.”
When thé Coalition was once talked of, at the Beef-steak Club, arid Lord North was wondered at, that once Prime Minister, he would take an office thus below—the Wittiest of the Family compleatly defended his father—said it was “ the self denying policy of virtue, sa“ crificing etiquette to accommodation. The “ great adter of the time playing Macduff ; “ and leaving Macbeth to his inferiors.”
In regard to Macbeth—the Queen’s Bon Mot is still too applicable. In the great scene before.the Murders all arc to envy the talents of Packer,: in addressing himself to Sleep, with sucli a noise at his chamber door.
Aickin is your only Witch ;—and Mr. Wil-•liames, not used to the melting mood, was \ouched himself, and therefore touched others, in one speech to Malcolm and Macduff.
Morelli, in the Abbey music, sung "the Lord is ei man- f War"—better far than at the rehearsal.—Mara in the divine-air — “Farewell, ye limfid streams/’ outdid herself.—The Royal box, which-was very full, was full also of applause. There were near two thousand four hundred people oresenr.	"

_________________
** The Sun not weary, makes a golden sat."
Mrs. Siddons 'succeeds in her experiments’ though Dr. Fothargill could not in his—under a tropical sky, his was the well-meant attempt to generate cold—Hers is the power, if not to generate cold, at least to make us insensible to its opposite. The Theatre had again the face of February, with the middle o£June !
Thus the last night was as distinguished as the first could be, in vogue and plaudit. Effort and merit need not be doubted. More of the finest influences from the art, more pathos in her herself, and more pathetic impression urged irresistibly on all around her—we never saw— we never felt.
Kemble too, whose genius, though not yet so ripely, exists as surely as his sister’s—had much that made us Wonder and weep. All the well contrived scenes in this extraordinary play—the scene with Renault, and with Pierre, before and after it—the opening of the play with Pri-uli, and Jaffier’s concluding scene with Belvide-ra, all were perfe&Iy exaCt, and yet as perfectly productive of great effect.
Such was the cunning of the scene last mentioned, Jaffier’s last parting with Belvidera, i that all praise is weak, and next to nothing, after the tears shed profusely by themselves first, and then by all around them.
This is doing all that Otway meant to be done. Genius aggrandising little things, and drawing good out of evil—working upon the affections, where the opinions fail—and tho’ there is nothing to moralize, yet making us feel.
Still however, the diamond, in respeCl to Kemble, was not polished perfectly. There were two or three points, he left less finished than we thought for—particularly when speaking of Bcl-videra, to Renault and Bedamar—he said Take her from my heart !
unbroken as.it now stands in print. The preferable mode had been
Take her—from my heart!
The three last words, ejaculating the anguish expressed on the separation.
But this perhaps may be dividing and subdividing over-much.
There is such a thing as starving a thought, by attempting to raise too many.
Bensley, Aickin, Packer, and PhilHmore, played with their usual degree of merit.
After the play, King came forward, in customary suit of solemn black, and delivered this! brief
SPEECH.
