THEATRE, HAYMARKET.

.Rob .fioy was performed last night. This Play, or
Opera as perhaps it has some right to be called, lias
been popular for a considerable time. It is natural,
vigorous, and interesting, qualities sufficiently rare
to give distinction to any work in which they are
found. The cast of characters last night was filled
with the principal comic and operatic force of the

jR.Ji

Miss CAREW, Diana Vernon; and L E E , Fran~
cis Osbaldeston. The performance was carried on
with spirit, and very frequently applauded. The
scene in the Inn where the Baillie distinguishes his
prowess was humo'irous. The skirmish on the Loch
side was a very good fragment of a battle, and
would have been a better one, had the combatants
been less fond of fighting under cover, for after the
first fire, the war was smothered behind the scenes,
and known to exist only from the roll of the drum.
Mrs. JOHNSON made a clever Helen, bold and characteristic. The songs were well sung, and Atdd
lang syne encored with great good humour. It is
the misfortune of the present representation, that
the play has been exhibited at other Theatres until
the respective parts have been identified with individuals. TERRY'S Rob Roy differing in some points
from that of Covent-Garden, seemed to the eye,
thus prejudiced, to deviate from nature, and yet his
acting was unaffected, forceful, and vivid. Miss
CAREW'S singing was of its usual sweetness ; but
she will not condescend to pronounce her words.
LEE'S voice was fuller than usual, but his shake requires the most diligent amendment. TAYLEURE
was lively and adroit, but he ought to learn the
pronunciation of the Scotch. The curtain fell with
applause.

Company. T E B R Y was Rob Hoy. DECAMP, Major
Galbraith ; T A T L E U R E , the Baittie;
WILLIAMS,
Owen; RUSSEL, Dugald; Mrs. JOHNSON, Helen;

Every one has his Fault was revived last night.
This was perhaps the most popular Comedy of one

it now, when its novelty is no more. The principal
characters were —

The Play is more remarkable for tei.derness than
vigour. It bears the evidence of a female pen ; it
is delicate and graceful; but character is often sacrificed to this feminine delicacy, and the interest
of the Play is sometimes impeded by the anxiety to
detect goodness in all its personages. Nothing but
the unquestioned and unquestionable magic of the
stage could effect this beneficent trick, for some of
those individuals are of rather sterner stuff than to
be easily melted into the mould of human kindness.
The plot is simple. Lord Norland is a harsh father,
who has expelled his only daughter for making an
injudicious alliance. The daughter and her husband. Captain Invin, are driven to extremity by
want, and Irwin, in a frenzy of passion and despair, attacks his father-in Jaw in the face of day,
and robs him. The wretched wife is driven into
double terror and misery by this proof of her husband's gui't. This scene was painfully interesting, and CONWAY'S acting was extremely animated,
natural and pathetic. His forciag the notes on his
wife, his reluctance to acknowledge the mode in
which they were obtained, and his final burst of indignation against the cruelty that had undone him
and his, were received with loud plaudits. But
there is an unexpected source of reconciliation.
Lord NorlandhaA adopted the child ofhis daughter,
I which was supposed to have been lost in infancy.
' The protege meets his mother, feels the impulses of
natural affection, and decides to adhere to her
through good and evil. Lord Norland touched by
this generous feeling, and the presence ofhis exiled
daughter, at length gives way, and consents to receive the whole unhappy and overthrown family into
his mansion. The underplot is tolerably spirited
and diversified. Sir Robert Hamble, a man of fortune and dissipation. His wife has obtained a divorce and resides with her guardian, Lord Norland,
whose first occupation seems to be that of finding
''another match for her. Mr. Harmony, extremely
well played by TERRY, is an universal peace-maker,
whose labour in life is to reconcile people to each
other, by the invention of complimentary opinions
for them. The catastrophe brings nil the characters
forwards, without much contradiction of nature. It
ends in a general submission to matrimony. Irwin
and his wife, as foremost in the interest and sorrows
of the play, are first in its joys. Sir Robert and his
former lady are determined on matrimony once
more. Mr. Solus, an old batcheler, is drawn in by
this matrimonial current, and marries Miss Spinster,
a fantastic oid woman, in a hoop. Mr. Placid resolves to endure his Xantippe still longer, and Harmony is the only remnant of single life that preserves
his jiberty. The acting was altogether spirited, and
when the next performance of this Comedy was
announced, the notice was received with very general applause.

Mrs. INCHBALD was the daughter of a Suffolk
farmer of the name of SIMPSON. From her infancy
she was Temarkably fond of reading, but the works
which found their way into a Suffolk cottage sixty
years ago were among the most exceptionable guides
to a young spirit, awaking to a perception of its
.
feelings. The Farmer's Daughter was inflamed with
romance. She had the dangerous gift of beauty,
and at seventeen she determined on following the
course of her heroines, and finding her way to fortune in London, Her first step in this city of gold
and pleasure was met by disappointment; the person on whose hospitality she was to rely, until
wealth and a titled suitor were flung together at
her feet, was absent. What lonely misery she now
suffered is only to be told by herself. But after
lingering till her resources were exhausted, she
turned to the stage. Her youth and beauty probably assisted her to an introduction, but she had a
slight impediment in her speech which made theatrical distinction hopeless. In the crisis of this
distress and danger, INCHBALD, an old man who
had some share in the Drury-lane Theatre, married
her. She was now secure from penury, but continued to play at the different Provincial Theatres,
till she grew weary of unsuccessful labour, and at a
time when no woman wrote, determined on trusting
to her pen. The authorship of the stage is, of all
authorship, the most repulsive and the most tempting. The least ambitious may be attracted by the
sudden distinction of a successful play—the most
resolute may be daunted by the obstacles that
beset the threshold of a Theatre. Mrs. INCHBALD'S
first adventure was bold, she soared at once into the
higher regions of the drama, and produced a comedy in five acts. Through what interest this comedy, which was entitled Fll tell you What, was
received, or from what cause it incurred the manage.'s neglect, is not told ; but it was laid in his repository of genius, forbidden to see the light, and
the author had her task to begin again. She had
now acquired wisdom, and made her experiment at
less expense of wit and time. She produced a farce.
The Mogul Tale, a piece which still keeps possession
of the stage. Her rejected comedy was now brought
forward, with a prologue by COLMAN. Diligence

THEATRE,

HAYMARKET.

The season closed at this popular and pleasant theatre
ob Friday night. This was the first attempt to establish
a system extremely important to the general interests of
actors, and sufficiently novel in the history of tbe stage—
the system of sustaining a summer theatre without depending on the winter ones. The result of success would
be virtually the establishment of a third theatre adequate
to cope with both through a considerable part of the year,
for we understand that the Haymarket is already allowed
to play daring eight months. As an additional result,
there would t.ius be a refuge for comedy, which now
leads so precarious a life between melo-drames and tragedies however mortal. But the difficulty of collecting
a company unconnected with the winter theatres was obvious. Theatric talent is probably as rare as talent of any
other kind. Of the multitude who fill the boards of t h e
provincial theatres, not one individual in a hundred is fit
to play any thing better " than hi* own fantastic tricks
before the Gods'' of his tillage. With the actor, London
is the natural p.int of ambition ; andfew as they are who
arrive in sight of that Cape of Good Hope, much fewer
can double it. Popular favourites are as valuable at they
are rare, and the purse and power of Covent-garden and
Drury-lane, made good prize of the performer. We
are not much disposed to be the panegyrists of managers, but it is mere justice to allow that the H a y market has struggled with a spirit worthy of success. In
comedy, Jones, Decamp, and Oxberry, were a very
p'easant trio ; Terry, the stage-manager, who performed in both tragedy and comedy, was an important '
member in both departments.
Mrs. Chatterley, a l lowed a larger field for her display, lias given on this
stage the evidence of faculties which promise, with
slight practice, to make her a public favourite.
Conway, exclusively a tragedian, sustained his rank . . d e r
the inconveniencies of a theatre, in which it had not
been the public taste to see tragedy, nor the managerial
habit tn rely upon its public acceptahe-?.
But the
London stage must be richer in great tragedians than
we have ever seen it, before it can wisely neglect
powers and advantages tike those of Conway,—a noble
form, asonorous .oice, dignified gesture, and spirited conception of character. The singular dearth of comic writing must have been among the heaviest difficulties of the
season. Colman, who might be the Aristophanes of the
age, seems to have abandoned the pen. We do not recollect that even a Farce of the ingenious author of Killing
no Murder has appeared. Towards the close, Mr. Kenny,
the Atlantei humeri, brought forward his very pleasant,
ba!f-serieus drama, as Mr. Dibdin had opened tbe season
with a work of much eccentricity and jest. But the public appetite for comedy was not duly fed, and this was altogether the most unproductive season in point of original
writing that we have known. The Op?ra, which in the
commencement only filled up the intervals of the more
substantial performances, has lately taken at least an equal
place with them. T b e rttiuJan/einMacheath^assucceeded to anextent that excites hopes of her future value, ami
with the aid of Miss C o r n , the Beggar's Opera bas been
extremely successful. Tbe manager lias now a period
before him for the exercise of h.s diligence. Until able
performers shall be discovered on the provineiat boards,
be must avail himself of those who have already fixed
llieinsel.es in public opinion. Their engagement may he
costly, but it is indispensable. A respectable and punctual manager has great advantages, and we are equally
inclined to expect, and to be gratified by a sensible and
successful preparation for the nest season. T h e principal
performance of Friday night was the Beggar's Opera-; the
house was full, and the audience seemed as much amused
as hitherto. Some of the songs were encored, ami the fine
irio in the condemned cell produced a kind of struggle
between those who were zealous for the song, aod those
whose gallantry was anxious to spare tbe singers. The
zpalots succeeded, and tbe trio was repeated with great applause. On the fall of the curtain, Terry came forward, and
delivered wilh much spirit & effect the tare'vel of the season.

prietor is fully aware: nevertheless, he enters own the
open field of public competition, prepared to struggle and
endure: he enters it at pnsent, indeed, with unequal
strength & surrounded by obstructions, yet he is wilting to
fight on, until he may at last succeed in establishing a
company, independent of the larger theatres, which,
through the full extent of his license, may have ajustand
equal claim to your support, in a theatre honourably devoted to all the legitimate purposes of the Britisi drama.
Much of the incipient difficulty which attends new attempts has, of course, been removed by the expeiment of
the present season, and much of l b " experience beneficial
to tuture efforts has been obtained ; and the proprietor desires me to assure you, that, with his means, his exertions
shall gradually encrease in every department, lompet the
wishes of an indulgent public, whom it is eqially his
duty, his interest, and his desire to secure. Eve-y alteration or addition by which the comfort, the convenience, or
the dramatic effectiveness of ibis theatre can be improved, |
shall be attended to, and no exertion on the proprietor's |
part shall be omitted to encourage rising talen, and to
secure such nf that already established, as time ind opportunity may render accessible to bim. 1 haje uow,
ladies and gentlemen, only to add the sincere lliar.ls of the
several performers for ihe liberal support you have
granted them, with which 1 beg most cordially K> unite
my »wn, and for the present'respectfully and gr.tefiilly
to bid you farewell."

an

This address was frequently applauded, and with peculiar force at the passages relating to tbe conversion of ihe
Haymarkel into a winter Theatre,& the manager's determinatioa to try his strength against the rival establishaeots,

" LADIES AND G E N T L E M E N , — I am deputed by the pro-

prietor to offer yon the customary return of his grateful
ackuowledgnierfts for the liberal support with which you
have seconded his anxious andarduousendeavours to establish an independent company in the new Haymarkettheatre. It would be tedious to detail to you the numerous
and pecnlianlifficulties of such an undertaking, as well as
the new and increasing obstructions with which this Itlile
establishment, so long the object of your favour (and, it
may almost besairt, of your affection) has now to contend.
•' Our short summer privilege, gradually encroached
upon^and each succeeding year made less and less by the
iovasionsofthewinterhoit.es, has at length been entirely
taken from us by one of them. Since, then, the winter
theatres are becoming summer ones, ami are striving utterly to deprive ns of that small portion ot the year
which had hitherto been left free to OUT use, it is but
fair (indeed it is the only chance we have remaining)
that we availing ourselves of the full extent of the Koyal
license granted to this property, -should in reti.ru en
desvonr as much a. possible to make the summer theatre
a winter one. Of the difficulty of this attempt, the pro-

I I I YM ASK I T THEATRE.—A Miss HART, from Bristol, made
tier first appearance here last night, as Miss Neville, in S/ie
Stoops to Conquer. Her person is rather petite, but her countenance is intelligent, her elocution good,.and her manner altogether not impleading. There are many subordinate parts
in comedy in which she may be placed with advantage. In
Miss Seville, however, we have been accustomed to more animation than this lady evinced- Mrs. CnATTEWtKY played
Miss llardtastle in excellent style. Her transition from the
disguise ol* the bar-maid to the tenderness of the-lover was
peculiarly touohing. It is scarcely necessary to observe that
LISTON'S Tony Lumpkin kept the house in continued laughter.
A new Comedy, called John Buzzby; or, a Day's Pleasure, was
performed on Wcducsd.iv night. The following is a sketch of
the Piolfc—
John Buzzby, a respectable London shopkeeper, wishing to
enjoy one day free from the troubles ot an overbearing wife,
and an impertinent Cockney sou in-law {Natty Briggs), pre
tends a journey to DepUbrd, on business, and in reality takes
a atage-co.ich trip to Richmond in search ol pleasure. Mrs.
Buzzby and her booby son thinking Mr. Buzzby safe in Kent,
determined also on a joyous expedition, and unluckily, to tho
very same place—vis. Richmond, and take with her Cecilia,
a ward of the Buzzbys, and whose fortune Mr*. Buzzby
wishes to secure by marrying her to Natty Briggs, John
Buzzby makes acquaintance in the stage coach with'an " interesting female," Julia, who is lately married to a naval officer,
(Andenon), and having formerly bad a thoughtless, though
perfectly innocent literary correspondence with a Captain
Greville, she goos to Richmond to ask Major Aubrey (uncle
to the Captain) to procure a restitution of her letters which
Greville bad improperly shown, and which she fears may
involve her husband, should he hearof it, in a duel. The Lady
finding in Buzzby every appearance of respectability, relics oil
that and bis age so far as to ask him to accompany her to the
Major's, I bat he might afterwards, if needful, attest the propriety of her visit, and from having, in bcr anxiety, imprudently forgot, before she left town, the necessity of a respectable companion. These circumstances the Lady is often
about to communicate to Buzzby, but isalways interrupted, and
the goed-naturcd and honest tradesman becomes her chaperon,
ou the credit ofber appearance, and in consequence gets into a
series of dilemmas, which turns his day of pleasure into one of
whimsical embarrassment and comic vexation, not a little
heightened by the arrrival cf Mr*. Buzzby, who is equally disappointed of her intended jovial day, by finding her husband
walking about Richmond with a line woman; and a military
officer claiming the hand of her ward. There are few attempts
at wit or repartee in the piece; the characters are slightly
drawn, but the situations have considerable merit; and on
these the success of a summer comedy chiefly depends. TERRY
played the citizen very well; Mr. W. WEST gave a live'y piclure of the Cockney ; and Mrs. PEARCE was quite overpower. ing in her shrillness as Buzzby's wife. The other performers
had few opportunities. Mrs. CUATTEULEY, the bar maid, was
always cut short by OXBEBRY, the innkeeper, who had nothing
himself to say worth bearing; and Mr. JONES, alt.io.gl! always
iyely, is notat allfit to play a gallant young officer, who has
no oddity to distinguish him. The play was given ont for repetition amidst the loud applause of an audience which filled
every part of the theatre. Report says Mr. KENNY is the
author.

H A Y M A R R E T T H E A T R E . — A new F a r c e ' w a s p r o duced last night, entitled Peter Fin, or A New t/oad to Brighton.
The characters w ere cast as follows:—Peter Fin, Mr. LISTON ;
Harry Ttirtleton, Mr. UAKSII; Frederick Comer, Mr. JOHNSON;
Morgan, Mr. YoDNeEIt; Harriet, Mrs. OAR.ICK ; Mary, M n .
F i a n c e ; Sally, Mrs. BAKER. The Farce is the production of
a Mr. Jo-its, of Edinburgh, and an avowed adaptation from
the French, founded on the following incidents:—Peter Fin
is a fishmonger of fortune, who never saw the sea, and
leaves off business, in consequence of a magnificent bequest
left him and big daughter, on condition they never sleep
under the same roof with a certain cousin, Henry, who
would, in' tbe occurrence of snch an event, be entitled io
dispossess his more fortunate relatives of the fortune, from
which he bad been disinherited for some youthful follies.
Peter, as before observed, had never Been tbe sea, but always
bad an unconquerable desire tt> visit the shores of that element
from which he had derived bis former consequence in trade.An old friend ( Morgan) with whom be bad planned a trip to
Brighton, disappoints bim, but promises-to send a young map
instead as Em's guide to Brighton. A r opsin, Frtdairk, avails
himself of this circumstance; gets his friend, Harry Turileton,
to pass himself off on Peter for A/organ's substitute, who, after
driving the old fishmonger and bis daughter great part of the
night in a close carriage round the envirous of London* lands
him in Bedford-square, which Fin mistakes for Brighton;
there the disinherited cousin is introduced under the d*s-

•'-A*

c.<.:

.:

a

uise of a French Nobleman, prevails on Peter and Harriet
o sleep at his supposed' Marine Villa, by which means their
ffortune
is forfeited; but on tne Cousin's offering to share i t

with the Lady, tbe fishmonger is reconciled;- and, after .
number of whimsical mistakes, arising from Era's supposing
London to be Brighton, be joins in the laitgh against himself, attd agrees to set off with the new*-married couple on
a real visit to the Marine Pavilion. Though the piece is
avowedly taken from the French, tbe main incident appears
to have been derived from tbe excarsian of Ton* hcmgkn withbis Mother in' She Stoops to- Conqxer. But whatever its ori^irv
may have been, the plot is- rattier too simple for the English
taste, especially as it belongs to u-spec.es of .Drama in which
we are more aecustotned telook (or bustle mrd variety than it*
any other stage production whatever. An'nng the scenes which
we conceive to be most deserving ot commendation, was that
in winch the parties convert, at tbe breakfast table. Fin't
conversation wHb Frederiet, who assumes the disguise of a
French Count,- produced a good deaf of laughter, and his confnsion upon finding himself ia St. Giles's instead of Uio sett
shore.- was another sitiratioa which could not fail Is entertain
when displayed with tbe humour »f Mr. LB-OH-. AH the performers exerted themselves to the utmost, and tbe Farce may
be said to have been weil received, though in one or two instances there were some .fight symptoms ef discontent.

HiyjiAREET.— The Marriaye of Figaro was played on
Saturday night. Miss PATON made her debut in the part of
Susanna. This young lady was already .mown at the Concerts ;
and high expectations were formed of her success in the difficult
exertions of the stage. This antcipation has been thoroughly
justified, and Miss PATON may fairly indulge the hope that it is
only a prelude to many triumphs not less brilliant nor less deserved. Miss PATON is hi her person tall and well made, and her
face and features handsome and expres-ive. Her voice, in
speaking, is full and agreeable ; and, in singing, possesses
sweetness, flexibility, volume, and compass. She exhibited
from the drawing up of the curtain the most perfect composure
sad s.'lf-possessicn ; and had more the manner of an experienced
il-tress, than of one " h o for the first time " smelt the lamp."
She sang the opening duet with much precision and taste, and
with great expression-^thc rarest of all qualities in singers, but
at the same time, when combined with power, the surest means
of attaining popularity. It was encored. Bid m- discourse.
which she introduced, was distinguished by the same mark of
approbation. Her intonation was here shown to be remarkably
pure, her shake clo.s-, even, and regular, and her musical feeling, if we may use the expression, exquisite. These two
were tliemost strikiogeBorts of th? night. As an actress Miss
VATONhasnoinccnsiderableprai.se. Her delivery is clear and
distinct, and she has intelligence, feeling, and spirit. With diligence and a strict adherence to the rules of science and good
taste, Miss PATON may confidently expect to occupy an eminent
station amongst the popular favourites of the stage. A really
safe aid valuable reputation is only to be gained a.id preserved
by incessant exertion and resolntt- perseverance. Mrs. UARaiCK played the Canutes*, and was deservedly applauded. She
has power, execution, and competep science. Mrs. CHATTERIV'S
Cherubiiio is somewhat too hard and abrupt; but the partis
an awkward and dangerous one for the stage at all, and is easterated into a mero frolicsome boy in the English translation.
JONES played Almaviea, and I.-STCW. Figaro. The laiter announced the Optra for repetition, amidst loud and general applause.

The School for Scandal was performed Jiere on Thur-d.iy,
but calls for nu specific observation, as both the Charles of
Mr. C.KF.VBLE,

and the Lady Teazle of Mrs. CHATTERLEY

are known to the town. The latter is gradually acquiring
acknowledged rank in genteel comedy; her recent performi a
ance of Charlotte in the Hypocrite has proved particularly effective. The Sir Peter Teazle of TERRY is an excellent dry
and caustic reading of the fond and perplexed husband of a
young wife. The Joseph Surface of JOHNSON was passable;
but the actor in question cannot sufficiently look the grave,
sentimental, yet elegant and Chesterfieldian Jostph. We are
glad to perceive that this company perseveres in the enactment of regular comedy, which is almost exploded at the
Winter Houses. Thalia, in a genteel domestic garb, should
find a refuge somewhere.
On Thursday night we attended this theatre to witness the
representation of the opera of the Barber of Seville. Miss
PATON assumed the character of Ros<na, which she acted and
sang with the same ease, spirit, and felicity, which marked
her Susanne. As far as acting is concerned, the latter is much
l l •-• ' • "-ore a piece of common-place than the former character; but
it is remarkable with what composed vivacity Miss PATOJJ
gets through all of which, in this respect, it is capable We
certainly never saw a step on to the stage, which can any way
be compared to hers. She has taken to it as to a native element, and with something of the intuitive aptitude of a young
duck for the water. The style and spirit of her musical execution of Kosma were decidedly effective; and displayed a
similar proficiency, both as to acquired and natural powers,
as her Susanne. Her duet with Fivrelto, and more particularly
her ballad at the harpsichord, were highly and rro3t deservedly
applauded. Miss PATON ought to be content, for the severest
thing we have yet heard said of her is, that she ha3 not displayed the decided power and brilliancy of a CATALANI or a
BtLLiNGTON. Negative panegyric of this kind has something
. very positive about it we dare say that Miss PATON IS satisfied. LISTON being the Figaro, and JONES the Count Almaviva, as at Covent-garden, we have nothing more to remark
on the general performance, except that the Bartoh of W I L LIAMS was good, and the Fwrello of LEONI L E E faint but
respectable.

HAVMABKET THEATRE.—Tuesday night a new Farce —as

produced, entitled Family Jars. The characters and plot are as follow :—Mr. Peter Porcelain, Mr.T-ERav; Benedict Porcelain, Mr.
LEONi L E E ; Delph, Mr. LISTOK ; Dtggory Delph, Mr.OxBEBRY;
Emily, Mra.GABRicK ; Ltddy, Mrs. PEARCE.—Mr. Porcelain, a
respectable chinaman, being about to retire from business, forms
the project of marrying his son (Benedict) to the daughter of his
partner; and his foreman (Delph) has also an intention of
marrying his son (Diggory) to a relation. Both the sons, bow.
ever, being clandestinely married, find it requisite to maka their
fathers acquainted with the circumstance; for which purpose
Benedict secures the intercession of Delph with Porcelain, and
Diggory solicits Porcelain to advocate liis cause with Delph,
which gives rise to a double equivoque, for Ltddy (the wife of
Diggory) being concealed in an upper apartment of the warehouse, encounters Porcelain, whom she mistakes for the father
of her husband, and who is exceedingly disgusted with his son's
supposed choice, and Emily, the wife of Benedict, coming to
the bouse to solicit forgiveness for her husband, meets
with Delph, whom she mistakes for Porcelain, while be conceiving her to be the wife of Digqory, is delighted with bis imagined daughter-in-law. Meantime the disappointed partners
insisting on a partition of stock, the parties are brought together
in the warehouse, when an ecktircitsement takes place, and the
respective fathers become satisfied with the election of their sons.
This piece it seems is a translation from the French, like Peter
Fin, the tact and manner of which it exceedingly resembles;
depending in the same manner almost entirely on the talent of
the actors. French dialogue will not succeed unassisted in
English translation, the neat and pointed vivacity evaporates in
the process, andleaves little or nothing in its place. LISTOK and
T E R R Y , as the two fathers, were excellent; the latter, -we have
no doubt, made half his own part, which in this instance, although
not always so, was an advantage. OXBERRV, as the booby son
of Delph, and Mrs. PEARCE, as his Irish wife, were also very
effective auxiliaries; the unaffected naivete of the latter was
particularly relished. The music, by PARRY, was passable, and

• JJ.MM.-.I ' Ijwr It-ft**.

-sdT
*taO

AT

passably executed by Mrs. GARRICK and Mr. LEONI L E E . The

new scenery is also very well; and thus supported, the audience
expressed more satisfaction than possibly the dramatic fitness of
things required. This house fills remarkably well.

THEATRICAL EXAMINER.

il.lVM.illKET.

A NEW musical farce was brought out at this Theatre on
Monday evening, borrowed, like Peter Fin, from one of the
pieces acted at a minor French Thentre; and, we shrewdly
suspect, adapted by the English transplanter of the said
Peter. The plot is soon unfotded: Porcelain, a respectable
dealer in earthenware, purposes to retire, and give up his
business to his son Benedict, who is to marry his sleeping- partner's daughter. Porcelain lias an old, rude, but faithful"" shopman, of the name of Dclpk, who, as a reward for his services,
he iutends shall retire and partake of otium cum di^nitate along
with him. Now it happens that the servant-has also a son,
a lout of a lad b. ought up in Yorkshire, whom his father intends to marry to his own cousin, Lucy Lutestring. Both the
sons, however, choose for themselves, and get married clandestinely to the objects of their preference, and it so fails out,
that young Porcelain employs old Delph to break the truth to
his father, whilst young Delph requests precisely the same
favour of old Porcelain. V oung IMTS. De/ph, who is concealed
in the house, overhearing the elder Porcelain talk of subscribing for the suff .ring Irish, takes him for her father-in-law,
Delph, and addresses him as his daughter-in-law, describing
herself as an honest Irish girl, the daughter of a bricklayer's
labourer, who had left Ireland in consequence of the very
distress he was so anxious to relieve: she then informs hiffl
that his son fell in love with her whilst cheapening a scrag of
mutton in Clare-market. This overwhelms old Porcelain with
dismay at his son's vulgar taste and'extreme degradation. In
the mean time, the real Mn. Porcelain mistakes old Delph for
the father of her husband, and fills him with delight at
the address of his booby son, who has secured the handsome
daughter of a captain in the navy, -with a thousand pounds.
The result is easily anticipated. Porcelain is delighted that
his son has married a respectable young lady, and the whole
of the Delphs are taken under protection.
It will be seen that there is no want of materiel for good
equivoque; and, thanks to the talents of TERRY and LISTOX,
the two fathers, it was not altogether thrown away. At the
same time their merit is tne greater, as the author gives them
little or nothing to say, a situation in which we vefily believe
LISTON luxuriates, as he then can say and do what he pleases,
of which license he sometimes avails himself when it is by
no means so allowable. Supported by the dry humour of
TEEBV, and LISTON'S irresistible drollery, notwithstanding a
mostobtnisivelackof originality, and of piquancy in the jests or
dialogue, Family Jan was most unequivocally applauded; the
good-humour b»mg much aided by OXBB»KY'S booby, and
still more by the Irish girl of Mrs. I'EAKCE, which was really
a very clever piece of acting, and that too with very little oreracting to assist the impression. We know not, indeed, whether the unexpected naivete of this brief scene did not do
much to confirm the good-humour of the audience who we
!
it at one time «eemed disposed to be of the opinion of
his Grace the-Dafc', in High Life Mow Stain tanA to pronounce
it d—d loin, which the critics did \ ery gravely i n the papers next
morning. l a respect to vulgarity, it possibly may smack; but
then it is J. farce. We must not forget to remark, thai a pretty
song or two were sung by M I . L E O M I.EE and Mrs.G'RiucK,
a duet between whom wag loudly encored. The scene of a
China Shop was good.
In this piece, we apprehend, the town has followed the '
advice o< STEII.*. ., and been pleased " it knows not why, and .
cares not wherefore." We would, however, jug) recommend I
| arsons who adapt French trifles to our stage, |
ih.'t a great d?ai of the epigrammatic neatness of a French reply <
is lost by transfer into English, and consequently an entire ref the dialog
'sary- Had J.I.ITOX'S p,iri fallen
into It
. the farce would have been inevitably |
damned in '
a*}; and the same observation maybe
applied to Peter Fin. «
-reat triumph to the actor;'
bu', after ail, he might as v. ell have some merit to represent
as well as his en
dy observed, th? audience were notwithstanding pleased,—so, a fig for the cntic=!

HAYMARKET THEATRF..

A Den Opera was brought out en Monday night .1 this theatre, called " Morning, Noon, and Night ; or, the Romance
of a D a y . " M r . Dibdio ii .aid to be the author of this play,
.nil it certainly b e a r , about it the broad mark* of his hand.
T h e plot is twofold, nnd the two plot. (according to custom)
have nothing at all to do with each o t h e r : — Lord A v . d a v . t
(.Mr. T a j l e u r e ) h a . a son. Lord Scribblelon ( M r . Liston),
whom be would marry to t h e daughter of his frieod Sir Simon
Saveall. O u r readers may guess at the character of L >nl
Scribbleton ; h e is a novel-writing nobleman, a publishing
p e e r ; he has travelled, like Reynolds's Altradorlf, and he
makes verses, like S h e r i d a n ' s Sir Benjamin B a c k b i t e : moreover, he sees a spectre at every s t a i r h e a d , and looks for a
robber in every corner cupboard, and would almost consent to
let himself be assassinated, if he might but live a l t e r - a n l s to
describe the operation. T h i s romance of Lord Scribbleton
furnishes all the comedy of the piece. Miss Lydia and his
Lordship having never seen each other, Sir Simon Saveall
rides over to the mansion of Lord Avadavat, intending m
carryback his son-in-law in his hand ; but genius revolts at an
introduction so ordinary, and the peer privately departs without waiting for th« B a r o n e t , determined to have a meeting
mure interesting!; and poetical, T h i s brings us for a moment
to Ihesecond action of the piece. Amelia ( M r s . l l . J o h n s t o n ) ,
wife to Captain Saaguine, is shipwrecked on the c a s t of
K e n t , near Sir r-iuion S a v e d ! ' * house. Shark ( M r . T e r r y ) , .
reformed smuggler and highwayman, preserves h t r , with her
children, from being plundered by the wreckers, and ennducis
her lo " The B u s h " I u n , where he is himself no welcome
guest. To.the same house, " The B u s h , " come, j u s t at the
same moment, Captain Sauguine with an Irish servant, and
Lord Serit>b'eloB with a F r e n c h v a l e t : my Lurd .Scribbleton i .
going to Sir Simon Saveall's home, to ask lodging as a benighted traveller, and to behold his mistress, himself remain
ing n n k a s w n . Captain Sangnine is pursued, as stage captain*
usually arc, by bis c r e d i t o r s , and desires to be unknown, from
an apprehension of being arrested. T h e leud between M r ,
Shark ana the people of T h e Bush brings on an rqi/ivoque,
which is the best t h i n g in Mr. Dibdin's piece. Lord Scribbleton, who passes for disguise as a commoner, i . i h o w n t s a
room in which Shark is supposed to be silting ; Captain S a n guine, who passes for disguise as a nobleman, is shown (the
h ' U i r hciiig lull) into the same a p a r t m e n t ; Shark, suspecting
possible foul play, haa privately quitted his quarters', and Mr.
Lislon tilitis the room to which he is directed e m p t y ; but
Captain Sanguine is cautioned by the landlord's daughter that
there will be . tiigbwayman in his a p a r t m e n t ; and, finding
no one there but M r . Liston, of course mistakes him for tli«
thief. T h i s aeene, although of little value in description, told
well in representation. Lord Scribbletun, boasting to San
guine of his novelistic exploits, the latter takes the fables
for real achievements, and supposes him not only the most
daring, but the most impudent of depredators. Oa a sudden
the F r e n c h valet, hearing that his lord iswith a robber, appears
with loaded pistols, and p u l l them into 8. ribbleton's b a n d ; at
the same instant the Irish servant, seeing bailiffs surround
the inn, rushes in with a broadsword, and desires his master
to " f i . , h t it u u t ; " Sanguine flies from the bailiffs, ihir-kit-g
Seribbletnn still a highwayman, and Seribbleton himself the
next moment is arrested for Sanguine's debt. A considerable
portion of M r . D i b d i n ' s second act is occupied with an attempt by the landlord of T h e Bush upon the property of Mrs.
Sanguine. Shark again interferes, and carries her to t h e mansion of Sir Simon Saveall. I s Ike mean Is-ic, Sir Simon having returaed t o his dwelling, apprises his daughter that her
lover .Till visit her in disguise and p r e p a r a t i o n are set on foot
.ogive him a brilliant reception. T h e n comes equivoque m o
second. Capt. Sanguine being i-cally benigbted on the road,
knocks at Sir Simon's for shelter, and is welcomed as L - r d
Scribbleton. H e imagines there must be some mistake, fro..»
the courtesy with which he is treated ; but ali his «ndeav«uts
to unravel the mystery a r e attributed to his inveterate fondness
for disguise T h e real Lord Scribblelon shortly after a r r i v e s ,
attended by bailiffs, and threatening vengeance for the d e t e n tion. N o sooner does h e show himself where he looks for
iostant acknowledgment, than Sanguine recollects him as t h e
highwayman of the Bush I n n ; and he is conveyed (bailiffs a n *
all) for immediate security into the cellar. T o e events which
follow upon t h i s iocarceraimn we have neither room nor inclij nation lo describe in detail. T h e r e ia a disguise by _Miss
Lydia, which we excuse on account of the purpose which it w a .
I to a n s w e r , and a mistake arising nut of M r s . Sanguine's coming into Sir Simon's house through a trap-door, instead of t h e
ordinary entrance. Eventually the ihamalis persona return to
their proper shapes and nominations ; and happiness and ptwdon brgin to bring matters towards conclusion. M r . Sanguinerecovers bis wife and children ; Lord Scribbleton is encouraged
la hope (or the favour of Miss Lydia ; and, up«n a finale i a
Sir Simon Saveatl's cellar, at last the curtain falls.
Miss Paton plated Lydia. H e r powers unfold themselves
as she gains confidence upon the stage. T h e r e was a sweetness
aud a fluidity about bet voice last night, exceeding even t h e
vary high quality for which we had given her c r e d i t ; and ber
execution was at once so facile and so brilliant, as to give currency to ieve.al songs which cimld scarce have hoped for such
I consideration. T h e best thing she had from Mr. T e r r y waa .
| bravura in the last . c t , which reminded us in more passage*
than one of • T h e S o U i e r t i r e d ; " the best thing she did, and
the thing that went very materially to aave tile opera, was h e r
" Mary of Castle Gary," in t h e Scotch disguise towards t h .
conclusion. We pardoned t h a t disguise, though it was past U n
o'clock, for t h e sake of the ballad which it served to introduce.
Miss Fatoa sang t h e song wilbdul music, and was rapturously
e n c o r e d ; had it been earlier in the evening, she would have
been called «n a third time. Liston played admirably; h i s
sentimental coxc-mb is an exquisite treat ; there is a solemnity and a deep feeling about his countenance which is truly
laughable. T e r r y ' s part had little connexion with the main
objects of the piece. Williams played well ; and M r . J o h n s o n
( s s C p t . SaBguise), very well. T n e Opera is, however, too
long, and will bear curtailment. It was well received by the a u dience, &. has been performed every night since wilh a p p i a w e .

IIAYMARKE

T THE A TRE.

fhi- summer theatre opened last night for the season,
and was full to the extent of convenience in every part.
Of the new prelude, taken from an old play, and presented
for the first time, in one act, under the title of Summer
Flies, or the Will for the Deed, all that we deem necessary
to notice, is the cordial, and even enthusiastic reception which was given to Mr. TERRY. The actor must
" have been highly gratified by a testimonial which so evidently stamped him as a prime favourite among the frequenters of this resort of hilarity. With respect to the
prelu de itself, its repetition m a r be convenient to those
••" : lovers of a whole play to whom it is, nevertheless, more
•H agreeable to go to a theatre at eight than at sfcen o'clock.
The comedy (for so it is called) which succeeded, A Cure
for the Heart Aclte, demands more particular notice ; not,
indeed, for the pecidiar merit of the composition (though
it is very far from being the worst of those sentimental
extravaganzas which aspire, without any very rigid attention to consistent probability of incident and character, to
make us both laugh and cry), but for the manner in which
it was in several of its parts sustained. Miss BOYCE, indeed, is no proper representative of Ellen I'ortej'; nor did
we think Mr. WILLIAMS quite at home in the Xahoh—albeit, he is an actor of some humour. And we were sorry to
observe so much out-of-character pedantic dandyism in the
Youug Stanley of Mr. BARNARD, of whom, some years since,
wensed tohopebetterthings. But VMII*OUWM respectable
in Sir Hubert Stanley, and HAMMOND something more in
Firmer (Jutland; andMr.W.W*EST,iuJlVan.tOa.,ta.«t,reminded us, without disparagement, of the frank rustic simplicity
of little KNIGHT; though, at the same time, there was
nothing in the performance that looked like imitation.
But the main supporters of the piece are VINING and
LISTON. The Old Rapid of the latter is too well known to
require particular comment. There are few of the characters
of LISTON in which we can see him with such genuine and
legitimate pleasure ; for in this he is content to be characteristic and natural; and the pathetic parts in particular,
reminded us (which in the mere laughter-seeking drollery
of many of his parts we are sometimes compelled to
forget) that he can be, when he pleases, an actor. How
superior is the rude and natural pathos which makes us at
once smile and weep to the mere grimace and shape-making which court only the plaudits of the groundlings. How
much better is it, in fact, to awaken the .mingled emotions of an audience in the proper place, than, in defiance
of all place and season, to set the actors themselves in a
titter when they ought to be attending to the business of
the scene. But if LISTON is sometimes a spoiled child,
and plays off his moody tricks when he ought to be attending to his part, the town may thank themselves for having
made hiin so. His performance of Old Rapid shows
how capable he is of much better things. The
Young Rapid of VINING, from the Bath Theatre,
who inatie his first appearance here on
this occasion, was buoyant, gay, and dashing to the full
heighth of the conception of the author. If he plays other
volatile and eccentric characters as he performed this, he
will be indeed a valuable acquisition i to the London
boards, and the winter houses may contend for him. He
is perfect mercurialism. There is an ease, a grace, an
elastic spontaneity in his motions and his utterance, which
we should suspect must qualify him for a considerable
range of character. Let him take care, however, that
his buoyancy does not carry hjm beyond the line of de. corum. We did net find any thing of this description in
'
the present instance, but we thought we discovered in
• him a vivacity which might easily be urged to such .xcess.
- An incipient Mereutio should not be spoiled by rushing
too far into the caricature of farce; nor must the .At!*..
Vortex of Mrs. OHGER be passed by without its share of
commendation. The rnock gentility, and the mock sensibility of the money-made fine lady, were admirably sustained by her throughout; and she may be said to have
made- of the character all of which the character is susceptible. We wish we could say as much for the Jes*y \
Gotland of Mrs, CHATTEBLEV ; but the fact is, that Mrs.
C herself prevented us from taking any notice of her
acting. We are sorry for this. We have been among
the earliest of her admirers.
We take some ere- '
dit to ourselves for pointing out-her incipient merits
before either managers or the public seemed to
be aware of them; and we have therefore marked
her progress with particular interest. But we must remind Mrs. C., that among the requisites of dramatic r»'presentaticn, it must not be forgotten that of dressing
t a character with characteristic decorum. We remember
this lady, upon a former occasion, spoiling the character
of Mrs. Loveinore, in the If'ay to keep Him (though in
other respects it was as good a piece of acting as we
would wish to see) by the fashionable tlegance of,her
morning dress, when the whole plot and moral of the
piece turns upon the disgust taken by her gay and fashionable husband at the almost sluttish negligence of his lady
in this particular. And in the present instance, the rustic
simplicity of the farmer's daughter, Jesxy Oatiand (which,
properly presented, should be the mast interesting character in the piece) was utterly destroyed by the ostentatious fashkntableness of the heart-dress, with her fantastic straw hat, cocked up behind, her elegant braids of
hair and profusion of artificial flowers, like a masquerade
Pattora at a St. James's dress ball. We could not think
oi' J'sty Out land or her sorrows through all the play—
we cou)<J think of nothing bat the gala head-dress.— j
Family .fart followed, in which the only novelties were
W. WEST'S Diggory Jjelph, and Mrs. C JONES'S Liddy.— I
Bat w« have already tiespassed all limits, and must r e - 1
serve these for another occasion.

HAY MARKET

THEATRE.

COLEMAN'S five-act Farce (Comedy, as he calls it), the
Heir at Law, was acted last night at this Theatre, and to a
well-filled house,'for the town, it seems, relishes these preternatural absurdities. For our parts, we are pretty well
tired of all that sort of thing; and deeming the play in itself beneath all criticism, we should not have noticed it,
only that in this case it produced some novelty. VIKING,
whom we thought so highly of in Young. Rapid, did what
could be done with i>je* Dowlas, but as the part has less
of dashing eccentricity, without a spark more of nature
and probability in it than the former, he had not an opportunity of appearing to equal advantage. A Mrs. JONES,
from the Norwich Theatre, made her first appearance here
as Deborah Dowlas, alias Lady Duberly, and may pass
muster very well in chaiacters of this description. W.
WEST played Homespun, upon the whole, with considerable
effect, but we did not think him quite so clear from apparent imitation of KNIGHT in this character, as on Monday
night. He is an actor of merit jr. his line; but we advise him to trust to nature and to himself, and to be no
man's double. We would hint to him also, that whatever be the humour or dialect of the character he is to
support, an actor should take care to preserve so much of
distinctness as' to render his part of the dialogue always
intelligible. LTSTON'S laughability in Old Dowlas, alias
Lord Duberly, is well known to all the lovers of broadcast humour; but of the rest of the characters it is no unkindness to be silent. The play was followed by a pleasant little dramatic trifle, presented for the first time,
under the name of Mrs. Smith. It ought to have been,
The Two Mrs. Smiths ; for all the pleasanUy and equivoque
arises from there being two ladies of that name resident
in the same lodging-house—one of them (Mrs. OKI.LK), a
married lady, who, with her husband (LISTON), a strange
sort of a quarelsome, jealous-pated Worcester Esquire, has
been residing there some little time, and is expecting a
visit from her uncle; and the other (Mrs. CHATTEKLF.Y), a
sprightl}, dashing widow, who having got happilyrid of a disagreeable husband, imposed upon her by the
authority of parents, is just come to town to meet a second
husband of her own choice, a Mr. IVentworth (VINING),
and is expecting also a friendly visit from her uncle a Mr.
Stanley (WILLIAMS'). It may be readily imagined what a
variety of laughable perplexities (the ladies and their
names being equally unknown to each other and to each
other's connections; may arise out of this ambiguity ; and
it will as easily be concluded that as soon as the ladies
happen to meet, the difficulties and embarrassments are at
an end, and all are made happy. The piece was very well
acted through all its characters—even to the most subordinate. It kept the house in a roar of laughter ; and was
given out by LISTON for repetition amid universal plaudits.

We congratulate the manager on his discretion in laying
aside the flat and uninteresting prelude The /fill for the
Deed, and acknowledge, at the same time, the policy of
having some petite piece before the comedy, as it accommodates those who dine at fashionable hours, without inconveniencing those who can be more early in their attendance. The introductory selection of Saturday night
( Tlte Romp) was especially gratifying, as it gave us an opportunity of being amused agaiu with an old favourite,
Miss i*. Booth, without the penalty of being detained to
a late hour in the theatre. The town seemed to sympathise with us in this respect, for the bouse was filled at an
early hour, and it was evident that our little merry favourite had lost no portion of her public attraction by her long
absence from the London boards. . The pleasant absurdity,
of which Prucilla Tomboy forms the chief attraction, was
well performed throughout, with the exception only of
Captain Sightly, whose representative seemed to have
forgotten" that dressing like a dandy, and ttanding
like a pott, are not the only requisites for sustaining
even that subordinate description of character, technically called a walking gentleman. What has come
to Barnard '! He once seemed to have some talent, and
some capability of utterance. Has disappointment sunk
him into enuvi? or has he forgotten that the best way of
getting into a better line of character, is for the actor to .
do his best with whatever is intrusted to him ? This performer seems of late to slumber through his characters, as
though he scorned his profession, and could not condescend to keep his mind for three minutes together in the
scene. Even the joyous vivacity of little Booth could not
electrify him, though it was a perpetual stimulus to the
hilarity of every other person in the house. The Pritcilla .
of this lively actress is, in fact, every thing that
could be conceived of such a character. It has had
no such representative since the days of Mrs, Jordan;
and were Mrs. Jordan alive, and in her prirpe again, ,
even she could not make more of it. The bounding buoyancy of her spirit redeem, even all the
nonsense of the piece; and makes the incongruous caricature of farce not only supportable, but delightful. The
comedy of The Hypocrite succeeded, and, though we went J
only to see Miss Booth, we were tempted to sit it out; and I
were well rewarded, although Dowton was not there, with
his masterly and inimitable personation of Doctor Cardveil. Terry, however, was more than respectable in the
character: and in the last scene, where the impostor
throws off the mask, and displays the remorseless effrontery of the detected demon, he was not, perhaps, inferior
to bis justly celebrated competitor. The comedy was
ably supported. Baker, in DarnUy, is at least equal to
any thing we are used t<* meet with '•< this line of character ; Younger was very decent .
Sir John ; Miss
Boyce somewhat better than usual in Young Lady Lambert ; and Mrs. Jones* had all the conventicle about her
(tone, look, and demeanour) in the methodistical Old
Lady. John-ton, indeed (the Col. Lambert'', cannot iu any |
thing entirely divest himself of affectation, and his car- * — •
riage is not correctly military; but his performance upon
the whole was by no means below par. Of Liston it must
be acknowledged, that he wai not exactly Matc-ivorm,
but of course he was abundantly laughable. The fault is,
that he takes a part of the joke to himself, and seems to
know how funny he is ; whereas the solemn and sanctified
ignorance of this lield-pre»ehing informer and tupprestor
of vice should leave the joke and fun exclusively to the
audience, and appear to have neither volition nor consciousness in the absurdity. His sermon, however, over
the screen top, in the last scene, was admirable, »nd convulsed the house with laughter. But the gem of the performance was Mrs. C'hatterley's Charlotte. The teasing,
layful half-coquetry of the character could not, we think,
_e more appropriately or more fascinatingly exhibited; and
the tranquil lady-lika contempt displayed in the scene with
Dr. Cantice'.l, and the pathos tirawn into the expostulatnry
scene with her father, were equally well sustained, Let
Mrs. C always play thus, and be true, In all rttpeeit, to
the character she undertakes, and she will never leant the
tribute of commendation- But no more g a l . head-dresses
for maid-servants and rustic daughters of poor bankrupt
farmers. The attendanpe and the applause commanded
by this admirable and legitimate comedy might convince
our managers that the taste of the to-rn is not yet so
| degraded that nothing but broad grins and melo-d.yuaatic
\ monstrosities can remunerate the proprietors of a theatre.

HAY MARKET

THEATRE.

.v\A *f-*T

Though Kenny's pleasant eccentricity, Sweethearts and Wives, does
not seem to have lost Its .(tractions by repetition, the manager, on
Saturday night, thought fit, in the absence of Madame Vestris, to treat
the town with a little variety , and we think he did well. for although
Mils Love has risen to unexpected eclat in the line of saucy and flippant chambermaids, and her voice has developed itself to a degree
of pow-r andfaacl nation, which, two year* ago, no lover of song in all
probability had anticipated . still it is to characters of this description
that her talents are inevitably circumscribed. The gentlewoman sit*
uneasily—we may even say aokwardly upon her; and she is a very
indifferent substitute, in the lively and elegant Laura, for such a
dinger and actress as Madame Vestris. We were glad, therefore, to
be presented on Saturday with a revival of The Barber nf Se+iltr.
Miss Paton's Bosina must be familiar to the greater part of the playgoing public, from her frequent appearance in that character at
Covent Garden ; and she performed it on this occasion, upon the
whole, with her accustomed spirit. If there were one or two of her
song* that did not appear to be executed in her very best style, she
made ample amends in the song at the piano, May and Winter can
ncrer agree, in which the expressive liveliness of her acting, as well
as the clear rich brilliancy of her unrivalled shake, electrified the
whole house, and produced one of the heartiest and most universal
encores we ever renumber to ha-t- witnessed. Vining supported the
part of Cwtnt Almadvn with effective vivacity. Liston's Figaro is too
well known to need particular comment. It is Indeed one of his best
characters—one that affords in the acting sufficient scope for laughprovoking pleasantry, without inducement or pretence for that extra
characterestic buffoonery in which he is too prone, on many occasions,
to indulge , and which, "though it make the unskilful .manv laugh,
cannot but make the judicious grieve." We should be glad, that the
beautiful duets, glees, &e.f in which Figaro has to join, could be
helped by a rather better voice ; and we can scarcely say that they
were so by Mr. Leonl Lee—who, in Fioretlo, appeared to be just as
self-satisfied, and, to all other purposes, as unmeaning as usual.
Hammond's yawn, in Argus, was irresistible : it seemed to give the
whole audience a sort of sympathetic spasm of the jaw - but Ebsworth's sneeze, in Tallboy, was any thing but natural convulsion •,
and Williams's whole performance of Dr, Bartolo was to the full as
remote from the humour of thatcharacter. It was mere vulgar wrath
and scold—downright hKrloi'Ara.moo-• such a representation, in fact,
.f the ludicrous jealousy and perplexity of the outwitted old Grlp-i*_
a . one of the Giants of Guildhall would be of Alexander the Great, or
I as We*tmaeot*s bombastic bronze, in Hyde Park, is of the classic
sublime of Achilles. Brough and Mrs. Garrick were decent in
Basil and Marcellina, The unspeaVahle absurdity, called Twelve
Precisely, which followed, gave Mr«-.ChatterIy, in Amelia Wildlore.
, an opportunity of displaying the versatility of her powers, and the
promptitude with which a lady, also, can change her outward sem.
blances from
top to toe, and sustain five different character.* (male
and female1 iu scarcely more than as many minutes. *fhe deceptions, however, outrage all probability, and Johnson, in
Sir Ferdinand Frisky, seemed resolved to be quite as remote
from aU semblance of nature. He appears to have no| conception of the difference between supporting a ridiculous
character, and being ridiculously out of all character. W. West's
Brau was in much better style. It is impossible not to observe that
this actors fort lies la the same line cf character with that of our old
favourite little Knight. Let him, however, he careful to avoid imitation of that original actor, and, by trusting to his own originality.
he may In time become his successor. The best of this farcies!
Twelve precisely, after all, is, that it is confined to one abort act. The
entertainment of the evening closed with this piece—though the
pertormance did not. It was followed by ane of the dullest, or silliest
abortions, in two acts, that perhaps ever came from the pen ot a
farce -writer—SpurnwA Bonds, or Wars in Wedlock, From whose brain
thi, half-formed crudity may have sprung, we know not, and, in
charity* we will not inquire: but it has neither plot, character.
nor incident; and the wft of the dialogue consists exclusively
of clenches, puns, and quibbles, which might have done, perhaps, for seasoning to such light food as farces are generally composed of, if there had been any thing like
nutriment or flavour in the principal ingredients themselves. But a
single specimen will serve to show that something was at aay rate
necessary as a substratum. Don-A Ivor Mr. Listen and Donnr^Alvara
(Mrs. Jones are in high contention whether Don Felix 'Vining), the
favoured lover of Clara • Mrs. Chatterly), should or should not be permitted to remain in the house. Each Is equally obstinate; and the
Don, although somehow or other he seems most miraculously to have
started from the warehouse into the rank and condition of a Spanish
Grandee, and in other parts of the dialogue to be unabls to leave the
shop behii.d him, resolves to show, at least, that he has been to
school, and learned his moods and tenses ; for he tells her. that a*
she has got into the positive, it i* necessary fur him to get into the
superlative, and (rive her a specimen of the subjunctive- He accordingly seizes her hands, to restrain her violence by main force- The
Donna struggles, and calls out lustily for assistance. " Ob ho f* cries
the Don," ** what, you are ia the vocative now, are you ? But if you
are determined to be in the imperative, 1 must show yon what I can do
in the potential; and grappling with her, most courageously b r
jumps her off the stage. Need we say what was the indicative of a j
this l—that it was most unsparingly hissed. The story, as far aa wt
could make head or tail of it, is merely this:—Don Alr.ar purposes to
give his daughter to her youthful lover, Felix - but his Donna, in the
true high epfritof matrimouialcontradiction, resolves that she shall
be the wife of a shambling shutting worn out old Grandee (very well
personified by little West)—a Don Julian, we believe, or some such
name—forthe noise of discontent frequently overpowered the utterance of the actors. In furtherance of her designs, she procures aletter
to be cent to her, accusing Don Felix of being already married- to
which, for the avowed reason that his wife appears to be confident in
the truth of its contents, Dun Alnar determines to give no kind of
credit. The pretended bride ..Mrs. Orger, is, however, produced in
full presence by the superannuated rival, with a miniature picture of
FeHm set in diamonds (which he had accidentally dropped in the

HA YMARKET THEA TRE.

Tli? P'-y °f t-16 Africans was performed at tkis theatre
yesterday evening for the first time this season ; and if the
managers will take our advice, it will be the last. We have
not seen so thin an attendance during the whole season ;
and we confess that in no instance have we been so little
entertained; and yet, to say the truth, we were quite as
much entertained as we expected ; for the actors in general did their best to give it something like interest. But
the play itself is one uf these muddling, maundering,
every-day, preternatural, hotch-potches which we never
see or think of without wonderinghow such heterogeneous
inanities could obtain or keep possession of the stage.—
T h e author seems to have culled a parcel of half-formed
slip-slop characters from the novels of the Minerva Press,
washed them in a weak solution of walnut shells, and then
palmed them upon us as Africans : and having -nixed them
u p with some sentimental monsters, benevolent slaughterers, and sympathising executioners, of more inky dye,
and stolen one of the dullest quibble clowns from a booth at
Batholomew fair (whom, nevertheless, we are informed Mr.
Eiston has the bad taste to be very fond of representing), and
thrown them into a variety of the most impossible situations
Gfthere be degrees of impossibility'), he makes them spout
together a collection of ethical common-places, most extravagantly out of place, with jokes that Joe Miller would
have blushed at, and new versions of Pope's Universal
Prayer; and this he calls a play. And this there are tome
play-goers who can sit patiently to hear and see. The
inanity of the effect was, however, sufficiently evident,
even upon the lovers of monstrosities and broad grins.
There was Some laughing of course, every now and then,
a t Listen's bad jokes: for there are some, and not a few,
in every audience, who laugh by instinct whenever Liston
shows his queer face, even in the superlatively dull and
silly character of Henry Angusins Mngg ; but we remember not one other single character of this humourist iu
•which the laughs appear to have so much of the cold lifelessness of mere habitude as in this. Save us, dear goddess
(if such goddess there be who would protect us from the
yawns of tedium), save us from the penalty of sitting
out another representation of Tlie Africans. Yet Mrs.
C . Jones's Sutta was as good as the thing could b e ;
Vining and Cooper did what could be done for Madiboo
and Seiko; and Mrs. Chatterley forced (in spite of the
author) so much of nature and interest into Berissa,
that we could not help wishing she had had something
better to do. In short, the actors in general (with
one or two exceptions) were' much better than the
enactment; the sauce better than the meat; and with
s uch a company as the manager of this theatre has assembled around him, he has nothing to do but, by judicious
selection, to avoid such feeble, trashy, and incongruous
dramas as this we are noticing—to secure the gratification
of his audience, and to himself a continuunce of what
•during almost the whole of the present season he has hitherto enjoyed—a thronged and highly respectable attendance. The play was succeeded by the two act eomedy of
Simpson and Co.. and the one-act farce of Twelve jr*cisely. But of these we have spoken already ; and *>all,
therefore, only add that they went off with their accustomed eclat.

HAYMARKET THEATRE.

Yesterday evening Sweethearts attd Wipes, .flfalch-mnAiM^, and A
Rowland for « t Glirer, were again performed here. And to judge by
appearances ;for the house was pretty well filled, and the audience,
for the time of the year, very elegant), these oft-repeated pieces
hare not lost much of their attraction. Madame Vestris indeed, is
missed in the first of these, and cannot fail to be so till a more ladylike substitute is found for her iu Laura than Miss Love. But we
know not whether we can say that she is so in the last, since her
character of Maria D'trlitigtim- is sustained by Hiss Pa ton. If this
young lady does not entirely equal her two fascinating predecessors
in the acting of the character, she is, even in this respect, very little
their inferior; and in the fine bravura song introduced by her in the
first scene, she more than compensated for whatever -«Mbt otherwise have been deficient iu the balance. The • • itself
Is very beautiful and gave Miss Faton full scop^Tor that
tasteful and brilliant execution, and that clear delicious shake
which constitutes the peculiar charm of her vocal exertions. The
symphony, which is particularly pleasing, gave promise of the
rich treat that was prepared for ufi; and we wexe nothing
di-appointed by the result. The repetition was called for by an enthusiastic and universal encore; and it improved upon us by reiteration- The applause was again so long continued, that it seemed almost like a demand for it a third time. The waltzing song, in the pretended mad .scene, was also executed with peculiar grace; and was
likewise loudly encored.and the performance altogether went off with
complete eclat , The character of Maria Varling-ton, indeed, appears
to be one of peculiarly happy (jestiaieic. It can rarely happen to a
little part like this, to have a rapid succession of three such representatives as Miss Foote, Madame Vestris, and Miss Paton Though
we have noticed it before, we cannot in justice pass by, without commebdation, Hammond's Fu-twre; which is certainly a capital piece of
acting, and «hows him to be, in his proper sphere, a performer of no
ordinary capabilities.

HAY MARKET.

1m.

We attended this house on Thursday night, to witness the second
representation of the revival of the Young Quaker. We had read in
the course of the afternoon the story of " Wake not the Dead," in the
newly t.-anslated Tales of the Northern Nations, and we never felt the
force of the title and moral of a fancy narrative more completely.
Was there a land of Absurdity, as well as of Cockaigne, O ' K E E F E

would have been a Fnnce in i t ; but then his was not the absurdity of
poverty of spirit and mereinanity, hut absolutef««, rich, joyous, and irresistibly laughable. The Young Quaker proves this fact, though one of the
worst, if not the very worst, of his five-act farces.

V I N I N C was the

Young Sadboy, and very passable, though not sufficiently steeped in
a sense of the unctions drollery of O ' K E E F E .

TERRY was the Old

Chronicle, and did what he could for so .silly a conception; but on
the male side the palm lay with LISTON and HARLEY, each of whom

was deliciously comic. As toLl.no*, he must never die—tbe world
cannot spare him. Miss CHESTER, in Dimilt Primrose, has no room
for display in any way; and then Aruminta is made so extremely ridiculous, wealmost got out of humour evenwith the ingenuous countenance
of Miss LOVE, beaming as it was with the assumption of disinterested

affection. About another repetition, and the ruting Quulur will be
on the shelf again. The reception was good-humoured, but the announcement produced no symptoms of an extraordinary wish to see
it again.
Simpson and Co. followed, with no material alteration of caste, except in the two wives, in which Miss CHESTER and Mrs. GIBBS
assumed the parts of Mrs. DAVISON and Mrs.Gt.ovEii. There was

nothing lost by the transfer in the first, and but little in the second
instance.

TERRY- was as much at home in Mincing-lane as ever;

and COOPER, in fine ecpiable spirits, represented the junior partner as
atDrury-lane. Every time we see this little piece, we are more and
more struck with its happy construction, and regard it as one of tbe
coippletest examples of minor drimatic art we ever witnessed. Q.

It i s , however, but fair to premise thot t h i s piece should have
been produced on Saturday, as e x p r e s s d in the hilte; since,
through this provoking d* lay, ajudieiaas and eqwitittte Critic, and
Contemporary, has, in consequence of an ardent desire to gratify
his Readers with early intelligence, b e e * led into a most mifotttinate m i s t a k e : we allude lo a review of the above, which a p peared in a publication of Sunday last, nud stated that t h e piectwas completely " d
•u'id" on t h e preceding evening. T h i s was
exu- ntcly unlucky in t h e Critic, as in very despite of bis prescience, when Fish out of Wuttr really did make its appearance, he
did iMl appear to be in his elemeut. as it received warm tokens of
aj--/>rooatu»i /
Of the piece itself, we must say that it is a platgartsm* and m>
very like a Bagatelle t h a t we have seen a t t h e Adelpki T-heatre
last season, that it*, claim to originality is quite owl of the question.
The Lover wishes lo engage himself as Secretary to the father
of his Mist, ess, who wants a Cook also. T h e Steward, who is to
engage the parties, mistakes tbe views of t h e applicants, ami employs t h e Cook as Secretary, a n d rice versa. Hence aiise t b e awkwardness and difficulties of situation ; and Liston, as Nwronry,
tbecoefc, (played by Ox berry at t h e Adtlphi), kept the house m
a continued roar. At the denovenunt, the lovers are, of course,
made happy ; and the piece was given out for repetition without
a dissentient voice.—We would advise our coo temporary-to* wail,
ui future, unlet a piece is performed before he
" Damns its insigniAeance t o all mteuts '

HAYMAKKET.

De mortals nil nisi bonum is an adage to be received with a few
grains of allowance, if people are to speak at all. On Friday evening
another farce was effectually condemned at this house, although suported by a passable plot, and LISTON for a hero. I t was called
V Great Unknown, and the idea turns upon a foolish craniologist
and novel-reading old maid being led to take a travelling dyer for the
author of the Scottish Novels; his appearance resembling the wellknown description of Dr. Dryasdust, and his mysterious secrecy in
relation to a chemical secret which he possesses, added to his talk about
his works, completely deceiving them. There was however no dialogue
and less point, except in a particular which modern purity will not
pass over. The old maid is alluding to literary works, and the supposed Unknown interprets it into a reference to a little troop of illegitimates, the fruits of his furtive gallantry. This and dulness were
quite unpardonable, and the " deep damnation" of the taking off the
Great Unknown, like that of Duncan, was rapid and final.
A fracas has happened at this house, between the management
and Miss PATON, who has absented herself from her engagement. Ill
health is the plea, but it is not according to the H ^ s s of things, that
a performer should be announced jour times a .«fpk for concerts in
Exeter, who has left London inconsequence of pleaded indisposition.

HAYMARKET

THEATRE.—A

new farce, entitled

The

Great Unknown (the designation which some of the reviews have applied to the northern novelist), was produced on Tuesday night. I t is excessively stupid, and
during several parts of the dialogue, there were strong
symptoms of disapprobation from the audience. I t has
not a single redeeming quality ; and is, in truth, a concentration of dulness and impertinence. So perfect a
contempt had Liston for the character of the Great Unknown, that he did not deem it necessary to commit his
part to memory. This is not right. The performer who
refuses a character is fined; and he who accepts of a part
ought to be doubly fined if he does not perfect himself

in it.

HO YM

The musical entertainment (farce they should call it—
for it sets all probability at defiance) ot My Grandmother,
placed Madame Vestris before us again in petticoats ; and
though the costume of My Grandmother does not exhibit
her person to the best advantage, yet we congratulate her
upon the absence of masculine attire, and would rather
see her in any kind of masquerade than that of .MoeA.?.rfA.
The public seem to be of the same taste, for her reception
in Florella was much more hearty, and the plaudit* beyond comparison more general than those of Wednesday
evening. Let her but keep in her proper sphere, and the
easy and graceful variety of her manner, her very pleasing
voice, the apparently instinctive spontaneity with which
1
her notes flow from her ; and, above all things, the sweet
j and audible clearness of her enunciation, whether in dialogue or song, are always sure to charm- In the part of
Florellu, indeed, she has little opportunity of exciting admiration, but from these constitutional endowments ; but
they were sufficient to give a zest even to a dramatic
trifle, whose plot (if plot it can be called) .turns upon no
better hinge than the incredible fatuity of a lover who
cannot discover the difference between his living mistress
in a frame, and a picture on the flat surface of a piece of A
varnished canvas. Her songs, and her duet with Leoni
Lee, the walking gentleman, or If'oodley of the night, is
though not encored, were applauded as they deserved, and
distinguished, as usual, by the pointed perfectness of her
enunciation. It is reaily extraordinary that, with such an
example before her, Miss Johnson should have continued
to perform the character of Charlotte in what, as far as
oral intelligibility is concerned, might be called pantomime.
But most certainly it did so happen t h a t " in the first place,"
and another succession of four equally unimportant particles, were all the syllables that came distinctly to our
ears in the whole of what should have been her part of the
dialogue. Vining's Vapour was, upon the whole, as
amusing as his success in characters where he had more
to do would have led us to expect. He has, however, one
fault, which he cannot be too expeditious in correcting.
Where the particular humour or infatuation of the character should excite in the spectator a sense of the absurd
or ludicrous, he is apt to show his own sense of that absurdity, and to make his manner a sort of beholder's or
narrator's comment, instead of preserving an apparent
unconsciousness of the fatuity. No man, it should be
remembered, whatever may be the foible of his character,
ever caricatures it himselt by a voluntary and purposed
burlesque. Hailey was as laughable as usual in Dicky
Gouip, and took care to let the farcical comicality of ita
four out* (the tailor, barber-dentist, apothecary, and undertaking carpenter, who ruti out, drawn out, leti out, and
lay* out) lose any part of the point which odd intonations
and odd twists and glances of the eye and features
could bestow upon them, either in dialogue or song. The
operatical comedy of Stceethearlt and Wive* regained all
its attractions by t h . return of the original Laura, snd
Liaton kept up his reputation for inimitable Inckadauicalneit in Billy; and" Shook the sides of the laughter-lovers,
a* he-etofore, by his Delph, in Family Jan.—The house
was -eil attended; and the dre«s-hoxes exhibited an enlivening display of beauty well adorned.

s-

The thiice-promised" musical Drama, The Vicar of
JVakefieid, was at lust presented at this Theatre, on Saturday evening, we cannot say with great eclat. It was announced as a first representation in its present form;
it having heretofore been performed as a Burletta, at the
Surrey Theatre, though now re-modelled and extended,
by Mr. Dibdin, into three acts. Perhaps, however, it
might not be unadeisable to revise it yet again, and reduce
it at least to the length of two ; for at present, it hangs
rather heavy. The fable and characters of the original
novel aie not as well adapted for the stage as for the
closet. The rusticated pious simplicity of Dr. Primrose
reads better than it acts. Enough of the character to
make its moral beauty discernible would be more than
could be consistent with scenic effect. And as for Lady
Blarney and the Honourable Mis* Carolina Ifflhclmina
Amelia Skegs, if they were exhibited in all their proper
colours on the stage, they w.uld scarcely be endured.
And then the story of Olivia's seduction has been forestalled in recent representations; and as it is here
managed, falls but flatly into comparison with that of
Cluri. The author has added but little that can atone for
what was anti-dramatic in the original materials. Liston
has little that is very happily adapted to his vein in Moses
Primrose; and Hammond certainly nothing in Jenkins for
the manifestation of his. And although nothing could be
more beautifully natural than the sprightliness of the
early scenes of Miss Chester's Olivia, except the pathos
of those that follow, yet enough is not given to the cha<racter to make it, even in her hands, very effective. Terry
was very respectable in Dr. Piimroie, and the pathetic
passages in the scenes after the elopement of his daughi / i i «
' ter, and in that where he encounters her in her distress
and penitence, were given with the touching truth of na, ture. But the meek and modest, yet dignified simplicity
of tne Vicar is not exactly in Terry's way.
Of Davis's;
Ensign Primrose, we shall only say that its reception may
help to conrince him. as his performance did the. audience,
that neither as an actor, nor as a singer, are his powers
adapted for the stage.
Leoni Lee, in Farmer William*, appeared, as usual, self-satisfied enough; and
probably the satisfaction was all his own. Of Johnson's
gentlemaiuhip our opinion has been delivered often
enough to render any criticism of his 'Squire Thornhill superfluous. W. West's French lacquey was much
' mure ttappy. Jf k . I....M •-.•.. rid of h i . plump, hearty,
English rustic look, be would be excellent in this
line of character. Cooper's Burchell (Sir William Thornhill) was all that it could be. Miss Johnson, in Aurelia,
manifested considerable improvement in point of clearness
and audibility of enunciation, but her timidity and agitation appear to be insurmountable ; and in her song they
so overpowered her, that it is only by candid conjecture
that we can sustain the favourable opinion we have formed
f tJ}iJO& HI W ' of the capabilities of her voice. Mrs. Garrick is certainly
in no point of view an adequate representation of Sophia.
But Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Orger hit off the vulgar affectation of dissipated high fashion to the life, in the supposititious Lady Blarney and the Hon. Mist Carolina IP'ilhelmina
Amelia, &c. The latter burst upon us, as it were, twenty
thousand strong, in an unexpected quarter. Who would
have expected from Mrs. Orger a caricatura bravura in a
stile thkt should (ommand peals of laughter, admiration,
plaudit, and an encore? Her Sunday Concert was, however, by far the most striking feature of the piece, and
certainly the only thing, in the way of song, that contributed in any degree to the attraction of the performance.
Her heroics, her affetuoso, her trills, and her chromatics, and her alternate self-accompaniments through allthe instruments of the band, from the hurdy-gurdy to the
flute, from the castinet to the kettle drum, w e r . in high
zest j but her Savoyard was imitation inimitable. Her
voice, perhaps, would not have power to produce the
same effect on the larger theatres; but here it was efficient. The piece was patiently heard to the end ; but at
the fall of tne curtain there was a good deal of hissing,
ani. .he announcement for repetition on Tuesday, met -vith
considerable opposition. The ayes, however, had it.

Ail tiiat we can report upon this subject is, that though
we were at the doors before the time appointed for the
commencement of the performance, we could not gain
admittance. The house was already full to overflow,
and the door-keepers were turning away money by
wholesale, and as we had neglected to take places, ours
was turned away also. The disappointment to us was not
reat: for the Billy Lackaday, Tristram Sappy, and Neddy
Way, formed a triune attraction, even without the bonus of
Lord Grizzle on an Ass, yet we thought it probable that
all together might be too much of a good thing; and it
was probably a providential mercy to our poor sides,
which, when shaken too long and too violently, might be
in danger of spasm, that we could not obtain admittance.
In sober phrase, it was in compliment merely to a merry
favourite, who has so frequently enabled us to laugh away
the spleen, that we were desirous of being present on this
occasion ; for otherwise the Assine exhibition would have
been the very reverse of an attraction. For a Theatre
Royal, at least, we deem such an addition to the dramatis
personae rather outre—a. grin somewhat too broad: and
we cannot but think that Mr. Listen has a talent and a
fund of humour sufficient of his own to make us laugh
quite as much as it can be pleasant to laugh, without
sharing his honours with an ass. But Shuter had set
the example, in a former generation, of addressing the
public from the back of Baalam's long-eared steed, and all
who tread in his path of course must mount his hobby.
We rejoice, however, to find that, whatever were the
sources of attraction, the benefit of so deserving a favourite
of the play-going public was so attended, as to render
criticism impertinent and praise unnecessary.

HAYMARXET.

Madame Vestris has done so much more than we had
looked for as a comic actress, during the present season,
at this house, that w.? could not resist the temptation of
seeing what she would do with the arduous character of
Letitia Hardy, in Mrs. Cowley's very pleasing comedy of
the Belle't Stratagem, performed here for the first time
ytsterday evening; and we confess that our expectations
were more than realized. In the masquerade scene—indeed, in many respects, the most arduous, we expected her
to shine, aa she did shine, beyond any representative of
the character we have happened to see for several years.—
In song and dance, and that something more than
mere English grace and vivacity assumed to ensnare the
heart of her travelled lover, we knew she would be at
home; but these, though the most striking, are not the
only requisites for the adequate representation of Letitia.
It is a character of great variety, and demands a versatility
which does not often fall within the scope of performers
familiar with the first line of comic character. Of this
versatility we found, we confess, an unexpected display.
It would be too much to say that the performance was perfect. In the more quiet parts of the first scene, in particular, we thought her movements not sufficiently characteristic of that quiet ease and tempered gracefalness which
distinguishes tH* well-bred English gentlewoman from
what we call the iceman of fashion, or fine lady ; and in the
more serious parts of the dialogue her utterance (distinct
and clear, as it always is) lost a part of its impressiveness
by the error of letting the ends of her sentences run off
too rapidly. There are some parts of this character in
which this defects is more than ordinarily unfortunate ; and though the pracl ice is but too common on the
stage, an accurate observation of the usual process
of spontaneous utterance would show it to be so directly
contrary to the usage and impulse of nature, that the judicious performer would be solicitous to correct it.
Bating these and some smaller deficiencies, however,
Madame Vestris's Letitia was spirited and fascinating.
The affected hoydenishness with which she
designedly disgusts her provokiugly indifferent lover
was admirably sustained—sustained indeed as a characteristic assumed; and in such a manner, that the observation of Dorriconrt on the intelligence stealing occasionally
from her eye, which seemed to reproach the rusticity and
ignorance produced l.y an erroneous and neglected education, told home as a sort of inferred compliment to the
discriminating fidelity of the actress. Nor were the variad
expressions of mortification before the formation of her
stratagem, of lively confidence in the anticipation of its
success, of triumphant satisfaction in its progress, or of
emotion when removing her mask in the catastrophe, less
happily conceived. It is no small praise, that in all this
variety nothing was caricatured, or pushed beyond the
modesty of nature. The fault was on the more excusable
side. There were parts to which, when she shall become
more familiar with the character, she will undoubtedly give somewhat of a higher colouring.
The Hoyden song, fVKere are you going my pretty maid ?
was executed with an admirable affectation of rustic coquetry and naivete, and was loudly encored; but in the
Italian song Di placer (from La Huzza Ladra), introduced
in the masquerade scene, she outdid herself; and the
encore—which, in spite of the compassion of part of the
audience for the extra exertion imposed by it, was vehemently insisted upon—was, as usual, given with still increased effect. We were somewhat surprised at the visible
agitation of this lady at the commencement of the Minuet
de la Cour, which, however, sheexecuted with much grace
and spirit, in spite of the orchestra, to which she found it
necessary at one time audibly to intimate that they were
playing wrong, and at another, even to pause till they had
tried to set themselves right. The eclat of this performance (as far as Madame vestris was concerned) will undoubtedly occasion its repetition, in which case we should
be glad if at least a m o r , youthful SavilU than Mr.Younger
could be found, and if so meritorious an actor as Hammond
could be excused from being so out of his place as he appears in the character of Courtall. Cooper's Dorrieourt was
more than respectable; Terry's Hardy was characteristically
humorous; and vining's Flutter (though more might certainly be made of the character) was reputably amusing. But
Johnson's Sir Geo. Touchwood!—Surely this actor should
be able to perceive that coxcombry and affectation are
neither any traits of this character, nor very consistent
with that mechanical stiffness in the motion of the arms
and squared elbows, with which he is so fond of accompanying a dandy mispronunciation of the King's English.
One merit, however, this actor has—every syllable he has
to pronounce is always distinctly heard; and this is something in a play in which, like this, the lane-u.iflr.-i. •,•'•,•
hearing. We have seen so little of Mrs W, Clifford this
season that we ought not to omit the opportunity of saying
that her Mr*. Racket was lively and respectable , but we
should be obliged to Miss Wood, when next she performs
the character of Siiu Ogle, if she would enable us to understand, at least, some part of her small share of the •
dialo<rue. The house (notwithstanding the imposing i
of two winter Theatres) was very respectably at-

HAYMARKET

THEATRE.

TTO HHHW T8AJ.

Ui

Tobin's pleasant comedy, (or dramatic cento of beautiful parodies from Shakspeare, and the olden poets), the
Honey Mom,, was performed on Saturday evening for the
h i HC
benefit of Mr. Davis; the part of Juliana by Mrs. Davis,
*K»<3& , !>0«* i-*.-'
late Miss Dance—her only appearance at this theatre.—
The announcement produced, though not absolutely a
crowded, a very respectable attendance ; and the dress
circle, in particular, had a more than usual display of elegance. It will be remembered that about two years ago m~— —*• yr-nn-o.--*-tr- raaaR.ni.
Miss Dance made her debut on the Covent Garden boards
in the character of Mn. Hatter, and was very favourably received. The beauty of her person, the
expressive eharm of her features, and, above .11,
a certain air of accomplished grace aud elegante in
her deportment, had undoubtedly much to do in
the favourable impression that resulted. But the perforaiance in itself was considerably above mediocrity; and, but
v-di I
WiHK
for the recent remembrance of the transcendent excellence
of Miss O'Neil in this her very best character, it m'yht,
perhaps, have stamped the reputation of this young )ady
as an actress of more than ordinary promise. ' Her afterperformances, however, did not secure her an eligible engagement at that house; and the respectability of her
connections precluding the ordinary recourses of a priibationary circu.t through the provincial theatres, or a gradual progress o 1 through subordinate and secondary characI
,iM
,n.
ters, she retired again into the happier sphere of domestic
f
privacy. The occasion of her stepping forward again be,0b i«loH
fore the public can require no apology ; and her performance stood in need of very little of that indulgence to
which the description of audience usually assembled on a
.-M
benefit night is naturally disposed. It was, indeed, a
1 .1
beautiful and happy delineation of the haughty, capricious,
and assuming, but ultimately subdued and affectionately
amiable Juliana; and though there were a few passages
which seemed to require the sustainment of rather more
physical power than the voice and management of this
lady seemed capable of commanding, there was not more
even of this deficiency than a moderate share of practice
might be reasonably expected to surmount. Her emotions at her first entry were such as if it had been an actual debut, and such as to render her incapable for seme
minutes either to speak or stand ; yet it was evident t lat
they never deprived her of her complete conception of the
character ; and as she gradually recovered from her agitation, she gave a vital reality to that conception which
merited the general plaudits with which it was received.
The varied and progressive feelings of imperious assumption, of impetuous srorn and acrimony at the discovery of
her supposed humiliation, of sullen and smothered discontent, of dissembled first, and afterwards unfeigned, submission, and ultimately of fond, confiding tenderness and
affection, have seldom been more happily represented by
a set of beautiful and finely expressive features. The impetuous loquauty before the imagined Duke—the manner in which she threw down the chair she was ordered
to bring for the peasant Lopez in her bumble cottage, and
checked herself into subdued quietness when about to
treat in the same manner that which she had brought for
her husband—the apparent gradual melting of the heart
till sullenness was progressively metamorphosed iuto an
involuntary and delicious smile, during Aranza't beautitul
description of the simple dress in which her charms are
to be displayed at the rustic merriment—her deportment
at the dance of her rustic partner, and the clinging, as it
. were, of her growing affections to her husband as she occasionally passes him in the evolutions of the group,
might be selected from a number of other instances in
which the actress coloured her accurate conception of the
character with all the truth of nature ; and in trie by-play,
for which she could only have consul ed her own imagiI nation, she was to the full as happy, as in the delivery of
what was set down to her in the text, or in the application of what could be dictated by stage direction. If
in the song at the commencement of the fifth
act Mrs. Davis displayed more of taste and musical
science than of vocal power, her movements in the dance
had a graceful and booyant elegance that justified her
claim to the station in which Juliana, after all her trials,
was to find herself ultimately plueed. Nor was the effect
of this marred by the little accident of the awkward foot
of her partner, as, at the end of the dance, she pushed him
away to fly to her husband, bitching in the flounce of her
petticoat, and tparing it almost completely off. Cooper
sustained the character of the Duke withjudicious firmness
and equanimity; Vining was sprightly in Rolando;
Mrs. W. Clifford played Volante better than she looked i t ;
. 1 1i
and Liston, as usual, was irresistibly laughable in Jaquet.
Of the other characters it is kindness not to speak. The
mutilated Reggar't Opera succeeded; and Mr. Davis performed Macheath. But glad as we were to see
at any rate a man in this character, we feel
obliged to repeat t h . sentence we have heretofore pronounced, that neither the voice nor the
acting of Mr. Davis qualify him for success on the London
uoardi, how much admired soever he may be in the social
ind convivial circle. Between the two pieces Madame
*-stris sung " In infancy our h.p«s and feais" very de•igfefuHy, and was rapturously encored.

The .following address was on Wednesday night spoken by Mr. T.

of the season : —
W/ /
** Ladies nod Gentlemen,—I have the honour of appearing before you
w t h e representative of the proprietors of this theatre,, to nun 11
yoti, that with the performances of this evening their season will . e m u l a t e : and to offer ^<Tti their very sincere thanks for
lity with
von hnve rewart^d their efforts to deserve yotn favour. These,
M r i h e y have been unremitting, so have they been siiqcessful beyond their
a inguine expectations. T h e seasons of thi.
ire nt-eessanlv
I but in proportion as they are short, the proprietors are desiroum of
tendering them attractive. Tl
larger and graver rivals,
the weightier pares of the tragic drama, happy if they can add to your
stock of innocent enjoyment, and promote good humour, paiety, and
laughter. Of the dramatic no
ii th'-y have prodoced (or yoor
amusement, the greater proportion you have honoured with a share of
approbation nearly unprecedented; and, ever obedient if
and confident in the justice of your decisions, they have instantly and
unhesitatingly withdrawn such productions as have !
iin your
sanction. W i t h regard to the performers, the earnest wishwfl
prietors has been to collect a company in sonic degree worthy of the
distinguished patrouage with which 11 us theatre has nt all time.

THIATIE.—The

Hsymarket

Theatre

opened last night for the season, with the Opera of The Lord of,
the Manor, preceded by a new one-act farce, called Come i / j
lyo. con. Cowe if you can is not likely, we apprehend, to be
repeated. The chief aim of the affair seems to have been to introduce Mr. Wilkinson, (from the Adelphi Theatre,) in the
dress of an old woman. I t is not very easy to get damned at a
summer theatre; but the author, whoever he may be, succeeded
most unequivocally. Madame Vestris and Mr. Liston were seen
with great pleasure in T/ie Lord of the Manor. M r . vining, and
-Mr. West, and several other last year's performers, were seen too.
In the musical way, there were two •' first appearances"—a M r .
Huckel, and a Mr. Melrose. M r . Huckel (who played the part of
Rashly) showed talent at the San. Pareil Theatre some yeareago, in
Yorkshire characters; but he has very little qualification in the way
of a leading singer. Mr. Melrose is a gentleman who appeared a
season or two ago at Drury-lane. He seems to need tuition very
generally, and we can scarcely congratulate him on his success.
In a minor degree, there were one or two other debutants, who, as
the phrase is, •' exerted themselves to the u t m o s t ; " and their restive friends in the front of the house were not behindhand with
•a.em in activity. The entertahiments of the evening concluded with
the farce called Fish out of Water; but the strength of the Havmarket company is not yet in operation, nor can it be, indeed, while
the patent theatres continue open. It is pity that some arrangement
should not be entered into, which would put an end to these differences between the winter and summer theatrical establishments. '
Both sides must be losers by the contention. I n particular, the pa
tent houses (under the heavy charge at which thev stand) cannot
be likely to derive much benefit from keeping open throughout the
year.

THEATRE.

A new f.rce (with a strange tille) Wd. produced at this theatre last
night, tallied A Year in an If our; or, The Cock of the Walk. The
i Haymarket has not been fortunate hitherto in its selection of no-elI ties thi. season : their lirstniirht'e piece was a failure, and the ..resent '
. it not much better. The Year in an Hour occupies ivro short acts,
' which havelittle reasonable connexion with each other; and, indeed, I
put of the joke intended it, that twelve months are supposed to
I eiapte between them. In the that act, Sir. Liston, who it an .
j ugly gentleman in a country village, gets a wife, and becomes
: Cock of the walk, in consequence of all the other male inha'>i tants
! being taken away. In the second act wefindhim married and pot.
.eased sf a child, to which he carries sttga-.pluins; and farther, he
I become*) jealous of his wife, out of circumstances almost as probable
} as those which led to his obtaining her. Mr. Liston is the only
, person who has any thing ia the piece approaching to a character : j
| and his opportunity it limitted, pretty nearly,to the right of uttering t
common-place dialogue with the best face that he can truster. The '
: farce, on the whole, is decidedly one of the silliest affaire th.it we I
i have teen ; and half the audience left the house before its conclusion. I,

under the "title of Married an3 Single,

bounty of his uncle, strives to conoeil his embarrassttienttr,'
from him. T h a t , however, cannot be ; the harpies A
of the law are abroad, who lay a snare for their victim
by a trumoed up story of • coach with two ladies bring
awaiting him at the door. The uncle is mistaken for
the nephew; be chuckles at so fair an occasion of iittrigiie

T h e piece, however, as a whole, is entitled to great; approbation. I t ;stotally free of thos» raelo-draraatic turns
which act like miblrew on the modern dramas ; it trie*
to approximate to the standard of the old sterli n g comedy ;
M
and the attempt, though not entirely snucesful, (for, truth
to say, the muse is capricious) gives us promise of better A 1
things. The dialogue, though not positively witty, is
lively, piquant, and jocular ; and the character.., purticuif.5*> ' -%l,"i la"'y that of the Beau, are in very just keeping. Farren B iol) jfii.w sbt boon o f
gave full scope to his comic powers in the Old Rakt,
and the most flattering applause rewarded bis exertions. Cooper, in the graceless nephew, would have
been |morc agreeable had he not laughed so frequently. •sJBL A.JkK_fi .*.•for risibility does not at all become bim. The other

IIAYJk

A comedy in three acu, called Married and Single, was la,t nit.hr
produced at this theatre. It is a translation of a French »;ece '*" "-"
which, under the tick of I.'Homme a Soixante Am, has had 2.
great run at the Theatre de> Variitit, where.it is now acting. 1 lie
adaptation to the English stage has been executed by Air. Poole
with great ingenuity and good taste. T h e whole business of the r
plsy arises out ot'the efforts made by Mr. Shatterly (W'. Fan-en) to
keep up the character of a dashing young fellow after he has attain.
ed the ripe age of 60. H i s nephew, Mr. Melford (< ooper), a por.
trait-painter, is about to be marred, hut hss unluckily incurred a
debt of 2001., which he has no means of paying, an J which he dares -',
not communicate to his uncle. A n ingenisus attorney's clerk lays a
plan for arresting the young painter by sending him word that
two ladies are waiting for him at the door in a coach.
Mr.
Shattcrly's
servant, Scamper (Vining), overbears this plan,
and puts Melford on his guard. Mr. Shatterly pays h s nephew a .
visit, and the latter having quitted the room for a few minutes, the "
uncle takes up his palette, which he is holding when the attorney "
enters. He delivers his traitorous message to the uncle, who, delighted at the prospect of carrying off his nephew's mistress, an- .
nounces himself as Mr. Melford, and our ci-devant Jettne hvmme,
hoping that he shall have the credit of rivalling his nephew, runs hi*
head into the trap, and finds, when it is too late, that the blushing .
beauties in the coach are two stout bailiffs. It is in vain for him
to reiist them, or to deny that he is Mr. Melford: he is carried to a
spunging-house, and left there to pass his melancholy hours, while
a party of guests, whom he has invited to h's own bouse, are d e vouring his nipper, and abusing him for not being at home to do t h e
honours of his house. He is ashamed to send to h i ' friends, because
that would disclose his own folly, and he confesses one feature of
bis character to be, that he would rather be shot at than
laughed at.
A t length the debt is paid as for Mclfori '
by a Mrs. Waddy, who is indebted to Mr. Shatterly;
and
the old genueman reaches his own house just at the end ef
the evening's entertainment, accompanied bj- the young attor.1
ney, who will not leave him until he has received the fcalanceof,' b ( 5 8
interest and costs. While Mr. Shatterly is gone to fetch this money, the real Mr. Melford falls in with the attorney, and is so much
frightened at discovering who he is, that he decamps. A nother of
the consequences of the uncle having taken the place of the nephew
is, that the mistress of the latter seeing him receive a letter,in winch
the fact of Afr». Waddy having paid the debt is mentioned, becomes •
violently jealous; she afterwards sends to him, invitiBg him to take
a corner in the coach with herself and her sister, ."»ut the terrified
debtor, fancying it is the bailiff's trick, sends a note iJ". reply, which
the ladies mistake for an affront, and the breach between the lovers
is thus widened. Mr. S / W t W / s misfortunes do not end with the
payment of his nephew*, debts. H e is both married ant? single:
for while he is leading the life of a gay bachelor in London, .he has
a wife at Kensington, who is not disposed to bear things qu.'etly.
She comes to town ; other mistakes occur, which are tedious to u*..1,
but pleasant enough to see ; and in the end, Mr. Shatterly N
story being known to his friends, they compel him, through
his dread of ridicule, to forgive his nephew, who is alrendy"
forgives by his mistress, and to promise to live as becomes . .
his years with his own lawful wedded wife. There is little plot, "
\J
as may be guessed by the sketch we have given: the main incident
is i hat of the uncle's being arrested instead of the nephew, and Far.
rer.'s i», in point of fact, the oniy character in the piece. T h e manner of his acting was very excellent: he described in the most faithful and amusing manner the vain labours of elderly young gentlemen to get a reputation for irregularities which they cannot commit,
and which, if they could, would be the death of them. T h e contrast between his appearance in the first scene, just after his getting
.
up, and the next, in which his body and his spirits are screwed upCy
J
for the exertions of the day, was distinctly and admirably marked,, ,
.
and he took care not to confound Mr. Shatterly with Lord Ogleby, O ti
or any of those other characters to which it may be said to bear gome
t ;

external resemblance. The characters of Mr. and Mrt.
Bickerlon
(Mr. Pope and Mrs. Olover) have very little to do with the comedy, '
but are cleverly drawn. They form one of those matrimonial couples which abound where both parties brag of their felicity
and good temper, and whose lives are, nevertheless, a rapid succession of loving and quarrelling, of storm and sunshine. M r s .
Olover did much more and much better for the part than the
author had done: but Mr. Pope made matters even, for be forgot
what was set down for him. 31 is. C Jones played Mrs. Shatterly
like a woman of proper spirit—that is to say, in a manner which
incautious people would say bordered upon the termagant. M r .
Cooper is always bad in comedy : if he would ever bope to make an i
audience laugh, he should never try to laugh himself, for his a t tempts are as painful as can be imagined. Mr. Vining hod the good
fortune to play an active footman, and he did it in a manner that
showed him worthy of his destiny. The greatest merit of M r .
West, as the slender attorney, was. that he had carefully studied and
successfully imitated Cruickshank s driwing of Mr. Jones, in Peter $
Sehlemilh. T h e whole representation was clever ; bat the comedy- I
(if that which is only a farce.and which ought to be in two acts, mu-t
be called a comedy) is mainly indebted for its success to Farren's
acting. T h e dialogue is neat and lively, and although not remarkable
for its wit, it abounds in that light joking which people are glad to '
get since wit became scarce. It was received with universid and merited applause, and its announcement for repetition was received,
with the most unequivocal approbation of the audience.

HAY MARKET

THEATRE.

,st;i-«idifid

The Marriage of Figaro was played last evening at this theatre
for the lint time in the present season. Although the lame of
nearly half a century has stripped the drama of that powerful in.
terest which it once pom .wed, and successive translation* and altera.
tions hare divested it of that stinging satire which consigned
BeaumarcHais to the prison of St. Eazare, it hi still entitled, shorn as
it is, to the first rank of light comedy. The music of Mozart's
•fry•
opera, some of which la introduced into our modern version of La '
Folk Journie, helps it to keep its place In our theatres. For the
sake of that music, no leas than for the merit of the d rama, we wish
that it had fallen into better hands than were selected to perform it
at the Haymarket. Miss Paton's Susanna is not, perhaps, her |
happiest character: it requires rather more acting than she
U able to give it; and although she executed the songs in a
very agreeable manner, she was deficient in the other and
scarcely inferior requisites for the part. Unfavourable as a com- *
parison with some other actresses might be for Miss Paton, she wa» ,
".* ' f f H O i N i - O T
on this occasion, at least, jay fortunate in those with whom she
"
,.
'
played. That .Susanna must be bad, indeed, who would not ahiae .
8 3 vJHl
flO
brilliantly beside such a Countess as Mrs. Oarriek. Mrs. C Jones
can play Mrt. BtU delightfully ; bat for Barbarintf, herfigureand
her years are equally unsuited. The part which was best filled waa
l . .f
that of Cherutnuo. Rating that Mrs. Chatterly is a little too knowing
for the youthful and amorous page, she was quite excellent. Iiiston 'a
Figaro, to be better, should be more intellectual. It is very well,
but no more like the tea! Figaro, than it is like the Ghost in Hamlet. Mr. Wilkinson played Antonio, for the first time; and by an
odd mistake, of which he did not seem to be conscious, he repeated
the words of the Gardener's part, while he acted that of Geofrey
Mufflncap. The inferior characters were ill played; and upon the
whole, tht Opera was done worse than we ever before remember to
ha-e asen it at this theatre.

WAVMARKRT
THRATRF.
Mr. Kenny'.new
opera, which has
been so long expected, w

a"-k

last night brought out here. The story, a. the title of the play J**-,
"uiblA
( The AlcaidjnaA sufficiently announced, is Spanish, and the plot , •', •
is as much complicated as if it had been constructed by one of the old.
Spanish dramatists, instead of one of the beat and liveliest of those of
our own day. W e cannot but think that is no less unlucky for M r.
Kenny than for the audience, and we believe, that if far leas pains
had been bestowed on a more familiar subject, and in painting manners more like these which now exist, they would have told much
butter. Nobody cares for Alcaids, and Alguaiils, and brown
mantles, and black masks and serenades, and all the-time-out-efn.ind contrivances of Spanish comedies, unless they have something
better to back them. The plot is so involved, that it i» difficult
to comprehend it in the action, and, of course, the attempt
to describe it must be infinitely more so. The personage who
gives the name to the piece is the chief magistrate of a city
of Spain. He is, although a man high in office, a most
notable fool, aad this part of his character is particularly well
known to h i . wife (Mrs. Glover), his niece (Mis* Paton), his son
(M vlarae Veslris), and nis servants (Li-ton and Harley_t. He has"
a propensity to interfere with every body's business, and in the plenitude of his wisdom, fancies even the most minute affairs of all the
inhabitants of the city are known >o him, while he is the dupe of
every one about him. His son affects to set out for Salamanca to
complete h i . studies, while, in truth, he stays at home to finish a
course of natural philosophy, which he has begun by serenading an
<>ct-|r*i..H Donna Fitmceeca (Mrs. Garrick). His wife and niece
pretend to go to bed, bat really go to a masquerade. His servant
i 11
Jabez (Haney) promises to obey his injunctions not to speak to a
wc-nan, and by way of keeping his promise gets married. H i s
Aubiltems, Grigmio tnijuan (Williams and Latham),in whomhe / / ;f l/[ rfn ft
confides, plot to deprive him of his .ffice ; and his most faithful
secretary, e/dnMO (Liston),.takes bribes fr»m every member of his
Q
,$
I family to help their several intrigues against his wittol of a master.
The designs of all these factions, each different in itself, but all
tending to the same end, Droduce .some very odd situations, in which, |
and in the means adopted*by the aacpit Pedro*, tt.extricate the intriguer* when they are on the point of it 'ection, aU the force of the
comedy consists. These situation, are m K e >ng-i"o-» •"*-• they
are either striking or comic; and they are so numerous, that tt.ey
crowd the play often to t i e perplexity of the sn-i..' n c e - .*?*" more
>
often to the injury of the dialogue. I t would be iroJs. ,SMb . l 'j .*"* Ae'
fa
scribe them all within any reasonable compass, and it wnv
Vj;>. "
sier to write the play over again to make them ir.tell.gibk'.
"'
however, serve to Carry the business of the play to the (t.-.k'"''"
TO'-f, where the young people are married according fo l o t . . r
desire, and the A lea Id remains as great a fool as eve,..
Farren made this magistrate, as the author intended, a very imbecile| old man ; and, as we suppose the author did not intend, very l i k e
\.Justice Woodcock, in every thing but the Spanish habit. Mr...
| Glover made just mich a wife as such a husband might be expected
J to have. Miss Paton. as his tiece, sang very delightfully, was fre- " —'
quently and deservedly encored, arid particularly applauded in her
last song, ** Vouth in ardour proud i she had nothing at nil to act.
Madame Vestris made a dapper Don Felii ; axd although she was
sufficiently unlike s -tu.ie.it of Salamanca, yet, as she sung better
than any male the csi-tblishment could produce, one must be content. Idston's part, which is the best in the piece, was very carefully and cleverly acted: there is no man upon the stage who tells a •• '
Me and lakes a bribe with a better countenance than M r . Liston.
Harley's character is that of a very foolish footman, who is married ;
the materials are rather scanty, but his humour and talent eke them
out most amusingly. He sings a song in the Lnckaday style, but
hardly so good. Jaln't
oft en-repeated exclamation, " I can't
help thinking of my wife," from the universality of its application, is perhaps destined to very extensive popularity.
Mrs.
Gibbs, as the wife of Jahez, has very little to do, and it would not
hurt the play if that little were made less. T h e passport scene is
rather tootrross. Miss I.ove being affected with one of those throats o'f 131 -.1. .-M
to which since-, are so often subject when they have new parts, Mrs.
Garrick placed it for her, at a very short notice. A . apology was
-M.ofl
made f r this, which seemed hardly necessary, as the audience lost
only one song by the exchange. Mrs. C. Jones sang a pretty
song. T h e otner parts were all very sufficiently ffiled. W e think
it very likely that some alterations will be made in the play after the
trial of acting it, which, even to experienced hands, is the only test
of its strengtli,and we think that it may be amended. Its chief fault is
the complication of the plot- There is 'a dance in the third act, whi-.i
could be spared, because, although it is just of that sort in which
one might like to join, it is the most trifle affaire in t h f
' "•
• '"
world to look at. T h e music oi the opera is composed by M r . N a than ; and without being very good or very new, is well adapted for
-»«-.«
the purpose to which it is applied. It would be a little dangerous
to say any thing against it, for we could hardly blame Mr. Nathan
without striking at tome of those old and deserved favourites cf whose
assistance he lias so liberally availed himself, and behind who.m he
is so safely ensconced. The house was crowded ; and the play very
, t ) 3d t ) i '
favourably received.

T h e y o u n g U d y w h o m a d e h e r dtbut last week as Polly
in the loom of Alia., ratou, appeared tor the finst time under circum..tuner, MJ very unusual and eiTiba.Ta.«-Jng, that we think it due lo
her to make item publi.:. On the evening of performance, at halfpast si a. a certificate from Mits Psion's medical attendant Was handed to the manager, stating, that iu consequence ol a midden and severe ii.di-po..u.on aha wo.ild be utterly indelible of going through
her part that evening. Th»«, as BUty be ..uppoaed, created at so lale
»n hour great enibarra.*ainent and perplexity, and Air. Atorri
somewhat at a loss in selecting true of the theatrical corps to pei
the part; when hearing That thin young lady * J J actually in die
theatre, where she attended with a view of profiting by Mi.-s Paton's
performance (having studied the part a h e a d , with a theatrical view),
sent a nte.ki.ige to her enireaung that siae would oblige him »o i'^r as
to tssasent to supply the want of Miss Pafu.. With much goodnature she consented, a n l under these circumstances, which reflect
much credit on her talent, and readiness to Obl.gc, her first appearance on any stage was accomplished. Her performance and voice
highly gratified a numerous eudience, and her success was so great
M to occasion the repemion of the part by her last Friday evening.
when we attended for the purpose of estimating her abilities. •'> >

c.
East evening the comedy of

,id,

THEATRE.

The Busy Body was presented to a
very thinly attended house. Whatever was the charm in Mrs. Cent,
livre's writings which made her mu»e predominate over Congreve, it
no longer works. For what reason they keep the stage, except it be
to prove that the manners of our age are not more-corrupt than theirs,
perhaps no one besides the manager can tell. The plays have no beauty, either of thought or expression, to recommend them. The old
men are lewdand greedy—tneyoung ones, sensualists, who scorn to put
themselves to the trouble of metaphor or circumlocution to suggest
proposals not at all equivocal. The ladies, too, proceed with a
degree of warmth and candour which is hardly justified even
by the rigours of unjust guardian... And then, for language
and manners—what would be thought in our times of the
briisquerie of that hero, who would justify to a woman of quality the use of a little amorous intercourse with her before his
own marriage, by the delicate allusion of a cup of coffee before
dinner ? But still more, what would become of the play, if new,
in which the heroine should listen to so polite a surmise, and afterwards accept the swain in wedlock ? Miss Chester became the part
.
of Miranda, so far as youth and passioa were concerned; but she
was actually too much for it in intellect. The low and prurient tendency of the dialogue disagreed with her elegance and graceful
mirth, Her talent lies in a more elevated region »f comedy, the
powers of which she has considerably at command, though her style
wants fulness and emphasis, and her features are deficient in
flexibility. Mr. vining, as Sir George Airy (what a recondite
name to express a young man of fashion!) went through his part
with credit to himself. He displayed much ease and animation,and
seems to bring into the business a degree of understanding, which,
if seriously applied to his. own improvement, will make him considerable in genteel comedy. Mr.. Farrtj was sir Fraticit Gripe.
His genius, within a limited range of characters, acts with vigour.
I There is, however, no mellowness in his humour, and he neglects the
thin coating of good nature and good fellowship which nature herself suggests to hardened hypocrites as the propercst guise for th.ir
sordid purposes. In this particular he will never match either of those
two champions—Munden or Dowton. Mr. Harley's Marplot was
the great source of diversion—not for the prevailing excellence
—- " — - of the acting over that of the persons mentioned before. On the contrary, though a very taking and ludicrous performer, he is always at
i d 3 < J I ' odds with nature and probability: there was as little keeping in the
' character as of dramatic stratagem or literary exploit in the play. But If. I P i
laughing is an easy gratification, and the causes of mirth need no
nice finding oat. Mr. Williams, in Sirjealout Trqffick,*is harsh
..;- i - and boisterous; and Mr. Johnson, in Charlei, was no better than he > od o) HOoCi
should be. The chambermaids of Mrs. Gibbs will always be held
.3l>0l3'0.V.in delightful remembrance. The comedy of Sweetheart) and Wives *) id <N »"•*•
followed, but the house did not appear to be sixpence fuller than at

T11EATHE.

+¥& e--:V;r<-.«

Colman ami Ganrick". comedy of the Clandestine Marriage was
performed at this house last night, But not in a way (very materially)
to assist the reputation of the theatre. The play itself is one of lh.se
which it is difficult,even in our winter theatres,to '"cast" well througho u t ; and i t is, moreover, of an order peculiarly fitttd'to be destroyed
by the introduction of clumsy actors in its minor characters. AU trie
gentlemen—theju.eni.es especially.—are people of,the Chesterfield
school—very didactic and sentimental. They are a very courtly, ceremonious, minuet-walking, set speech-making, sort of personages, with whom there ia no getting on at all without deportment—a
quality of which the Hayotarket comedians generally are but ill
provided. Lweuell,
for instance—(the gentleman represented by
Mr. Cooper)—has a very nice role throughout (he ">'ay, to
manage. In more than half his scenes—being himself a very
tall, serious, interesting person—he has nothing to do but stand
still, and be acted at by Lord Ogleby and sir John Melville.
Nobody ever did this well, within our recollection., but Mr.
Charles Kemble. Mr. Cooper is a very useful performer; but
he cannot (of his mere mode of doing things) lift a character. He
has not about him that manner—that peculiar tournure—which will
carry a man with perfect ease, thr.iugh a situation of perfect
difficulty. T h e effect is, that the lover's dignity is lost; that of his
mistress necessarily fades along with i t ; Monsieur l^roevelt becomes
rather the butt and 'scape-goat of the comedy ; and we go short altogether of c,ir " nice young m a n , " who should sigh (in fact) for
the benefit ot all the young ladies in the theatre. For another example of the same deficency (and a brighter)—an actor like M r .
vining, whose agremena are about those of a decent banker's clerk—
an actor of this calibre sinks entirely under the very thought of such
a character as Sir John Melville. The cocked-hat—full-dress suit—
quality title—and loDg, nicely-balanced speeches—entirely set at
n.ught even his own estimate of his own powers. Mr. Vining (of
whom we wish to speak with great kindness) is no more able to utter
the mere text put into the mouth of .Vir John Melville, than Mr.
West, who deformed the part of Canton, is competent to play any one
of the characters nightly intrusted to h i m ; and then, to m a k e u p
for this incap-.bil.-y to act any thing approaching to comedy,
the plays are all pulled down into what managers (because the
chimney-aweeps sometimes laugh at it) fancy to be " farce."
I t is but once a year, eve., that we grow critical; but Mrs.
Windsor has no right to make a hit at thegvods. in the part of
Mn. Heidelberg, by leading the Frenchman off the stage, much
as our Mend Potiehinelle, in a pantomime, might lead oft the Devil. •
valuable performers have still less title to resort to extravagance and
riding-house trick. Harley plays Brush—as he plays every thing
else he does—with very great cleverness;—bat, why should he descend to the silliness of blacking h i . mouth in the drunken
scene—-as if he had been intoxicating himself with ink ? Again, I
Mrs. Oibta, in Miss Sterling—in the scene where she speaks
of the " gallantries" of Lord Ogkby, and his " comical expressions of tenderness"—one almost doubts whether this young lady
would mimic the old Lord's cracked voice, and wrinkled features—
(to the extent, to say the least, that the Mitt Sterlings generally do
it)—unless she had a notion that the [salleries were parties to the
joke. And, particularly for Mr. Fan-en, who has gained such high
credit bv his performance of Lord Ogleby—nothing can excuse his
losing sight of the high breeding—the tone—the dignity—even the
somewhat ceremonious formality which distinguishes the eld peer
amidst all bis follies. T h e scene in which tVfirr Fanny—as be
thinks—discloses her penchant for him,. ought to be played
with a delicacy absolutely chevaltretque. T h e finest contrast
u»the ridiculousness of Milord't real situation., is the elegance.
and high gallantry, with which he conducts himself in his supposed one. In this scene, as well aa in the quizzing Stirling about
his gardens and so forth, we have seen Mr. Farren play better than
he did last night i but bis performance was nevertheless of a very
h u h order. Mr. Harley, and Mrs. Gibbs, and Miss Chester were
ail good; Mr. Williams .n SterHnt, better than respectable. For
the rest of the piece—if summer theatre performances are to be
taken as pretensions to acting—it -was as bad, for the most part, as
criticism could desire.

JQ *eaaYOJ

After The Clandestine Marriage, a new farce in two acts, called
'Twonld puzxlc a Conjuror, was performed for the first time.
This title, though expressive, does only partial justice to the piece—
which might not only puzzle one conjuror, but tire (upon themost
moderate calculation) twenty. W e are prevented l i o n giving any account of its plot or fable, by theciraunstsnet; of its not happening
to have any.
T h e scene lies principally in a dock-yard U Sardam, in Holland, at thepcrioj when Peter the Oreat of Russia sojourned to learn snip-building in that country; and the busines.—
(if a great deal of absurd equiv -que and bustle may be so desig- j
uated)—arises oat of the anxiety of the several potentates of E u - '
rope, some to seize the Czar's person, and others to secure
bis alliance. How far the anecdote upon this subject skilfully told
might have been effective, it is not for us to determine. T h e present
piece looks as if it came from the hand of M r . Dibdin , and is a
slovenly, irregular, cireusJike sort of affair. W h y so much fuss is
made about the " C a r , " is not very well explained ; b u t it ends, • » • • . • . . .
after all, (as well as we could understand) in nothing. Then the
whole affair is prodigiously political;—titles are rifcr even than at Ashley's theatre, or the Coburg. One can't stir for Kings, and Counts,
and Admiral), and Barons, playing at bo-peep; and we have an e m . |
peror, three ambassadors, and a burgomaster, all in the same publicbona, at once. T o this hotch-potch, however.—such as it is—Harley
and Listen give the principal support. Listen is the Burgomaster,
whohasone joke—(that he can't read)—and whogoesalongmixedup
with all the plots—(Ood wot as we did')—without comprehending
what they tend to. Harley plays a shipwright, with the same joke as
theBurgomaster—(which is making the most out of a good thing)—for
he can't read neither; and his name being Peter, and he being a deserter from the Russian army as well, two or three very grav" diplomatists mistake him for the Czar. O u t of this particular blunder,
two or three bttle dilemmas arise, at which those persons may laugh
who have the faculty of being amused very strong upon them. For
the rest, something'is done by the arrangement of the dramatis persmut constantly throwing themselves into such situations as must!
excite mirth from then absurdity. Mr. Uston eame forward, and j
asked leave to repeat the piece, in a pair . f shoe-roses which he
.•new, beforehand, were irresistible; and the permission was recorded (in spite of all faults) in a vote, from the house, ef pretty general
approbation.

THEATRE.

The comedy of TA* Country Girl was performed at thU theatre
on Sj:urd*y night.«for the purpose of introducing a " young lady"
(her " first appearance upon any stage") in the character of Peggy.
If last night's performance was really the young ladv*s first attempt,
as far as concerns ease and familiarity with" stage business, it wag one
of the best we have ever witnessed. Putting that fact apart, it din. liA
played promise, and some present faculty. The name of the debutattle has nst reached us ; but she is young, and has fair capabilities of voice and person- Her by-play was most of it well imagined,
and, as soon as she obtained •elf-powession, very well executed ; and her style of performance, generally, showed naivete, id
and, here and there, a touch of whim. Among her best
scenes were the two in which she writes the forced, and afterwards
the real letter to ber lover; both were lightly and pleasantly executed. The story, too, to -Mo-ay, in which she puts the intrigue' upon
Alithea, was good; and the few words also told well in the last seen,
at the window. Tne male character,, in the comedy were not eminently performed; in fact, leading actors, from some cause or other,
generally get out of the play. Harconrt always goes into bad
hands; Mr. Cooper is one of the best that we have seen. A gentleman of the name of Holland (a very respectable wine-merchant)
wan tedious in it for many years at old Drory-lane. Fan-en
ought certainly to have played Moody, and Harley Sparkith; although, in justice to Mr.vining (the more so, as we are not often so
to. tunate as to be pleased with him), he acted the last scene of that
charactf r (the drunken o.e) very pleasantly. The worst part of the
piece consisted in a most afflicting Belville, who weighed down poor
P«Ry (a heavy drawback upon a " first appearance") unmercifully.
This young lady, however, may do very well, if she can keep up to --V JainjibA
the style in which she has commenced, and will assiduously recol.
lect, mat even in the exhibition of rusticity, it is imperative upon an noit!}.)
actress to be always graceful. Afere simplicity of manner, conwith elegance of carriage, frequently stands ladies of con.Sed ,fhvuL.
i .11 tained
talent in admirable stead; and no degree of mind will ever conUJand
tM «*-»*O
success (materially) unaccompanied by those qualities.

L i ^ . m 0^r ,1* .<A new
interlude, in one act, called Birds without Feathert, w«t
• —*• _ M M fh P- *h,"e<i -a*t n-e"ht a t t n e Haymarket Theatre. It would scarcely
vj.l v.^F JEM. MMrJ be worth while to go into criticism about a piece which was decidedly
negatived, and has no chance, we should suppose, of being played
.,„» ..gain ; but it is certain'y difficult to conceive upon what sort ot even
ordinary judgment such a performance could have been pause I
_ upon—f*r tees put into rehearsal. The point of the piece lies in the
- X very stale fancy of a young man being brought up to the age of
I eighteen without ever seeing a woman, and, o ten as this incident
has been dealt with, it was perhaps never so ill worked upon as in
the present instance. The boy (Sirs. T. HiU) does at length see a
girl; and his father tells him that it is a bird—whence the joke of
the title " Birds without feathers." Then an old woman is sent to
this lad, invtead of Madame VestrU, in order that he may be
disgusted, and hate the sex for ever; and Airs. Jones is
selected to accomplish this teat, for which, of all the people
in (he world, she u obviously the most unfit. This dull story is
told hi dialogue, evidently written by a person who cannot write at
all. Madame Vestris wants to know u what a husband is ?" Mrs.
T. HiU has a strange new seni-ation, and wishes to know " if it is a
s,in':" And all this tort of stuff, which has no longer any novelty or
interest about it, requires to be managed not only by a delicate, but
(for the stage) by an ex|ierienced hand. There are some songs sung
in the course of this little matter; but the music is worse, if possible, than the dramatic part of it. Upon the whole, it is such a
failure as a manager should make a point of hazarding as seldom as
possible. The author is a gentleman of respectability, and this is
said to be his first attempt i we should be doing him great injustice
1 if we encouraged him to make a second.

HATHA .Htrr.

A small musical piece was brought out at this theatre on Friday
evening, entitled, Birds without Feathert, being in feet no other than
celebrated story of " Father Philip's Cerse." We
M ail,
scarcely need observe, that the good hermit PhUtp brings up a boy,
and never allows him to see a woman UDtil the age of eighteen, whea
accidentally encountering them, he is told they are geese, on which
the delighted boy expresses a wish to take the superintendance of a
flock forthwith. As dramatised, the father intends his SOD to see a
crabbed old goveraaote first, in order to confirm in him the dislike
which he had inculcated for that horrible animal, woman. The lad,
however, Mrs. T. H I L L , accidentally sees the pupil, Madame VESTBIS, first, and the plot is entirely defeated. W . cannot say much in
favour of this affair, which to say the truth bordered extremely on
th- puerile ; nor was the jnusic very redeeming. In truth, thr* trite
Jvl-JSl/I
supposition has been exhausted in DRTDEJJ'S scenes in the Tempent,
and *re require no more of it. The actors did their duty, but t h .
opposition.)t the close was considerable, and although the ayes had
it, we suspect that the noes will virtually prevail.

THEATRICAL EXAMINER.
HATMARKET.

.sdtiifi

Ox Saturday week, and the following Tuesday, Mr. HAMBLIN, of
the Dublin Theatre, made his appearance on these boards in the character of Hamlet. Owing to an occasional performance of the same
character at Drury-lane, a year or two ago, in consequence of the
sudden indisposition of KEAN, Mr. HAMBLIN was not entirely unknown in London; and that fact, added to thesubsequentacquirem-^nt
of great reputation in Ireland, excited considerable expectation on the
jrese-it occasion, which has by no means been wholly disappointedAll the world knows, that in regard to the performance of tragedy, two ,
opposing actions exist; the one of which upholds a portion of the
studied oratorical and declamatory manner of the old school, while the
.ther eombat.. a Vetttronce, for the spontaneous and impulsive style of
KEAN. We are not .»Oing to enter upon this vide field at present; •?!lf.
to which we advert only in order to observe, that Mr. HAMBLIN haetid«ntly taken his degress in the former of these classes. HU Hamlet
appears to us to be formed on similar principles to those ...Inch have
— ••built up the tragedy of KtMBLB and YOUNG, and partakes both of
its merits and defect-,. We have often been led into a supposition, ' that exterior aad, what is called figure, in particular, is very predisposing to an actor', style of performance in tragedy; and that small
teeu. like <r»RiarKand K EAR, will almost necessarily adopt a different'
theory to one of a more portly appearance. If our theory be correct,
•bat of Mr. H A M U L I " is pointed out by his person, which is tall and
dignified ; and his general deportment, with the exception of a lit!
onal rtiltistibess, is correspondent. His features are favourable,
if not commanding, aud his voice is musical, but wants power for the
vehemence of passion, although he manages it with considerable skill.
Ills conception of Humiet was correct, and altogether pure from the
affectation uf futile ittempts at new readings He spoke the soliloquies
admirably, and his play-scene suffered only by comparison with that • - > '»'
of Y o i m o ; ..nil chiefly from deficiency of voice. Mr. HAMBLIN . , r
(teem* to h.rve made himself master of all the accomplishments of the
Stag*., hn fencing in particular was excellent. In shnrt, without the
exhibition o
inal powers, his Hamlet was a highly creditable
performance, and he will doubtless, sooner or later, secure a corresponden. engagement on the winter boards. We will not lose time by
speaking of tbc test of the caste: with the exception of Mrs. G l o v e * S
very able Qoet'i, it was lamentable; but ir;i'
w.<b tins company. The reception of Mr. HAMRLIN, who we believe
' is stm-m-law to Mr. BLANCBARD, of Covent Garden Theatre, was
-••ry warm and cordial.

HAYMAIIKET.

Mr. and Mrs. HAMBLIN have been accessary to a course of genteel
comedy, at this theatre, having appeared in the characters of Joseph
Surface and Leulv Teazle, and FaUciund and JulLi. In the former, a
good conception of Joseph Surface was marred by too much solemnity
and formality of utterance; while the luaay Teazle of Mrs. HAMBLIM
was agreeable, but destitute of due force and marking. The Sir Peter
Teazle of DOVVTON was rich and diverting; but, as a gentleman, we
suspect that Sir Peter Teazle was never intended by his creator to
make faces. DOWTON absolutely seems to luxuriate in his favour
with the audience, and to play off all sorts of pranks in mere irolicksome self-satisfaction. The rapid improvement of VIKING is generally remarked; his Charles was very pleasant. We have not yet seem
Miss GEORGE from Bath, who has made a favourable debut at this
theatre, but we shall take an eatly opportunity.

Th« Hayinarkct Theatre closed la-t night for the season, with the
j * " , " fti'play ot Every one has his Fault, and the afteroiece of Turn Out.
j
,
Mr. William, acted the part of Harnvniu txc-.icr.tly well: he is
^oneof
^ ^ ^ ^the
^ ^ most
^ ^ ^ ^promising
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^performer,
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ on
^ the stage. After
~ - the
" - di
comedy, Mr. Dowton came fsiward, and delivered " a farewell address" on the part of the managers, in nearly the following tern:. :—
" Ladies and Gentlemen,—I have the honour of appearing before
you. to announce that the performances of this evening terminate
the present season of the Haywarkct Theatre; and to convey to you,
from the proprietors, their grateful acknowledgment of the approbation and indulgence with which yoo. have received, and the extraor.
dinary share of patronage with which you have rewarded, their unceasing efforts to contribute to vonr amusement.
" Ladies and Gentlemen,—It has been noticed that several of
your established favourites were presented to you at not quite so
early a period of the present season as you had been led to expect.
The proprietor, beg to declare, that the delay was caused by the sudden overthrow of an arrangement with the winter theatres (upon the
, faith of which the proprietors of this theatre had entered into many
I weighty engagements), at a time when it was impossible for them to
•upply the temporary deficiencies thus occasioned ; and to prove that
it was .wing to no want of industry on their part., to no considerations of expense, they most respectfully beg leave to plead their eon.
tinusd efforts, in the enlistment of new forces, to maintain to the ,
last the strength of their company.
i.
" It is the intention of the proprietors, Ladies and Gentlemen, to
>?JUt recommence the performances at this theatre a* soon as it may please
His Majesty's Lord Chamberlain to grant them hi. licence, rheir
bein^of
stage beinz
of somewhat small dimensions, and their theatre totally
unprovided with stables, they cannot venture topromise youeither a
precession, a troop of horse, or a herd of elephant* ; and hitherto
they have been unsuccessful in their rflbits to discover a cabinet
of monkies, or a set of dancin-r dogs, altogether desei*"ing
the honour of appearing before an enlightened British audience: yet
while they express their fears that they must therefore continue to
,r.c:
restrict themselves to the representation of the legitimate drama
merely, they are not without a h.pe that their strenuous endeavours
to provide for your amusement, by the production of fair dramatic
novelty, and the engagement of the best biped performers—mere
men and-women—•they can procure, will ensure them the honourable
reward of y»ur patronage and support through a protracted season.
" For myself, and the rest of the performer!, I return you our j
grateful thanks for your kind indulgence towards us.
" Ladies and Gentlemen, for the present season, we all of us most I
respectfully take our leave."
"*The jokes contained is this manifesto are, unf.rrtuBi.tely, something the were, for wear; but that did not hinder them trom being
well taken by an audienc- (to say the least of it) crowded in the
last degree. The cuts at the " large stages," and " horses," and
" processions," elicited, as usual, great applause from the person. ,
who go night after night to be amused with those presentauon.; and ; I
had the matter to be spoken been even of a duller character, themart- i"*
• - r o t Mr. Dowtoa would have given effect to it.
