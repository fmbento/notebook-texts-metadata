Travellers

Benighted;

OR, RAYMOND AND AGNES.
SWITCH OF TUB STORY.—Raymond having completed his Studies, is entreated by his Father to enter on his Travels. H e sets out, accompanied by Theodore, his faithful Domestic. On entering the
Confines of the Forest of Rosenwald, Night drawing on, he loses his Way, and, by the Treachery of
his Guide (Claude), he is led to the Cottage of a Woodman, (Baptists,) the Captain of a Banditti, who
assumes that Duguise more securely to commit his Depredations on the unwary Traveller.
Robert
and Jacques (Sons to Baptistu) return from their Plunder in the Forest, and enter armed. Raymond
is conducted to repose in a Chamber. Baptists and Sons lay a Plot to murder him. Warguerette, in
Order to put Raymond on his Guard, contrives to place a Pillow stained with Blood on bis Bed !
Hubert enters the Chamber, and attempts the Murder, but is prevented by Marguerette's Caution—
Agnes and her Governante now enter the Cottage, being benighted in their Journey to the Castle of
Lindenberg. Raymond, enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her : and Marguerette, giving him
to understand the Wine which is offered is an Opiate, he pretends to drink, and affects to sleep.—
The Murderers, thinking their Victims secure, leave them to Baptixta, who is preparing to assassinate Agnes, when he meets his Death by the very Dagger he had raised against the Bosom of sleeping
Innocence. Marguerette now points out the Secret Door, by which they escape. Raymond conducts
Agnes to the Castle of Lindenberg. Agnes relates the

STORV

OF THE BLEEDING

NUN,

And tells him 'tjri reported the Spectre haunts the Castle every fifth Year. Raymond declares bis
Passion for Agnes, aud is dismissed the Castle. Agnes is told that the Intention of the Countess, in
sending for lit i to the Castle, is to seclude her for ever from the World. Terrified at the Idea, she determines to rely on the Honour of Raymond's Affection.
She drops a Letter from the Turret, in
which she tells Raymond,
" When the Castle Bell tollt One,
Expect me at the Bleeding Nun."
Raymond, enraptured at the Idea of seeing Agnes, keeps his Appointment. T h e Bell tolls One. The
Castle Gates fly open, a(,d the Apparition of the Bleeding Nun is pursued by Raymond. Agnes, as
the Nun, now appeals, and looks in vain for Raymond. She is met by Theodore, takes his Protection. . T h e y are surprised by tbe Banditti.
Agnes confined in a Cavern by Robert, Jacques, and
Claude. Agnes rescued, and tbe Piece concludes with the Union of Raymond and Agnes.

MITCHELL, PRINTER, NEWCASTLE.

Theatre-Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne,
Friday, Feb. 21, 1823.
Mr De Camp, labouring under sincere grief Jor the melancholy
event which took place here on Wednesday night last, begs to inform the public
that, as a tribute of respectjto the\ unfortunate sufferers, he must close the
Theatre this evening.
Much as Mr De Camp may regret the occasion, he is compelled
for his own protection, and Jor the sake of the great body of persons attached
to his establishment, (many entirely dependent thereon) tore-open on Monday
next, the 24th, by which time ADDITIONAL

ENTRANCES

will be

made to the various parts of the Theatre, GAS will be entirely done away
with, WAX

and OIL used in the auditory part of the Theatre, and every

possible care and exertion made to render it safe and comfortable.
Trusting the public will be kind enough to bear in mind his late
heavy losses—by the inclemency of the season—by his property at sea—and
the present lamentable catastrophe, he can only throw himself on their liberal
feelings to be in part extricated from the present difficulties he has to contend
with.
Mr De Camp cannotforbear returning

his thanks for the valu-

able and laborious exertions of Mr Butler, Mr James Watson, and various
other friends,
ixing;

which the confusion of the moment prevented his particular-

and very especially for the prompt and powerful attentions of each and

every medical gentleman who so anxiously lent their professional skill.

Mr BUTLER,

in bringing out "The Italian Wife" prior to its re-

presentation in London, begs to state that he is not without precedent for
so doing, as the tragedy of*' Virginius" was originally acted at Glasgow,
and that of "Fazio" in Bath, neither intended by the Authors for representation, and both of which have since become great favourites in the Metropolis: to use the words of the Preface to the present piece, " It is certainly difficult to conceive how any thing which can reasonably be styled
dramatic should be written without reference to the tones, looks, and actions of the persons by whom it is supposed to be spoken, be they mimes or
real personages";
success.

therefore Mr B. produces it, and feels confident of its

The merits of the play are well known—he need but quote from

the Newcastle Chronicle of March 2g, to find others of his opinion:—
" To the Editor of the Newcastle Chronicle.
" SIR,—I have been much surprised that the work of a gentleman
of this town, " The Italian Wife," a tragedy, has not been noticed in any of
the Newcastle Prints. Where the author is entirely unknown, this tragedy
has excited that attention which its merits so well deserve. In the Dundee
Courier I find an article upon this play, which so well expresses my own opinion that you would oblige a constant reader of your paper by inserting it.
DRAMATICUS.
" T H E ITALIAN WIFE.—A TRAGEDY.
" We may state, that there is considerable tact in the management of
it. It goes on quietly and naturally to the catastrophe, without any interruption from violent and improbable incidents. The characters are well conceived and consistently developed. The dialogue is often conducted with
great spirit, and reminds us more than once of the old dramatists. The
Author has sometimes succeeded, too, in those rapid touches of beauty, those
single bright thoughts, which, in the works of our early dramatists, often
illuminate many dull, dark passages. Such light can emanate only from a
mind in which the fire of genius has been kindled, and which sheds down
upon us those glories of poetry that turn our world into a Paradise, aud all
of us, for the time, into beings of a happier and diviner creation. He is not
an ordinary writer; he is a person of cultivated mind and fine taste; his inspiration is from the right spring, though it is evidently neither the inspiration
of the lakes nor the inspiration of Italy."
Mr Butler apologises to the Author for certain liberties he has been
obliged to take with the play, as alsofor the curtailments which were ne~
cessary to reduce it to the usual length of acting pieces.

If, as Shakspeare asserts, the proper End of the
Drama i s — " To hold as 'twere the Mirror up to Nature, to shew Virtue her own Feature, Vice her own
Image, and the very Age and Body of the Time its
Form and Pressure," the Author claims for this Piece
a Place in the very highest Class of the Drama. A n
animated Picture of every Species of Life in London,
deprived, through the filtering Stone of the Proprietor's critical Care, of all that might disgust or offend
even the mo'st fastidious Imagination, that Experience
of the Economy of Life, and thai Knowledge of
many of its stumbling Blocks, which have heretofore
only been purchased at the Expense of many Pounds,
much Time, and frequently no small Share of Peace
and Health, may here, in a few Hours, for merely a

Playhouse Admission, be effectually and pleasantly
acquired and secured.
As in a Mirror, Life is, in
this Piece, shewn in all its Varieties—Virtue sees its
own Feature, Vice its own Image, and the Age and
Body of the Time is furnished by Author, Artist, and
Dress-Maker, with its Form and Pressure. TOM and
JERRY, it will be seen, have a moral Purpose and an
Aim; they are not left on the Town, but conducted
to a final Home. S U E and K A T E are proved to be
very different Characters from those they have heen
represented; and the Public will be glad to learn how
their old Friend LOGIC was extricated from the disagreeable Situation in which his original Godfathers
left him.

Travellers

Benighted;

OR, RAYMOND AND AGNES.
S K E T C H O F T H E STORY.
Raymond having completed his studies, is entreated by his father to enter on his travels. H e sets
out, accompanied »y Theodore, his faithful domestic. On entering the confines of the forest of H o .
senwald, night drawing on, he loses his way, and by the treachery of his guide (Claud.) he is led to
the cottage of a woodman (Baptist*), the captain of a Banditti, who assumes that disguise more securely to commit his depredations on the unwary traveller. Kobert and Jacques (sons to Baptista)
return from their plunder in the foiest, and enter armed. Raymond is conducted to repose in a
chamber. Baptista and sons lay a plot to murder hrm. Marguerette, in order to put Raymond on
bis guard, contrives to place a pillow stained with blood on bis bed! Robert enters the chamber,
and attempts the murder, but is prevented by Margueretie's caution. Agnes and her govername
now enter the cottage, being benighted in their journey to the castle of Lindenberg. Raymond, enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her; and Marguerette giving him to understand the wine which
is offered is an opiate, he pretends to drink, and affects to sleep. The murderers, thinking their victim secure, leave them to Baptista, who is preparing to assassinate Agnes, when he meets his death
by the very dagger he bad raised against the bosom of sleeping innocence. Marguerette now points
out the secret door, by which they escape. Raymond conducts Agnes to the castle of Lindenberg,
and is leceived by the Baron and Countess (the only surviving relations of Agnes) with much attention. Raymond observing several portraits of a Nun with a wound in her breast, enquires her b i s .
lory. Agnes relates the

STORY OF THE BLEEDING NUN.
She drops a letter from the turret, in which she tells Raymond,
" When the castle bell lulls Ove,
Expect me as the Bleeding A'an."
Raymond, enraptured at the idea of seeing Agnes, keeps his appointment. The bell tolls One. T h e
castle gates fly open, and the apparition of the Bleeding Nun is pursued by Raymond. Agnes, as the
N u n , now appears, and looks in vain for Raymond. She is met by Theodore; a*ks his protection.
Tbey are surprised by the banditti. Agnes confined in a cavern by Ri.bert, Jacques, and C l a u d e Agnes rescued, and the piece concludes with the union of Raymond and Agnes.

A Rivalry existing between the two Forest Hunters, Wilhelm and Caspar, the latter invokes the potent Assistance of ZaroiaL

Gift, Caspar enters on a Compact, bartering his Soul to Lucifer's Agent, Zamiel;—the Period of Caspar's Existence depending
rnly Upon the Retainment of the seventh Ball. Previous to the rising of the Curtain, three Bullets are supposed to have beet*
txpcnded, the fourth wins the Prize of Rangership from Wilhelm ; the fifth is employedtoentrap his Rival—an Eagle is see.
Covering in the Air at an immeasurable Height, Wilhelm discharges the magic Bullet, and uncotitAous of its Power, brings the
Eagle to the Ground. Caspar perceives his Astonishment, and taking Advantage of such, entices him to the Wolf's Qlen, intend*
iug to seduce him to the Acceptance of seven charmed Bullets, the Possession of which would bind Wilhelm as Zamiel's Virion,
arid afford a new Term of Life to Caspar.

SPOKEN B Y MRS. G A R R I C K ,
On the Night of her Benefit, February 25th, 1825,
AT THE

THEATBE-EOYAL, NEWCASTLE UPON TYKE.

I F , in our transient time's uncertain reign,
There be a moment of severest pain,
If, in our little life's erratic round,
The heart may swell beyond its customed bound,
That moment's pain, that heart's unwonted swell,
Is when we bid our dearest friends—FAREWELL !
When pale reflection o'er the memory flings
The sweet remembrance of a thousand things,
When many a buried kindness bursts to view,
And softly whispers—" Oh, I sprang from you,'"
' T is hard, indeed, to bid THE LAST ADIEU !

I t was not mine, with tones of tragic art,
To rouse the feelings, or to fire the heart;
No !—in the soft and simple charms of song,
I humbly sought to please the generous throng;
I n some sweet ballad's wild and beauteous tone,
T o mingle your warm transports with my own.
Perchance, I sung of Home and all its wiles,
Its fond attraction and its cheering smiles ;
Perchance—but why the upspringing list extend ?
Our dearest duties all must have an end.
And now, my longest, dearest must be o'er,
And I must see, must greet you here no more;
Yet, in retirement, in my memory's ear,
Your cherished plaudits will be ever dear ;
And, may I hope, some oft remembered strain
Will in your minds, though distant, still remain;
And thus, in hallowed wise, at once prolong
The grateful SONGSTBESS and her pleasing song !
And now, with grateful thanks for all the past,
A few short words must be pronounced at last—
Such words as still the grateful tongue must tell—
Heaven bless you all! My dearest friends, FABEWELL !

SKETCH OF THB

STORY.

Raymond having completed his studies, is entreated by his father to enter on his travels. He sets
out, accompanied by Theodore, his faithful domestic. On entering the confines of the forest of Rosenwald, night drawing on, he loses his way, and by the treachery of his guide (Claude) he is led to
the cottage of a woodman (Baptista), the captain of a Banditti, mho assumes that disguise more securely to commit his depredations on the unwary traveller. Robert and Jaques (sons to Baptista)
return from their plunder in the forest, and enter armed. Raymond is conducted In repose in a chamber. Baptista and sons lay a plot to murder him. Marguerette, in order to put Raymond on his
guard, contrives to place a pillow stained with blood on his bed! Robert enters the chamber, and
attempts the murder, but is prevented by Marguerette's caution. Agnes and her governante now
enter the cottage, being benighted in their journey to the castle of Lindenberg. Raymond, enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her; and Marguerette giving him to understand the wine which is
offered is an opiate, be pretends to drink, and affects to sleep. The murderers thinking their victims
secure, leave them to Baptista, who is preparing to assassinate Agnes, when he meets his death by
the very dagger he had raised against the bosom of sleeping innocence. Marguerette now points out
the secret door, by which they escape. Raymond conducts Agnes to the castle of Lindenberg—
Agnes drops a letter from the turret, in which she tells Raymond,
" When the cattle hell tolh one,
"•Expect me as the Bleeding Mta."
Raymond, enraptured at the idea of seeing Agnes, keeps his appointment- The bell toils one. The
castle gates fly open, and the apparition of the Bleeding Nun is pursued by Raymond. Agnes, as the
Nun, now appears, and looks in vain for Raymond. She is met by Theodore; asks his protection.—
They are surprised by the banditti. Agnes confined in a cavern by Robert, Jaques, and Claude—
Agnes rescued, and the piece concludes with the union of Raymond and Agnes.

The Story of the Flying Dutchman, or Phantom Ship, la well known and credited by all Mariners, more especially by those who
aail to the New Netherlands. The Captains of Ships seldom arrive at New Amsterdam without bringing some Report of having aeea
tbe strange Ship in the Hudaon; her Appearance was always just after, just before, or in the midst of unruly Weather, and she was
known by all the Skippers by the Name of the STOEM SHIP ; and what is atrange, she is seen with all her Sails set, sailing right against
Wind and Tide; the Crew, all dreased in the Dutch Style, standing motionless as Statues. People who live along tbe River, insist
they sometimes see her in SUMMKB M O O K L I . H T , and that in a deep still Midnight they hear the Chant of ber Crew, as if heaving the
Lead. She keepa lesteningand lessening, till she fades from Sight, like a little white Cloud melting away in a Summer Sky.

LETTERS.
O M E unmanly, insolent Person, has for some Time greatly distressed M I S S C L E A V E R , of the Theatre, with ANONYMOUS
L E T T E R S , advising her to appear on the Stage, on the Night of her
Benefit, in a certain indecent Male Costume, or the W r i t e r (who says
he is acquainted with a Class of Gentlemen of Influence in the Town)
will a d d r e s s t h e different Families in Newcastle and the Neighbourhood, Warning them not to go to the Theatre on that Night, as " some
" shocking Disaster'
will take place. Miss Cleaver advises with her
Friends, who agree, that Anonymous Letters ought not to be attended
to. She takes no further Notice, but issues a Bill of her Benefit, when
the unworthy Being in Question, sends a still more coarse and insulting Letter, saying, that if she does not comply with the Request of the
former Letter, he will write " t o the Barracks, the Mansion House,
" and every respectable Family, cautioning them against an Explosion
u
6f Gas,** signed, " A F R I E N D , BUT WHO MAY BE AN E N E M Y . "
The
last fetter is sealed, and the Arms and Crest are known. I s a Female,
because she is an Actress, to be thus grossly insulted ?—No!
IEH . - > '
This Statement is sent forth by the Friends of Miss Cleaver, for
the Purpose of cautioning those who may receive Letters, not to be
influenced, or to desert the Lady in Question, because she does not
comply with the Request of Insolence.
T h e l e t t e r s will be left with M R . TADMAN, for the Inspection of
the |*ublie, hoping they may lead to an Exposure of the unmanly
Person.

ANONYMOUS LETTERS. Some Individual has for some Time greatly distressed MissCI.EAVER, of the Theatre, by addressing to her, with unmanly Insolence, ANONYMOUS LETTERS, ad. vising her to appear on the Stage, on the Night of her Benefit, in a certain indecent Male Attire, or
the Writer (who says he is acquainted with a Class of Gentlemen of Influence in the Town) will 'address the different Families in Newcastle atid the Neighbourhood, warning them not to go to the
Theatre on that Night, as " tome shocking Disaster " will take place. Miss Cleaver took the Adiice
of her Friends, who agreed with her that Anonymous Letters ought not lo be attended to. She took
no further Notice, but issued a Bill of her Benefit, when the Person in Question, sent a still more
coarse and insulting Letter, saying, that if she does not comply with the Request of the former Let.
ter, he will write " lo the Barracks, the Mansion House, and to.ery respectable Faviily, cautioning
them against an Explosion of Gas," signed, •* A FRIEND, WHO MAY BE AH ENEMY." The last L«tlt r
is sealed, and the Arms and Crct are known. Is a Female, because she is an Actress, to be thu«
grossly insulted ? Is she to be deserted because she will not comply with the insolent Request of a
ba.e, anonymous Letter Writer ? The Letters will be left with Mr Tadman, for the Inspection of
the Public, hoping they may lead to an Exposure of their unmanly Author,
