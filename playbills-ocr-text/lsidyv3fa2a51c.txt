COVENT GARDEN THEATRE. Monday, Fe!>. 24. (circular.) '
In Reply to the Circular dated Theatre Royal, Drury-Lane, Feb. 22, the Proprietors of Coveni Garden Theatre, feel it incumbent on them to state to the Publick the following F*ICTS:
\fl. That Mr. BOOTH having performed two Nights at Covent-Garden Theatre, and a Négociation going on fora Three Year's Engagement, the Drury-Lane Sub-Committee, previous to their opening a Treaty, with Mr. BOOTH, were bound, by iong-eftablithed honourable agreement, to apply to the Covent-Garden Proprietors, and learn from them, if fuch négociation was broken off:—But, contrary to fiich fair and open communication, they, in the abfence of the Covent-Garden Proprietors, fent for Mr. BOOTH to the Committee-Room, where he tialiily iigaed a Memorandum tor syi Engagement ; againft which one of the Covent Garden Proprietors, on his coming to town an hour afterwards, openly and vainly remonftrated with the Sub-Committee.	_
That under fuch circumftances, the Proprietors of Covent-Gardcn Theatre, conceiving they had a lawful claim on Mr. BOOTH’S fervices, were about to take legal meafures againlt him ; when, through the medium of a Friend of Mr BOOTH, who law his did refs of mini! in coiifèquence of the perilous fituation in which he had rafhly and unguardedly placrd himfelf, the Négociation was renewed, and finally terminated on Saturday, w hen the Covent-Gardcn l*re-
gdeters would, w>th pleafure, have permitted Mr. BOO i H to perform tor that vening at Drury-Lane Theatre, but he was literally too ill to make the atw‘npt-
3r//y, For the truth of the above ftatement, and for the juttice of their Cafe, the Proprietors of Covent-Garden Theatre are ready to refer to any Tribunal competent to decide on Theatrical Queftions ; but whatever may be the refult of the decifion, the Proprietors of Covent-Garden Theatre, entreat that Mr. BOO TH may not be made the viftitn of dilutes between the two Theatres; his youth and inexperience alone, having placed him in a Dilemma, from which, it ts hoped, the ufual Candour and Liberalitv of an Englith Publick will ¡till reicue him.
As a PROOF of the ACCURACY of the above STATEMENT, the following Letter from the Honourable DOUGLAS KiNNAIRD, who was the leading member of the fub-committee of Drury-Lane Theatre when the agreement alluded to was ratified, and now poffels a great intereft in that concern, is annexed.
Copy of a Letter from the Hon. Douglas Kinxaird,
to II. Harris, Esq.
Ho. 32, dargesjireet, Feb. 94, 1817,	-
My Dear Sir,
The terms of the honourable agreement between the two Patent Theatre^ to which you allude, 1 have no difficulty hj ftating ;—l was made acquainted with, them as foon as 1 w as called upon to aft as a member of the committee for managing Drury-Lane Theatre, and this aft of our Predeceffors was confirmed by m# colleagues and myfelf, in the conviction of its being for our mutual benefit, i un< derftood it to be diftinftly agreed upon, that when either party became aware thaf the other Theatre had been in treaty with a Performer within a \ ear from fue£ tune, that they were firft to afeertain from their rival that any fuch treaty war’ entirely at an end, before they liftened to anv propofition from the Performer.

Mr. Booth.
In the extraordinary fituation in which the Proprietors of this Theatre are placed by the Licence aiturned by the prefent Committee of Drury-Lane Theatre to difavo«- the adts of ¿heir Predecefsors thev are compelled to Hate to the Public, in corroboration of the di e<51 and honnra!4e confirmation rheir flatement of Tueiday lias received from a Gentleman, who notonouflv Hood foremoft in the confidence and in the a<Ttve ferviee of the Proprietors of that T heatre, that they are ready to prove that the late Mr. Sheridan entered into the Agreement in queHion, whilft the late Patent 1 heatres were Handing ; and that Mr. Whitbread adopted the fame in the firft year of his fuperintending the management of the prefent Theatre. The Committee have l>een guilty of a mis-ßatement in informing the Public that the Proprietors of this Theatre engaged Mrs. Glover to perform for them without previously afeetaining f,om one of the Committee, that no treaty was exiiling between that Lady and the Committee.
If no acT is to be held valid on the part of the prefent Committee, which was not iandioned by every Member of the late body, the Proprietors of that Concern will belt judge what would have become of their Prop ryy, when it is notorious, that of their five Members, during the greater part of laft Summer, only one ever attended the Committee-Room on the days of Bufuiefs; and that after another Member had r turned from the Circuit, He and the aforesaid Gentleman alone conducted the bufinefs of the Theatre for a confiderable time.	, '
The Public will duly appreciate the depth of the reafoning and the in« genuity of the proof, that Theatrical Talent muß fuße , f rom an honour-ble Agreement between the two Theatres, that when either Party becomes aware that the other has been within a year in Treaty (much more in an EngagementJ with a Performer, they full fi> ß afeertain from that other Party that J'uch Treaty is at an end, before they fall proceed to negociaie with the Performer.	-
If the Committee begin now to feel the ill confequences of their oven mif-conduci, let them at once confult the interefl of their Conflituems, if not their own, and repair their Error by binding themfelves formally not to repeat it—If they do not, let them anfwer for the refult to their body of Proprietors. The Prop riet rs of this Theatre have no intereft in luch'qp Agreement that is not common to both—But it is very ealy for an Amateur Theatrical Sub-Committee, with independent Fortune—No Reipon-fibility—and temporary Power—to alouih Laws, and make or annul Agreements at their pleafure j but the Proprietors of Covent Gerden Theatre, like other Traders in this great commercial Country being perfonally liable for their Debts, feel it incumbent on them to aiT 'fa their own defence, by which alone they can pay their Credito s — uphold the Drama—and contribute to the fair and rational Amu:einem of the Public.

MR BOOTH’S
A ppeal to the publie-
' London, Wedtujllay, Fed. 26, IS 17.
IT is with feelings of the moil poignant grief, that I found, by my reception at Covent-Garden 1 heatre tali night, that 1 had incurred the ferious Dil’pkafure of a large Proportion of the Audience. As far as l could judge, from my own obfervation, and that of my Friends, the accufatioDS againft me were
Firfi,—My having left one Theatre, to renew my engagement at another. And Secondy,—A want of rcipect to the Public, in not performing at Drury-Lane on Saturday laft. In regaru to the firlt caui’e of Complaint, 1 humbly fubmit, that, moil une.'peftediy entangled as i have been, between the two Theatres, and involvd in a Con toil, that older and wiltr heads than mine, might have erred in:—And as the whole n atter will ihortly lie explained in a Court of Law. I earuetily entreat ti e Public to vfciit for he rcl'ult of that Decilion. Refpefiting the Second, and, to me by tar the moil feriotis t harge, if I had been allowed the honour of an hearing, 1 think 1 could have fatis.actorily explained to the Audience that, in my delicate fituation, between the clailiing Interefts of the tsvo rival Iheatms, l never could have been fuch a Fool, or a Madman, as to have done a wiifui act to offepd that Pobl.c, by whofe Favour and Support alone i was to exiit in my profeflion.
1 or the caufe of my abfence from my duty on Saturday, I am ready to make the finie Affidavit which has b en nSade already by .\lr. Salter, ¿vho was with me at t;.e time, viz—Thai on Sat.vdav ooming fall, 1 did complain of fevere Indil- . *’ polition, ov mg to the anxiety of mind, and the great fatigue I had fullered during “ the lalt w eek—aim thci . was to u: ■ uily lndifpofed. that I found rnyfelf totally “ incapable of making the < xertion ueceffary to perform that evening—-And that “ 1 wrote the fame to Mr. Rae, which letter ,vas at Drury-Laue Theatre bv Ihree “ o’clock on Saturday afternoon, which wras time fufficien: to have had Hand-bills “priced, to apprize the Public of my Iiicanability to perform; and prevent my “ being the caule of any di(appointment to the Audience.”
Had I thought that fuch an unfair advantage would have been taken of my Illnefs, and that it would have been iniinuated from the ’'tage, tuat my Indifpo-fition was feigned, rath, r than have been ungrateful to my Benefactors, 1 would, at all hazards, have performed, even tho’Death iiad been the confequenee. But, as in every Month, and every week in the Seafon, Inflances of Apologies for Performers on the lcore of indilpofition, are accepted, I could not imagine, that on that plea l lhould be made the firft dreadful Example of public indignation. My Punifhment already has been fevere ;* and finely a British Public (a name tyno-nimous with Generality,) will not, for an Involuntary Error, combine to deprive a Fellow-Citizen of the means of fupporting llimfelf and l'afltiiy.
And again, I molt earnellly conjure the Public, that, if they full think me guilty of a Fault, they will kindly bring to their recollection, it is my 'firft % and fhould they gracioufly grant me their Indulgence, I pledge myfelf, that it iliall be the loft—I will dedicate my whole Life to their Service, and ever remain
Their moft devoted and attached Servant.

SIR,	. w
After having so long received from the display of your eminent abilities, the greatest decree of gratification and instruction, which the highest of Histrionic representation could be-we think upon the near approach of your in-temied farewell to the Stage, with sentiments of deep concern, and if possible, an increase of respect. In justice to the interests of the Drama, and our own feeling's, we would fain postpone the moment of a separation so painful. Fitted by the endowments of Nature and by classical acquirements, by high association and the honourable ambition of excellence, you have, for upwards of thirty years, dignified the profession of an Actor, by your private conduct and public exertions in the British Capital. We beheld, in your personification, the spirit of History and Poetry united. In embodying the characters of Shakespeare and our other Dramatic Writers, you were not contented to revive an outward show of their greatness alone. The splendour of an antique costume—the helmet and armour—the crown and sceptre, all that pertains to the insignia of command, are easily assumed. When you appeared, the habit and the man were, as soul and body. The age and country, in which we live, were forgotten. Time rolled back a long succession of centuries. The grave gave up its illustrious Dead. Cities and Nations long passed away, re-appeared; and the elder Brothers of renown, the Heroes and Statesmen, the Sages and Monarch« of other years, girt in the brightness of their shadowy glory, lived and loved, and fought, and bled, before us. We beheld m you, not only their varying looks and gestures, their proud march and grandeur of demeanour; but the elevated tone of their mind and the flame of their passions. We mean not here to enumerate the various characters in which you have shone as the light of your era: but we may be allowed to say that you excelled in that which was most excellent; that wherever the grandeur of an exalted mind was umtea ’k‘ih Majesty of Person; wherever the noblest organ was required for the noblest expression ; wherever Nature, holding up the mould of c aracter, called for an impression from the most precious of metals, there she looked to Kemble as er gold; there you shone with pre-eminent lustre.
In the austere dignity of Cato, the stern patriotism of Brutus, the fierv bearing of Coriolanus, and the mad intoxication of Alexander, you transported your audience in imagination, alternately to Greece, Rome, or Babylon. Seconded by the well-painted illusion of local Scenery, you seemed every where in your native city; every where contemporary with the august edifices of the ancient world. In you, some of those great characters lived, and we cannot conceal our apprehensions, that, when you withdraw, we shall lose sight of them for a long time, and, as life is short, perhaps for ever. In 1 expressing this sentiment, we feel a warm respect for every Actor of genius. A mind like yours would be wounded by any compliment that was not founded in the most liberal sense of general desert. It is an additional merit in you to have obtained distinction in an age of refinement, and from a public qualified to appreciate your powers. A small light shines in darkness; but you have flourished amidst a circle of generous Competitors for fame, whose various abilities we admire; and in whose well-earned applause we proudly join. They behold in the honours which your country pays to you, the permanence of that celebrity which they have already so deservedly acquired, and a sure pledge of the future honours which await upon the close of their professional career. We, therefore, earnestly entreat, that you will not at once deprive the Public of their gratification, and the Stage of your support. We entreat of you not to take your final leave on the night named for your last performance. All we ask, is, that you will consent to perform a few nights each Season, so long as your health will permit. We adjure you to grant this request, by your own fame, an object which is not more dear to you than it is to us, and we confidently rely upon your respect for public opinion, that you will not cover us w ith the regret of a refusal. We have spared the annexation of signatures as inadequate and unnecessary, even if our numbers and restricted limits permitted that form. The pealing applause of the audience, each night of yomr performance, and the united voice which accompanies this, are the best attestation of the public sentiment.

The PROPRIETORS rtfpe&fully intorni the Publick, that a New Method of
LIGHTING;
and likewife a New Principle of VENTILATING the Theatre, has been adopted. The FIRST has been effe&ed by a MAGNIFICENT CHANDELIER, which from the Centre of the. Ceiling difTufes a loft and brilliant Light around, without obftru&ing the View of a fingle Spectator. In its éffèér, <he Body of Light is equal to 300 Arc.a x d Lamps ; and the Heat is directly carried off through a Tube communicating with the open Air. The SECOND is upon the Principle of a forced Vextilation, by which the Theatre can either, be Cooled or Warmed, and the Atmofpbere of the different Parts .of the Hònfe can be kept to one pleafant Temperature throughout the different Seafons of the Year.
