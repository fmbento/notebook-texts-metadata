Its throb sincere is eloquent as speech ;
When will be presented,

" The sepij^Iire, of which these two chambers form but a small part, is a vast
artificial excavation in a rock distant about three miles from the Nile, to the west of
the ancient city of Thebes in Egypt. Al! (he various passages and halls of wh:'ch
it consists are covered with similarly painted figures in relief, and the whole length
of the tomb equals 309 feet.
In examining, however, this curious monument, its high antiquity ought not for
a moment to be lost sight of, as it would scarcely be just or reasonable to compare
the paintings, which have decorated its walls fot* nearly three thousand years, with
the finer specimens of modern ait. But this is only one of an immense number of
excavations to be found in the neighbourhood.

No mines or catacombs in any part of the world can be compared with these
astonishing places, the number and enormous extent of which, attest the vast
population .of a city, whose antiquity reaches far beyond all historical notice.
It was from the Memnonium that Mr. Belzoni brought the colossal bust of the
young Memnon. as it has been called, now deposited in the British Museum.

The .sepulchre,' of which these two chambers form but a small part, is a vail
artificial excavation in a rock distant about three miles from the Nile, to the vreat'of
the ancient city of Thebes in Egypt. All the various passages and halls of which
it consists are covered- whh similafly painted figures in relief, and the whole length
of the tomb equals 305 feel.
In examining, however, this curious monument, its high antiquity ought not for
a moment to heJtft^-^it,'of,; as it would sfcardejy be just or reasonable to compare
the paintings, which have decorated its walls for nearly three thousand years, with
the finer specimens oT"modern tut. But this is only one of an immense number of
•

excavations to be found in the neighbourhood.
No mines or catacombs in any part of the world can be compared with these
asfdntehing places, the number and enormous extent of wjiich, attest the vast
popul4idn*»fj^^y x |"hoseantiquity reaches fai* Mybnd'all historical notice.
It was from the Memnonium that, Mr. Belzeni brought the colossal bust ef the

in the British Museum.

It is scarcely possibl,e, by description *Q convey an adequate idea of these subterranean "aboaes, W""bf the strange figures with which they are filled. Most

D m H CRIP TI o N
OF THE

Egyptian

Tomb. •

" The sepulchre, of which theso two chambers form hat a small part, is a vast
artificial excavation in a rock distant about three isile^ from the Nile, to the west of
the ancient city of Thebes in Egypt. AH the various passages and halls of which
it consists are covered with similarly painted figures-in relief, and the whole length
of the tomb equals 309 feet.
In examining, however, this curious monument, its high antiquity ought not Jbr
a moment to-be lost sight of, as ft would scarcely be jast or reasonable to compare
the paintings, - which have decorated its walls for nearly three thousand years, with
the finer specimens of modern art. Bat this k'only one of an immense number of
exravaticns to be found in ihe neighbourhood. .
it^-W
No mines or catacombs in any part of the world can be compared with these
astonisbiixg places, the number and enormous extent of which, attest the v*st
. population of a city, whose antiquity reaches ftfr beyond all historical notice.
It was from the Memnonium that Mr. Belzoni brought the colossal bust of the
young Menu.on, as it has been called, now deposited in the British Museum.
It is scarcely possible by description *o convey an adequate idea of these <jubterranean abodes, or of the strange figures with which tbey arc filled. Most
travellers are satisfied wrth entering the targe hall, the gallery, and the staircase ; in
fact, as far as they can conveniently proceed, but Mr. Behtooj frequently explored
the inmost recesses of these extraordinary excavations, which enabled bira to offer .o
the curious, his prese-vt exhibition."
