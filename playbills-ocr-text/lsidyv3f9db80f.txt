THE GERMAN OPERA
Will Open on M03TMPA Y neaet, March IS, 1841,
nd that, impressed with feelings of the liveliest gratitude for the great patronage bestowed upon his exertions throughout
the last Season, he has directed his attention to the selection of
THE MOST POWERFUL COMPANY
et brought to this Country. The impossibility of paying- due respect to the mise en scene in the small sphere of action to hich his means were last year confined, has induced him to select a Theatre, where every justice may be rendered to the {impositions of the Great Masters of Germany, accompanied by those scenic effects to which their own eminence, and the ivor they have received, are entitled. In the short time that has elapsed, since he was possessed, by the Committee, of this .'heatre, the utmost attention has been directed to its embellishment and arrangement, in a manner suitable to the taste, and
convenience of its patrons.

DIKE HUMPHREY’S DINNER,
OK,	9
JACK CADE,
THE LORD OF LOIDON STOKE.
“TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY/’—OldPraceri.
Wow many a popular saying has been for years of every-day use, and in almost every person’s mouth, while its real origin has either been lost in the dust of ages, or endered uncertain by the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has not at some time or other been charged with dining with Duke Humphrey? or at “■east has heard of one of his acquaintance having done so; and yet who can tell in “ what dining with Duke Humphrey really consists—or under what circumstances fAe good Duke,” as he was called, gave rise to the saying.—As far back as the time of Old Fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that day nsistod that “dining with Duke Humphrey” implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul's Cathedral, because—argued they—the Duke was buried there —which, pithily remarks Old Fuller, is as far from the truth a* they from the dinner, even twenty miles oft’—he being buried at St. Albans.—The inhabitants of St. \lbans* in their turn asserted that the saying had its origin in the accidental circumstance of a visitor in the last century having been shut up in the Abbey of that own, where the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned for his hospitality and good cheer, are really deposited, while a party of his friends who came down to that .ncient and loyal borough were enjoying the hospitalities of the Ltodlord of the White Hart. The Oxonians, on the contrary, aflirm that the proverb arose from the * ircumstance of the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, and the fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain in ?hc l ibrary during the hour of dinner, at wliick time it was usually shut, feasting their minds in lieu of their bodies. All of these accounts, though highly ingenious, p\re very fir from the truth. To “dine with Duke Humphrey” no doubt signifies to fast—but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been •eally unknown, and might have remained so but for the discovery of a worm-eaten roll among some mouldering documents in the Record Office, with which the author of this Pantomime has been exclusively favor’d, and with the information drawn from whiah he has now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical details which have furnished the ground-work ot the present Pantomime, and which indisputably relate to this interesting event, effectually set the question at rest or ever, and it will no longer be suspicious to be seen lounging on any of the benches of St. James’s Park between the hours of 3 and 6, as it now certainly is—but persons may at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of being considered “ IMPRANSI.”

THE LORD OF LOi DOW STOWE.
•‘TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY',”—Old Proverb.
! tow many a popular saying has been for years of every-day use, and m almost every person’s mouth, while its real origin has either been lost in the dust of a"»s or e:.dered uncertain by the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has not at some time or other been charged with dining with Duke Humphrey’ °or at •¿it. has heard of one of his acquaintance having done so ; and yet who can tell in “ what dinir.g with Duke Humphrey reallv consists—or under what circumstances •he o°od Duke,” as he was called, gave rise to the saying.—As far hack as the time of Old Puller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that dav M- ted that "dining with Duke Humphrey” implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. raid’s Cathedral; because—argued they—the Duke was buried there - s inch, pithily remarks Old Fuller, is as far from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty miles off—he being buried at St. Albans.—The inhabitants of St \lbans, in their turn asserted that the saying had its origin in the accidental circumstance of a \ isitor in the last century having been shut up in the Abbey of that own, where the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned for his hospitality and good cheer, are really deposited, while a party of his friends who came down to that tent and loyalbornugh were enjoying the hospitalities of the Landlord of the White Hart. The Oxonians, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from the ir< uaistanee of the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, and the fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain in he l.ibrary during the hour of dinner, at which time it was usually shut, feasting their minds in lieu of their bodies. All of these accounts, though highly in^nious .re very fir from the truth. To “dine with Duke Humphrey” no doubt signifies to fast-hut the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been «ally unknown, »ml might have remained so but for the discovery of a worm-eaten rull among some mouldering documents in the Record Office, with which the .other of this Pantomime has been exclusively favor d, and with the information drawn front which lie lias now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical teuils which have furnished the ground-work of the present Pantomime, and whicli indisputably relate to this interesting event, effectually set the question at rest or e- er, and it will no longer he suspicious to be seen lounging on any of the benches of St. James’s Park between the hours of 3 and 6, as it now certainly is—but lersons may at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of being considered “ IMPRANSI ”

Shakspeare's play of the T oo Gent'envcn of Verona—a delightful drama, more familiar to the student of Shakspeare than to the mere playgoer—was produced last night- Some years ago—now Dot a few—the play was produced as an opera, but last night was the first, for a still longer period, of its pro- ' duction as a regular drama: and well was it worth reviving, as an early manifestation, beautiful in itself, of the genius,not yet quite ripened to full maturity, of the great poet of the Teutonic race. There is in the Tuy Gentlemen of Verona a peculiarly southern warmth ; the sprinkling over of concetti, serious and comic, is done with the freshness and recklessness of a new consciousness of creative power; a charming current of poetry flows easily and without effort through a metre which is melody itself. Character, strongly marked, has scarcely yet made its appearance, but the course of the serious part of the drama seems rather to carry us through a company of graceful and elegant sonnetteers. Julia’s speech on collecting the fragments of Proteus’s letter—what is it but a sonnet wanting the metrical form, and written in blank verse ! The conclusion has the very turn of the sonnet, and when Jalia says of the fragments—
“ Thus will l fold them one upon another,
“ Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will”— it is really Fetrarchian. The whole speech is a conceit, but it is just a conceit, as is suited to the atmosphere which the entire play diffuses round us. This was the atmosphere in which the poetical figures of the south really lived and moved ; passion was not allowed to check their fancy, but a thousand concetti were suffered to sparkle around every point of human joy and agony. Octavius Caesar, in Calderon’s Mayor Menstrua les Ados, when suddenly smitten at the sight of a portrait of Herod’s wife, whom he believes to be dead, actnnlly bursts out into a sonnet, strictly so called, on a fanciful struggle between love and death.
In the single character of Juiia, Shakspeare may be said at on^e to have reached perfection, for throughout his works we shall not find a personage more beautifully conceived or more delicately organized. The whole-hearted devotion to Proteus is the leading idea of the character, but then it. is most delicately shadowed out. The maidenlike unwillingness to discover her passion even in the presence of an attendant, who is alxn'-st a confidant; the rapture with which she owns her loye to herself when free from a witness; the feminine vanity which allows her to contrast herself favourably with Sylvia, in the midst of the gratitude she is com-j pelled to feel for her sympathy; the calm dejection with which she perceives the falseness of her lover—all these traits are so many threads to draw’down a character from the regions of abstraction, are so many tints to give vitality to the picture, without destroying its delicately poetical aspect. This part of Julia was last night intrusted to Miss Fortescue, who, though she has performed for some time at the Adel phi, might be considered almost as a debutante on this occasion, as it was her first appearance in the higher walk of the drama. We consider her debut as most promising. Her voice and articulation are not quite in her favour, and she has that sameness in expressing emotions which belongs to a state of training, but she has that which is most uncommon at the present day- real warmth of feeling, real passion, which allows her to abandon herself to her character. It was true that she generally adopted the same gestures, that passion was, as it were, generally directed into the same channels,—hut still there was passion, and there was no mistaking it. The little coquetries of the part she had not distinctly apprehended, but she had caught its devotedness, and when she dwelt on her love for_Proteus, and allowed herself to he absorbed in its intensity, it was impossible not to sympathize. It was a girlish version cf the character, au unsophisticated idolatry of her lover, which displayed itself in rapture. In her interview with Sylvia, when she is disguised a page, and describes her real condition in the speech beginning
41 She hath been fairer, Madam, than she is,” there was so much real grief, such unaffected distress, that the audience were completely touched, and while some gave the loud tribute of applause, others gave the more valuable mark of approbation in their tears. Little crudities may be passed over ; wherever there is anything like genuine feeling and intensity there may we look with hope.
The other perfect character of the To o Gentlemen of Verona is the servant -Launce, a creature of infinite humour and quaintness, a subtle compound of shrewdness and stolidity, with somewhat of an odd sort of kindly feeling at the bottom of his nature, though he is not altogether without malice. He was most efficiently represented by Keeley—indeed who that has seen Keeley can read over the Rpeech on Launce’s leave-taking and not feel that he is the man to play it t The reading the catalogue of his mistress’s virtues—the now complacent, now diffident tone, with which the attributes of that variously qualified lady were heard—the careful balancing of virtue against vice, and the self-satisfied air which pervaded the whole proceeding, caused one continuous roar from the beginning to the end. Keeley seemed to have gone to the very depths of the character, and to have enriched himself with all the force it was possible to find. His fellow-clown, Speed, was a little overdone, but nevertheless cleverly conceived, by Hall. He seized the position of the sophistical manufacturer of conceits, adapted a sort of mechanical movement, and reckoned his quibbling reasons on his fingers with formal precision.
The two Gentlemen,” who seem to have just stepped out of an Italian novel, and who move with admirable ease aui bearing, are, in fact, the most defective, and least elaborated, personages in the whole drama. In these does the crudity of the play really consist—not in the language, which is extamely polished and chaste—not in the metre, which is cor-. rect and smooth to a degree to win the most fastidious ear— , but in the sudden transitions of the principal persons of th* plot. We are aware of th? reading which Mr. Knight has adopted in his Pictorial Skakspcar?, and by which the lines by which Valentine so .suddenly gives away Silvia to Proteus, are transferred to Sylvia and addressed to Valentine, but w? are inclined to doubt its correctness. The exclamation of Julia “Oh me, unhappy !” so naturally follows tbs threatened union of her lover with another, that we find it difficult lo conceive them disconnected, especially as the sudden forgiveness of Valentine, merely on account of the five lines of Proteus, after he has attempted the blackest piece of villany that could have d’sgraced human nature, i3 so rery unaccountable, that a little more improbability may be admitted without any great difficulty. A line in the mouti of the narrator Would account for a transition in a novel which maybe harsh and abrupt with the jet unfinished dramatist who can make the agents alone explain their motives. The early romantic drama was based on the novel ; and even if no novel actually existed on which a particular play was founded, still the habit of adopting narratives might easily lead to a first conception of a plot in a narrative form, which might cause a crudeness in transferring it to the dramatic. Let us be satisfied that a Julia is found in this early work of Shakespeare’s. The “ Gentlemen” w ere excellently played by Macready and Anderson. When the curtain rose, they entered discussing with so mud warmth and frankness, they allowed the dialogue to flow so easily, so nicely avoided an pause between remark and retort to give the full effect to the repartee of their conversation, that it was & sort of earnest of the whole character of the piece. Then the frank kindly feeling of the noble Valentine was heartily sustained by Macready, and the reflective soliloquies of Proteus very nicely spoken by Anderson. The one scene, where what may he entitled a u point” can be made, when Valentine rescues Sylvia, and Trot*»as at the sight of his injured friend starts back in horror—this fived group was admirably executed. by both performers, and caused tumultuous applause.
Sylvia was played by Miss Ellis with care, but with a coldness which placed her in more than legitimate contrast to the impassioned Julia. Compton, by a mixture of foppishness and surliness, and by excellent sense through the whole of his bv play,gave an importance to the small character of Thurio. Phelps, as the Duke, was careful and impressive.
The play terminated amid the loudest applause, aud calls for Macready and Miss Fortescue,who both appeared, the latter in a state of great trepidation. The production of the piece reflects great credit on .the management for two reasons— first, that of its intrinsic worth; secondly, because it shows a decided resolution not to adhere to the “ star system.' The great objection to an actor a manager is, that he may use his power <n bringing forward such pieces alone as may place himself in a prominent position. By selecting such a character as Valentine, Mr. Macready show 3 that he is actuated by no such consideration.
Some beautiful scenery was introduced, but not so as to overlay the drama. A new and splendid curtain made its first appearance last night. It is of crimson velvet, with a broad gold fringe, and ornamented with large gold wreaths of laurel.

THE LORD OF LOIDOI ITOIR
“TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY,"—
low many a. popular saying has been for years of every-day use, and in almost every person’s mouth, while its real origin has either been lost in the dust of ages, or Tiidered uncertain by the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has not at some time or other been charged with dining with Duke Humphrey? or at ¡east has heard of one of his acquaintance having done so; and yet who can tell in “ what dining with Duke Humphrey really consists—or under what circumstances the good Duke,*’ as he was called, save rise to the saying.—As far back as the time of Old Fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that day .asisted that-Mining with Duke Humphrey” implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul’s Cathedral, because—argued they—the Duke was buried ¿here --which, pithily remarks Old Fuller, is as far from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty miles off—he being buried at St. Albans.—The inhabitants of St. Mbans, .n their turn asserted that the saying bad its origin in the accidental circumstance of a visitor in the last century having been shut up in the Abbey of that 'own, where the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned for his hospitality and good cheer, are really deposited, while a party of his friends who came down to that ;; orient and loyal borough were enjoying the hospitalities of the Landlord of the White Hart. The Oxonians, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from the. ■- ircumstance of the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, and the fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain in he Library during the hour of dinner, at which time it was usually shut, feasting their minds in lieu of their bodies. All of these accounts, though highly ingenious, are very fir trom the truth. To “dine with Duke Humphrey ’ no doubt signifies to fast—but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been ¿really unknown, and might have remained so but ior the discovery of a worm-eaten roll among some mouldering documents in the Record Office, with which the author of this Pantomime has been exclusively favor’d, and with the information drawn from which he has now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical ictails which have furnished the ground-work of the present Pantomime, and which indisputably relate to this interesting event, effectually set the question at rest or ever, audit will no longer be suspicious to be seen lounging on any of the benches of St. James’s Park between the hours of 3 and G, as it now certainly is—but j s rsons may at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of being considered “ IMPRANSI.”

JJLGM GADS,
THE LOR» OF LO 1 DON STOSE.
“TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY/'—
How many a popular sating has been for years of every-day use, and in almost every person's mouth, while its real origin has either been lost in the dust of ages, or rendered uncertain bv the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. \\ ho has not at some time nr other been charged with dining with Duke Humphrey? or at
T-ast has heard of one of his acquaintance having done so ; and yet who can tell in “ what dining with Duke Humphrey really consists—or under what circumstances the good Duke,” as he was called, gave rise to the saying.—As far hack as the time of Old Fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that day
insisted that ‘‘dining with Duke Humphrey” implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul's Cathedral, because—argued they—the Duke was buried there —nrhich, pithily remarks Old Fuller, is as far from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty miles off—he being buried at St. Albans.—The inhabitants of St. Albans, in their turn asserted that the saying had its origin in the accidental circumstance of a visitor in the last century having been shut up in the Abbey of that town, where the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned ior his hospitality and good cheer, are really deposited, while a party of his friends who came down to that aucioilt and loyal borough were enjoying the hospitalities of the Landlord of the V hite Hart. The Oxonians, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from the circumstance of the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, anil the fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain in the Library during the hour of dinner, at which time it was usually shut, feasting their minds in lieu of their bodies. All of these accounts, though highly ingenious, »re very far from the truth. To “dine with Duke Humphrey” no doubt signifies to fast—but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been really unknown, and might have remained so but ior the discovery of a worm-eaten roil among some mouldering documents in the Record Office, with which the author of this Pantomime has been exclusively favor’d, and with the information drawn from which he lias now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical details which have furnished the ground-work of the present Pantomime, and which indisputably relate to this interesting event, effectually set the question at nSt for ever, and it will no longer be suspicious to be seen lounging on any of the benches of St. James’s Park between the hours of 3 and 6, as it now certainly is—but persons may at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of being considered " IMPRANSI.

GAME,
THE LORD OF LOKDOI ITOIE,
“ TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY,”—Old Proverb.
low many a popular saying has been for years of every-day use, and in almost every person’s mouth, while its real origin has either been lost in the dust of ages, or dered uncertain by the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has not at some time er other been charged with dining with Duke Humphrey? or at t has heard of one of his acquaintance having done >o; and yet who can tell in “ what dining with Duke Humphrey really consists—or under what circumstances good Duke," as he was called, gave rise to the saying.—As far back as the time of Old Fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that dav «ted that "dining with Duke Humphrey" implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul's Cathedral, because—argued they—the Duke was buried there vhich, pithily remarks Old Fuller, is as far from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty miles off—he being buried at St. Albans.—The inhabitants of St, aits, in their turn asserted that the saying had its origin in the accidental circumstance of a visitor in the last century having been shut up in the Abbey of that ■ v/n, where the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned for his hospitality and good cheer, are really deposited, while a party of his friends who came down to that ient and loyal borough were enjoying the hospitalities of the Landlord of the White Hart. The Oxonians, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from the jmstance of the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey , and the fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain in Library during the hour of dinner, at which time it was usually shut, feasting their minds ia lieu of their bodies. All of these accounts, though highly ingenious, very fir from the truth. To "dine with Duke Humphrey" no doubt signifies to fast—but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been. ( . ¡Ju unknown, and might have remained so but tor the discovery of a worm-eaten roil among some mouldering documents in the Record Office,-with which the ■ hot of this Pantomime has been exciush ely favor’d, and with the information drawn from which he lias now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical ,	„(a which have furnished the gTound-work of the present Pantomime, and which indisputably relate to this interesting event, effectually set the question at rest
t, ever, and it will no longer be suspicious to be seen lounging on any of the benches of St. James’s Park between the hours of 3 and 6, as it now certainly is,—but ... ,suas IT1ay at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of being considered “ IMPRANSI.

' low many a popular saving has been for years of every-day use, and in almost every person’s mouth, while its real origin has either been lost in t . .ivied uncertain by the conflicting statements ot Rival Antiquaries. Who has not at some time or other been charged with dinin* with Duke F it has Heard of one of his acquaintance having done so; and yet who can tell in “ what dining with Duke Humphrey really consists—or under win i good Duke,” as lie was called, gave rise to the saving.—As tar back as the time of Old Fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest Tl - .
i -isted that "dining with Duke Humphrey” implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul’s Cathedral because_argued they—the Duke -
- Which, pithily remarks Old Fuller is as far from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty miles off—he being buried at St Albans.—The inhabitants of St Amns, in their turn asserted that t.ie saying had Us origin m the accidental circumstance of a-visitor in the last century having been shut up in the Abbey of that .	.n, where the remams of Du.ce Humphrey so renowned for his hospitality and good cheer, are really deposited, while a party of his friends who came down to that
a “ arld ¡oval borough were enjoying the hospitalities of the Landlord ot the W h.te Hart. The Oxonians, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from the V umstance ot the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, and the fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain in ■ Library during the hour of dinner, at which time it was usually shut, feasting their minds in lieu of their bodies. All of these accounts, though huffily ingenious very far from the truth. To * dine with Duke Humphrey no doubt signifies to tast-but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been *< "*>' unknown, and might have remained so but for the discovery of a worm-eaten roll among some mouldering documents in the Record Office with which the affinor of this Pantomime has been exclusively favor d, and with the information drawn from which he has now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical -ails which have furnished the ground-work of the present Pantomime, and which indisputably relate to this interesting event, effectually set the question at rest .... ever, and it will no longer be suspicious to be seen lounging on any of the benches of St. James’s Park between the hours of 3 and C, as it now certainly is but Nons may at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of being considered “ IMPRANSI ”	J

“TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY,”—Old Proverb.
How many a popular saying br.s been tor yoors of every-day use, and in almost every person's mouth, while its real origin has either been lort in trie dust of ur?.%, or rendered tr,certain by the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has not at some time or other been charged with dining with Duke Hunjjihrev? or at mast lias heard of one of his acquaintance having done so; and yet who can tell in “ what dining with Duke Humphrey really consists—or under what circumstances the good Duke ," as he was called, gave r.se to the paying. As far back as the time of Old Fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that day insisted that "dining with Duke Humphrey ’ implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul's Cathedral, because—argued they—tfte Duke was buried there —which, pithily remarks Old Fuller, is as far from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty miles off—he being buried at St. Albans.—-The inhabitants of St Alban, in their turn asserted that the saying had its origin in the accidental circumstance of a veitor in the last century having been shut up in the Abbev of that town, where the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned foi h:s hospitality and good cheer, are really deposited, while a party of his friends who came down to that ancient and loyal borough were enjoying the hospitalities ot the Landlord of the V. bite Hart. The Oxonians, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from the circumstance of the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, and the fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain in
the Library during the hour of dinner, at which time it was usually shut, feasting their minds in lieu of their bodies. All of these accounts, though highly ingenious, are verv nr from the truth. To “dine with Duke Humphrey ’ no doubt signifies to fast—but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been really unknown, and might have remained so but for the discovery of a worm-eaten roll among some mouldering documents in the Record Office, with which he author of this Pantomime has beer, exclusively favor’d, and with the information drawn irom which he has now great pleasure in presenting the public.

“TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY,”—OM Proverb-
Mow many a popular saying lias been for years ot eve.-y-dav use, and in almost every person's mouth, while its real origin has either been lost m the du$e if a-es or rendered uncertain ' v the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has not ar some time or jther been charged with dining with Duke Humphrey? ’or at least has beard of one of bis acquaintance having done »0; and yet who ran tell in *• what dining with Duke Humph«y really consist«—or under what circumstances he good Duke.' ar in: was called, gave rise to the saying —-As Jar Iv.ck as the time of Old Fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that day nsi.-ti ri that "dining with Duke Humphrey" implied walking during dinner-time in the body of Sr. Paul’s Cathedral, because—argued they—the Duke was buried (-here —which, pithily remarks Old Fuller, is as tar from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty miles off—he being buried at St. Albans —The inhabitants of ¿1 Vlbacs, in their turn asserted that the tying had its origin m the accidental circumstance of a visitor in the las" century having been shut up in the Abbey of that . own, hen- the remains if Duke Humph«y, so renowned for his hospitality and good cheer, are really deposited, while party of his friends who came down to that .ncient and loy.U borough were enjoying the hospitalities of tne Landlord of the White Hart The Ov mans, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from ihc Mcumstanre ot he Bodleian Library having been iounded by Duke Humphrey, and the fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed t. remain in the. ' ibrary during the hour of dinner, at which time It was usually shut, feasting their minds in lieu of th»ir bodies. All of these accounts though highly ineenous «re very far from the .rutn. To “dine with Duke Humphrey" no doubt signifies to last..but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion bare hitherto been teally unknown, ami might have remained so but for the discovery of a worm-eaten rod among om mouldering documents in the Record Office with whs , tne author of this Pantomime hat been exclusively tavor’d, and with the information drawn from which he has now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical Retails which have furnished the ground-work of the present Pantomime, and which indisputably relate to this interesting event, effectuallv set the question a- reat
ilar ever, and it will no longer be suspicious to be seen lounging or, any of the benches of St. Jamfe'i Park hefwevn rh • !._r r. of t and « as it now certainly is ' hut arsons may at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of being considered ' JJUPEANSI

“TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY,”—0MProverb.
'-!ovr osaiw a popular saying lias been for years of every-day use, and in almost every person’s mouth, -while its r.-ai origin has either been lost in the dust of ages, or
-	iidored uncertain by 'be coiidictmg statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has not at some time er other been charged with dining with Duke Humphrey? or at as: has heard of one of his acquaintance having done so; and yet who can tell in “ what dining with Duk. Humphrey tea!!} consists—or under what circumstances
1 ,e "ood Duka,” as he was called, gave rise to the saying.—As far back as the time of Old Puller, the enquiry was i subject of interest. The wits of that oay -sis'ed that ‘‘dining with Duke Humphrey" implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul’s Cathedral, because—argued they—the Duke was buried there -which pithily remarks Old Fuller, » at fer from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty mile; off—he being buried at St. Albans.—The inhabitants of St, vlbans in their turn asserted that the saying had its origin in the accidental circumstance of a visitor in the ust century having been shut up in the Abbey or that ... ‘wa Tlirre the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned for his hospitality and good cheer, tie really deposited, while a party of his friends who came down »0 that
■	\,.j»nt and loyal borough were enjoying the hospitalities of the Landlord of the White Hart. The Oxonians, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from the ircumstance of the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, and ’.he fact that poor scholars, with whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain in ie Library during the hour of dinner, at which time it w«s usually shut, feasting their mind- in lieu of their bodies. AU of these accounts, though highly ingenious,
_ y,.r¥ f)r frolu the ti nth. I'o “dine with Duke Humphrey’’ no doubt signifies to fast—but the particular - ircumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been ■ eally"unknown, and might have remained so but for the discovery of a worm-eaten roll among some ntuUdering documents in the Record Office, with which the •utbor of this Pantomime has been exclusively favor’d, and with the information draw n from which he has now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical
■	efai’s which have furnished the ground-work of the present Pantomime, and which indisputably relat e to this interesting event, effectually set the question at rest
-	jr ever end it will no longer be suspicious to he seen lounging on any of the benches of St, James’s Park between he hours of 3 and v, a* it now certainly is—but •iersons’mav at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of being considered “ IMPRAN3I,

“ TO DINE WITH DUKE HUM PH 11EOld Proverb
»«OY* TttxiiV a. popular saving has been for »ears of every-day use. ami in almost every person’.- moatv, while it. r. al origin ¡¿as either been lost in the dust of ages, or •• u iered uncertain by the conflicting statements of Ri al Antiquaries Who has not at some time or other been .-barged with dining with Duke Humphrey I or it »it. has he&td of one of his acquaintance having done -o ; and yet who ran tell m “ what dining with Duke Humphrey really consists—or under what circumstances . good Duke,” as he was called, gave rise to the saying.—As far hack as the time of Old fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that day I çi»tod that “dining with Duke : lumphit-y’’ implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul’s Cathedral, because-—argued they—tue Duke was buric-d there
-	y.hich, pithily remarks Old Fuller, is as far from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty mile- oKt-Ih- being buried at Sr. Albans.—The inhabitants of Si,
ms. in their turn asserted that the saying had its L-rigin in thi accidental circumstance of a visitor ;:i the last century riving been shut up in the Abbey of tnat - r where the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned for his hospitality and good cheer, are reahy deposited, while a party of his friends who came down to that enl and loyal borough were enjoying the hospitalities ot the Landlord ot the White Harr. Tin- Ottomans, ou the contrary, affirm that tiw pmvtrb aro»c from Üie ■■ »instance of the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, and the fact that poor scholars, v ith hom foods ran low, were accustomed to remain m : , I ibrary during the hour of dinner, at which time it was usually snut, feasting their minds in lieu of tneii lodie-1 All of these accounts, though highly ioger.iou .
I very f»r from the- truth. To "dine with Duke Humphrey” no doubt signifies to fast—but the particular circumstances which ltd to this conclusion have hitherto been Siit-y unknown, and might have remained so but for the disc, very of a worm-eaten roil among some inr.in-U-rmg documents in ’.he Record Office, with which, the minor of ti: i’vritoinimt has been exclusively favor’d, and with the information drawn from which l.e has now great ckusure in presenting the public.

“TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHiMiY,Old Proverb.
Hob it. an v a popular saying has been for years of every-day use, and in almost every \. j n a •» • fit, \h I • i‘s J o*. i i. is • Itlit-r been lost in the dust of ages, or .flered v.uverthin by the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has n -t at on. • n.nc th. r C \ with dining with Duke Humphrey f or at. I- . t has heard of oue of his acq laintaace having done so ; rmd yet who can t**ll m “ what din . r i:h Duke II jinpln y really consists—or under what circumstances tin good Di ke,” as he was cailed, gave rise to the saying.—As far back as the time of Old Puiler, rhe < nquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that day ubi Acd that “dining with Duke Humphrey** implied walk ng during dinner-time in the body ol >• Paul'- i atlu irnl, because—argued they—ti e Duk< was buried th-re - which, pit. !y remarks Old Fuller, a? i-.r trom the truth as they from th • dinner, even twenty miles off- -he being buried at St. Albans.—The inhabitants of Sr, v.Uins, in rueir turn asserted that the saying 1» * 1 Rs on gin in tin accidental circumstance of a visitor in tl • la-.t century having been shut up in the Abbey of tint •, n, v.iic". th-. remains or Duke Humphrey, so renowned lor his hospitality and v»i:d cheer, are really deposited, while a party of ins friends who cam«' down to tha -¿cut and loyal borough were u. ; ig the 1* -p;T.diti.-s of the Landlord of the \\ bite Hurt. The Oxonians, on the contrary, affirm that the proverb arose from the t i ur.stance oi the Bodleian Library having been founded by Duke* Humphrey, an 1 the fact that poor scholars, .vith whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain ia oe Library during the hour of dinner, i whit 1; time it was usually shut, feasting their minds in lieu of their bodies All of these accounts, though highly ingenious, it.* very in roi n the truth. To “dine with Duke Humphrey” no doubt signifies to fast—but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been e>:.y unknown, and might have remained so but for the discovery of a worm-eaten roll among some mouldering documents in the Record Office, with which the

DUKE HUMPHREY’S INNER,
SACK CADE,
THM LORD O F EOIW«l »	© M.
“TO DINE WITH DUKE HUMPHREY,”—OM
Hovi many i popular saying has been for years of every-day use. and in almost every person'« mouth, while its real origin has either been lost in the do t of ages, or rendered uncertain by the conflicting statements of Rival Antiquaries. Who has not at some time nr other been charged with dining with Duke Humphrey? or at least has heard of one of his acquaintance having done so; and yet who ran tel! in " what dining with Duke Humphrey really consi-ts—or under what drcumstaaces he good Duke,” «3 he was called, gave rise to the sajiuj.—As far back as the time of Old Fuller, the enquiry was a subject of interest. The wits of that day nsisted that “dining with Duke Humphrey” implied walking during dinner-time in the body of St. Paul’s Cathedral, because—argued thee—the Duke was buried there -which, pithily remarks Oid Fuller, is as far from the truth as they from the dinner, even twenty miles off- he being mried at St. Aloans.—The inhabitants of St, Ibans, in their turn averted that the saying had its origin in the accidental circumstance of a vi-ilor in tk last century hi» eg been shut up in the Abbey of that wn. where the remains of Duke Humphrey, so renowned for hi» hospitality and good cheer, are really uv; »sited, we iio a party of his friends who came down to that dent a d loyal borough were enjoying the hospitalities or the Landlord of the White Hart. The Oxonian-, on the contrary, ,.iiirm '.hat tee proverb arose from the cunutance of the Bodleian library having been founded by Duke Humphrey, and the fact that poor scholars, nth whom funds ran low, were accustomed to remain .v. -e Library during the hour of dinner, at which time it was mually shut, feasting their minds in lieu nf their bodies. All of these accounts, though highly ingenious, ,, verv flr from the truth. To "dine wi'h Duke Humphrey” no doubt signifies to fast-.but the particular circumstances which led to this conclusion have hitherto been
. illy unknown, and might have remained so but for the discovery of a worm-eaten roll among some mouldering documents in the Record Odice, with which the th.-r o' this Pantomime has beer, exclusively favor’d, and with the information drawn from which he hit- now great pleasure in presenting the public. Those historical ;aiT which have furnished the ground-work of the present Pantomime, and which indisputably relate to this interesting event, effectually set the question at rest n. ever, and it will no longer be suspicious to be seen loung.ug on any of the benches of St. James’s Park between the hours of 3 and 6, as it now certainly is--tut ,, -Mms may at their pleasure take their perambulations there without any fear of Mag considered ” IOTB AJfflt,”
