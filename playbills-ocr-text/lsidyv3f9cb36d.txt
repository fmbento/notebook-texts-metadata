LORD BYRON’s Tragedy of MARINO FALIERO, was received, last Night, with the Applause and Acclamation which had been anticipated from the high genius of its distinguished Author, Its repetition would have been announced for this Evening, as a matter of course; but certain Persons, on grounds at present incapable of being under-» stood, and which remain to be explained and justified, have thought fit to obtain an INJUNCTION in CHANCERY, against the Representation of the PLAY. Under these extraordinary Circumstances, the further Performance of the Tragedy must for the present moment be suspended. It is conceived, however, that the impediment thus thrown in the way, not only of the Interests of the Theatre, but of the Gratification of the Public, can be but of very short duration, and that the Piece will, before long, be again exhibited with the brilliant success which attended its performance yesterday Evening.

As the legal question in respect to the Performance of Lord Byp.ox’s Tragedy is still to be discussed, much remark, as to what Iras passed, would be, at present, unnecessary and improper. Nothing has been done, on the part of the Theatre, ia this affair, which has not, in numberless instances, occurred before; and the practice of Theatres, in such cases, will, no doubt, continue the same, unless the law shall show it to be erroneous. On one point, however, it is material to guard against misapprehension. It has been somewhere suggested, that the manner in which this Play was produced originated in sordid motives. If this refers to the fact of the Tdst having been obtained from the Publication, that fact justifies no such inference. The noble Author is fully aware, as his immediate Friends and Agents in this country
r
are, that any Compensation for the first possession of his valuable Work, within the capability of the Theatre to offer, and which suth an Author cotdd have condescended to accept, was at his command ; and that, in the tender submitted to bis Lordship, while the Tragedy was understood to be in progress, all possible delicacy and attention were obser\ed, as to the mode by which such object of compensation could be effected, llis Lordship's Publisher, also, well knows that there was an earliest disposition to admit him to a participation in the Benefit of the Performance, could the Performance ha\c taken place before the Publication. So far, the public mitul should be, at once, set right. When the Possessor of this Theate shall reject any literary effort, as unsuited to stage use, and shall, afterwards, on publication, attempt te make such materials available, then, and not until then, will he plead guilty to a disposition to withhold from genius the reward to which it is entitled; and to which a stronger claim could not have existed, than in the present interesting and splendid instance.
Of the fitness of Lord liyron’s Tragedy for Representation, as performed at this Theatre on Wednesday last, the effect produced on the Audience of that Evening may sufficiently speak. No impression could have been more forcible: no applause more genuine, or perfect.

PROGRAMME of the OPERA.
The kingdom of Thrace having incurred the wrath of Apollo, had been compelled by the God, yearly to immolate a Virgin on his altar. Demophoon, the King, having consulted the Oracle as to the means of averting this sacrifice, received the following answer:
“ Heaven» wrath shall cease, when to himself is known
“	The innocent	usurper of mthrone!”
The Opera commences at the time of the approaching Sacrifice, when the name« •of all the Thracian Virgins, are ordered to be placed in an Urn, from which the victim is to b« drawn by lot. Cleanthes, a Thracian nobleman, agitated by fear for his daughter, Dirce, reproaches the King with sending his own daughters away, to save them from the hazard of the Urn.; and Demophoon, irritated at his boldness, order# Dirce to be sacrificed, without waiting for its decision.
Dirce is the wife of Tinsanthes, who i« believed to he the eldest soil of Demophoon. But as the Thracian laws ordain death to any subject who weds with royal blood, their union is kept secret, l'emophoon, sending for Timanthes from the camp, destines him to marry' Lysia, Princess of Phrygia, who has been conducted to Thrace by Cherintbus, Demophoon’s youngest son. Timanthes learning the danger of Dirce, betrays his passion to his father, by his earnest entreaties in her behalf and her fate, iu consequence, becomes more inevitable. Timanihes, in despair, then attacks the Guards conducting Dirce, and sets her f ree, but yields when he meets his father, overcome by his reproaches. Dirce is about to be sacrificed, when Timanthes confesses their marriage, and they are both condemned to die, by the violated law. Demophoon, however, overcome by the entreaties of Lysia and Cherinthus, consents to save them both and acknowledge Diree his daughter. In the midst of joy Timanthes is struck with horror by receiving a paper from Cleanthes, which proves Dirce to be the daughter of Demophoon ; he casts her from him, but is restored to happiness by discovering from another document, that he himself is the son of Cleanthes, and t!>e c‘ Innocent Usurper” alluded fo by the Oracle.
Apollo’s wrath ceases, the dreadful sacrifice is abolished, and Cherinthu? now the Heir of Thrace espouses I Asia.
