[The Story of this Piece Isfoundedon historical facts, which occurred during the reign of Queen Elizabeth $ the leading features
of which comprise the providential escapes from assassination of an Orphan, Pagetothe Queen, who has bean received into royal
favour, having saved the life of his illustrious Mistress; and the interposition of Providence in averting the foul deed, and in ultimately
hurling destruction on the head of its perpetrator. The only evidence of the- guilt of the Solitary of the Heath, is Gilbert, who ba» assumed idiocy, by mean3 of which he has preserved his own life, and escaped from the gloomy walk of a dungeon, where he had been Confined upwards of 8 years, and livestobe the instrument of destructiontothe Sieur Arnaud, and the means of restoringtohit hereditary
rights and honors his Master's Son, the Orphan Page. The serious incidents of the piece are happily relieved by the native humour of
a British Seaman, and his hold intrepidity in the cause of justice.]
