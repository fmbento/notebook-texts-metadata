T o delineate the whole story on which this Piece is founded, would perhaps,
by anticipation, be the means of depriving an enlightened audience of that
pleasure and surprise which arise from scenes at ouce novel and. striking.-—<
Suffice it to say, it is a Dta.ua, in the compilation of which, the elegance of
diction, and the striking incidents that rapidly succeed each other to a grand
and final climax, combine to render it one of the most pleasing representations
that grace the English stage.

Rosamond

IN WOODSTOCK BOWER.

During the Evening,

T h e story of Rosamond is au event as remarkable and pathetic as any in the records of
E n g l a n d , a n d the effect produced by this Tragedy in representation, at once proves how admirably calculated every circumstance is for a Dramatic purpose. As an Historical F a c t ,
it claims respectful attention. Dining the reign of Henrv I [. he became enamoured of the
beautiful Rosamond, daughler of the noble Clifford; and frequently obliged to leave the
kingdom, he contrived a retreat for Ins Mistress, as a security against the jealous anger of
Queen Eleanor. A subterraneous labyrinth led by different windings to W O O D S T O C K
B O W E R (then the secret abode of Rosamond); the avenue to this intricacy could only be
discovered by a C L U E O F S I L V E R THREAD,
which was secreted in a hollow T r e e ,
near Woodstock Bower. The nature of this Clue was known only to those in the confidence
pf the Ifing—the Abbot of Glastonbury waj a favourile of the Qneen, as well as a confident
tial intimate of H e n r y ; but the Kiug's favours not keeping price with the 'desires of thf'
subtle Priest, he resolves revenge—unfolds the whole to Eleanor, who enters the labyrinth
surprises the unsuspecting fair one in her calm s e c u r i t , , and effects her death bv chln-in" her

On Monday Evening, Tebruary 28, 1820,
Will be revised C o m a it's celebrated Play of the

Surrender of Calais
In rtiiK Dram, .re cnmpri.ed TnaejEov, COJCEDV, OPERI, and mme degree ol FARCE,
, e | «o happily ia the variety blooded that one seen, never diminialie. the interest of
another, tiut they all combine to produce a mo-.| taluabie composition. .Cdwiird III.
afier the balle ofCres.y laid seige toC.l.is, made hi. Approarbe. and .Hacks without
intermission, but the Ciliien. were o-twlinaie in repelling .11 hi. effort. ; at length
feiniue did more for Edward then arms he i.-»ued order, if they meant to safe Iheir
City they mini .end him Six of itieir principal Cmien., wilh HALTERS ROUND
THEIR NECK.*!, tendering the City Keys. Six men who prized virtue dearer t h e .
Vfc voluntarily iffered up their inestimable Head, to

PRESERVE THEIR COUNTRY
A Solemn Procession

Six Citizens to Execution !
Qoeen Phillip, intercede^—Mi Esward fpJMbeir i'reservatioo, convince, him
the stage otL-hieh They would suff'e'rvw.ufd be to tbem a stage of honour,

Honour of the English Nation !!
That nothing now remained of leaving bira a share ia the j.,lt>r- of this action
save that of granting au indi.pensahle pardon to this brave but little

Band of Patriots;
Tlie highest panegyric that can be pronounced on (his Play is—I hat the
S U R R E N D E R of CALAIS i« considered, by every critic, as the very best of all
the author's numerous and successful production.. It presents a most striking

LESSON TO GREATNESS,
Shewing, that excellence is not of Blood, of Title, or Station; that Virtue
gives a dignity,

Superior to ENGLISH.
that of Kings!! If

(Partly taken from a popular Piece which has for some time past attracted all P a r i s , and founded on L O R D
iclcbi'ited Tale) called T h e

BYRON's

Vampire;
Or, The Stride of the Isles.

This Piece is founded on the various traditions concerning the V A M P I R E S , which asseit that they are Spirits,
deprived of all hope of Futurity, by the crimes committed in their mortal state ; but, that they are permitted to roam
the Earth in whatever forms they please, with supernatural potrcrsof Fascination—and,
that they cannot be destroyed,
so long as they sustain their dreadful existence, by imbibing the B L 0 0 D OF F E M A L E V I C T I M S , whom they are
first compelled to marry.
The Piece has been got up with cniiiply New and

SPLENDID S C E N E R Y , MACHINERY, DRESSES, 8e DECORATIONS,

Mr. Williams has particular satisfaction in informing his Patrons and the Public in general, that through the
exertions of a Friend at Btjth, he has been enabled to procure M. S. copies of the Words and Music of that highly
approved and attractive Comic Piece, in two Acts, called The

Lady and the
Devil!

Written by W. Dimond, Esq. Author of the «• Foundling of the Forest," " Peasant Boy," .' Hunter of the
Alps," &c. & c and performed at the Theatre-Royal, Drury-Lane, with unprecedented success! The great
attraction that attended each representation, induced Mr. Klliston, the Manager, to purchase the Copy.right, both
of the Words and Music, in order to confine the representation to his own Theatre, allowing Mr Dimond the
right of one for his, (the Bath,) which, through the kind interest of his Friend, Mr. W. has been enabled to procure!
