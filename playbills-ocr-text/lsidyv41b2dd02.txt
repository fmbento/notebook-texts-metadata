Notice respecting the Galleries.
The repeated complaints which have been made against the system of various interruptions practised in the Galleries consisting of personalities, gross language, the discharge of missiles, and general noise and disturbance, have called forth the ,troQ<rest attention of the Lessee ; and out of proper respect to thé Pafrons of the Theatïa, and to ofclriate the looses which
tl*e property has experienced by these continued outrages, every means will be adopted to further the desirable object of removing them. Additional Police will be distributed through the House, and, aided by the light of the Nefê Chandelier, detection of the parties (committing these offences) will unavoidably follow, It lg the firm determination of the Lessee to prosecute, to the utmost
exteqt of the law ; and, above all,
To Publish the Names of the Offenders,
Without any preference to parties, whoever they ffiny be. But While this' proceeding is obviolisly hëeessafy, the Lessee confidently relies on the co-operation of the Public) and appeals to that good feèling, which is tbeir Chief Characteristic, to save themselves from the disgrace such scenes produce; to protect the property from the injury they will inevitably bring on it; and, above all, to spare him the painful necessity of reverting to measures, which he will make evfery exertions to avoid ; but will, at the same time, if necessary, firmly resort to. ..1	'	.
