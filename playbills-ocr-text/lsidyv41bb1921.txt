BELL:

OR, THE DUMB SAILOR ROY.
Written by the Author of the Floating Hcaro», Pilot) SJC,
This Mclo Drama, or in the modern phrase. Nautical Drama, is founded on a Talo
of Terror, (antecedent to the Reformation)- T h e Biar, Ro< K, or the I.VCHCAPJR
ROCK, as it is more generally designated by Mariners, is a sunken Hock, off the North*,
East Coast of Scotland, and near to the now desolate little Island, called IWCHKEITH,
and is very dangerous to Sailors, the Shores exhibiting nothing but deep Caverns,
shelving Cliffs, and towering Rocks, T h e Abbots of Aberbrothock, a religious
foundation dedicated to St. Marnock, standing near the Coast, caused a large Bell to
be erected on the Float near to the fatal Rock, so as to ring by the agitation of the
Waves, and by this simple means to indicate to the bewildered Seaman, the perilous
situation in which lie was-placed. There is a tradition current among the Inhabitants, that the Bell was cut from the Float, and stolen ; and that the Person who
committed this nefarious act afterwards met his fate by Shipwreck on this very Rock,
during a dark and stormy night. On this tradition Mr. Ball has founded bjs Piece,
which is judiciously chosen for dramatic effect..

On MONDAY EVENING, APRIL 25th, 18:11,
,

, Will be Acted the Fashionable and Popular Comedy of T H E

Hypocrite.
AS ACTJUD BY HIS LATS MAJESTY'S COMMAND.

" When caps into a crowd are thrown,
" Each man what fits bira, calls his own."
This Comedy, originally the Tartuffe of Moliere, first translated and adapted to British habits
by Cibber, and subsequently assuming its present form and name, under the skilful revlsal of
flirkerstaff, has, in all his various applications, been found an useful antidote to the cowardly
and contemptible vice, which is the object of its satire. But, although ranking high in public
estimation, in the several ages, the circumstances of which, it has moulded and remoulded to
meet, at no period has it been more popular than the present 5 for crowds have thronged to witness
its oft repeated representation ; and" even His late Majesty condescended to mark his opinion of
the justiceofitflcensure, by commanding itsperfbrmance. P e r h a p s 8 u c h a p l a y a s t h t H y p 0 , . ; | . l t e
was never So necessary, nor slich Satire as it contains, ever so provoked as at the present moment;
for at no former period did sanctimoniousness make so formidable a stand against true religion j
never before were such fearful inroads made upon the comforts of civilized life, by crafty pretenders to holiness ! nor ever were the morals of the poor, and the pockets of the rich, in such
peril, from ignorant and cunning traffickers in religious hypocrisy.
The Stage does not presume
to interfere with creeds antl consciences, it does not set itself up as a theological dictator; but
•vice, in every form, is a fair mark for the dramatic satirist,—

And the drama does a real service to society, when It holds
up to scorn and contempt, the jobber in righteousness, the pious
pilferer, or, in one word T H E HYPOCRITE.
*

W e live in an age of religious speculation ; and it depends upon the present generation,
whether our children shall be, as our fathers were, cheerful and rational christians, or, gloomy
and intolerant asceticks. For under the influence of the new light all is darkness; the harmless
pleasures of life, are denounced as deadly sins ; the gaieties of youth, and the social enjoyment,
of age, are called criminal backslidings ; and the mental amusements, which the wise and virtuous have honoured and approved, are anathematized us the work of D a e m o n s .
Mockery
would be superfluous on a subject so essentially abused, but that a large portion of society, c s .
pecially in the humbler walks of life, is tainted with t h i s l o a t h s o m e m o r a l C o n t a g i o n , t h i s l e p r o s y O f t h e m i n d ; »» d although no human laws can reform the
ivil, although the aeludcrs and deluded are beyond the grasp of legislative enactments, yet they

are within the reach of r i d i c u l e ,

RENTDAY
Founded on Wi/foe's fine Paintings of
" TIw? Bent Day," and " Distraining for Rent!1
" A rich example ot simplicity occurred to delight the audience at Drury Lane,
on one of the Nights during the representation of The Hent Dap. Amidst the pathos
of the ' distraining scene,' when the Farmer was telling the legal harpies, iti the
accents of despair, to TAXE AM., a worthy individual in the Pit started up, and with
the most emphatic commisseration, offered a tSO. note from his own pocket, to stay
the course of proceedings. This burst of mistaken generosity produced no little lensation on the beholders. The enthusiastic philanthropist was, however, pacified ;
and Le.dbe.ter, the officer, was privately stationed in his vicinity, to prevent the
crafty atteinpts; of any possible claimants for the twenty pounds, under the astmmption
of authority from the supposed suffering party."

THE

RENT
Mm

Founded on Wilkies fine Paintings of
" The Rent Day;' and u Distraining for Rent."
"A rich example of simplicity occurred to delight the audience at Dmry Lane,
on one of the Nights during the representation of 7'he Rent Dap. Amidst the pathos
of the ' distraining scene,' when the Farmer was telling the legal harpies, in the
accents of despair, to TAKE ALL, a worthy individual in the Pit started up, and wit
the most emphatic commisseration, offered a £20. note from his own pocket, to stay
the course of proceedings. This burst of mistaken generosity produced no little aensation on the beholders.. The enthusiastic philanthropist was, however, pacified ;
and Leadbeatcr, the officer, was privately stationed in his vicinitv, to prevent the
crafty attempts of any possible claimants for the twenty pounds, under the assumption
of authority from the supposed suffering party."

first appearance here of Mr. HAMILTON, from
the Sheffield Theatre, of Miss MATURIN,
from the NewcastleTlieatre, & Mrs. HOWELL
from the Theatre Royal, York.

On Monday, 4 t h of May, 1835,
Will be acted the celebrated Play of T H E

Stranger:
Or, MISANTHROPY and REPENTANCE.
" Who by Repentance is not satisfied,
" Is not of Heaven or E a r t h . "
The play of the Stranger has rivetted the attention, drawn the tea™, and excited the
applause of the public during many years. A more amiable picture of repentance was
never exhibited on the stage; and of the many who have witnessed this representation,
not one but must have hailed the denoument with the most pleasing emotion.. The
character of tlie Stranger is finely imagined ; he is a misanthrope not by nature, but
by circumstance : he had trusted and had been fatally deceived ; and having suffered
in the very near and dear relations of wife and friend, he became disgusted with mankind, and resolved never to trust m o r e ; his heart, however, is not wholly shut up
Against kindly feelings. His meeting with Mrs. Haller, is very ingeniously contrived,
and the eventual reconciliations is quite consistent with an interview so extraordinary
and interesting.

The main feature* of the story, as pourtrayed in the Novel, are faithfully adhered ta
in the Drama, which opens with a

Scene in David Dean's Cottage
Between the Sisters, Err is and JKANIF, and proceeds progressively to the arrcstand
imprisonment of the former—The interesting interview at midnight between Jeanie
and Staunton, on SALISBURY CRA1G8—From thence the Auditor is led to follow
the younger Sister to her

HER SUBSEQUENT ACCUSATION AND TRIAL FOR CHILD MURDER!!!
As related in the original, is here described by the Characters, and her SENTENCE
OF DE ATI! ! !—To procure the mitigation of which, Jeanie forms the romantic idea
of proceeding on foot to London ; but is interrupted in her progress and detained by
Madge Wildfire and her Mother; the latter of whom declares her determination to
take her life, as she reposes for the night in
A B A R N BY T H E ROAD-SIDE.
By the meansof her daughter Madge, she escapes, and arrives in London ; and through
the interest of the Duke of Argyll, procures an I N T E R V I E W W I T H T H « S
Q U E E N : 'be issue of which being successful, she returns to Edinburgh, where
after encountering many interesting events, arrives just in time to prevent the

EXECUTION, and make known the Innocence of Erne Dean..

" A rich example of simplicity occurred to delight the audience at Drury Lane, on
one of the Nights during the representation of " The Rent Day." Amidit the pathos
of the ' distraining scene,' when the Fanner watt telling the legal harplee in the accent, of despair, to TAKE ALL, a worthy individual in the Pit ttarted up, and with
the meat emphatic commiseration, offered a £90. note from his own pocket, t« way
the course of proceedings. This burst of mistaken generosity produced no little sens*,
tfon on the beholder*. The enthusiastic philanthropist waa, however, pacified; and
Leadbeater, the officer, was privately stationed in hi» vicinity, to prevent the crafty
attempts of any possible claimants for the twenty pound*, under the assumption of
authority from the supposed *uffering party."

Will be acted, Shakspeare's Play of

MACBETH,
KING OF SCOTLAND.

With all the original Music, composed by Locke.
In this grand Play is combined that which is terrific, sublime, and infernal. Spirits are called
from the •* VASTY" DEEP" to give additional horror to the crimes perpetrated. The story of
Macbeth is founded on Scottish history. It was the tragedy of Macbeth that conferred on Shaltspeare the distinguished honour of receiving a letter from his Sovereign's own hand, (James I.), in
testimony of his high approbation of the Work. .Steven,, called this Play, " the first of all dramatic entertainments," and the moral tends to one great and grand precept—" T h o U . h a l t

not Murder."

THE GOLDEN

FARMER,
©ry the aast Crime.
W» should be bad Moralists did we presume to question the efficacy of repentance—
"To lead the wand'rer back who went astray,
To show mankind the error of their way."
is literature applied to its noblest end ; and though popular subjects and a lively
•tyle may be essential to entertain, there is nothing more easy than to make instruction the handmaid of amusement. The story of the Golden Farmer has a two-fold
object; it shows that vice may be reclaimed by the precepts and example of virtue
.—that the felon may hecome a useful member of society by all the powerful influence
of those kindly affections that twine around the heart: and it further shows, that when
the desire of heaping up riches has taken firm possession of ihe mind, the most virtuous resolutions, the deepest contrition, prove but weak barriers against any temptations that may promise to gratify our wishes; and that our only chance to escape is
to call in the aid of contentment, and steadily resist the "busy Devil" that by holding out the delusive prospect of what we may be, makes shipwreck of all that, by the
goodness of Providence, roe are.
This Drama is founded on an incident in the life of an individual denominated the
Golden Farmer, a notorious highwayman, who under the guise 0 f a corn-chandler,
dwelling in Thames Street, whilst exhibiting his packets of barley and oats by day,
made himself acquainted with the contents of the Farmer's pockets, of which he despoiled them by night. By these dishonest means he acquired a considerable sum,
purchased a farm, obtained the title of Golden Farmer, and endeavoured by sincere
repentance and a reformed life to make some atonement for his former misdeeds—but
avarice tempting him into his old course, he is taken, tried, and condemned to death

r. J . F. KAViLLE, in making the present appeal to the Gentry and inhabitants of Derby, begs to
convey his sincere thanks to that portion of the public, whose kind assistance has so materially aided
his humble efforts to revive a taste fur the legitimate Drama in this important Town, and whose
patronage has lessened, what would have otherwise proved, a very serious pecuniary loss to him in
his present undertaking.
Aware of the many difficulties and prejudices with which he has had to
struggle, and may yet have to encounter, Mr. Saville will still endeavour, so to conduct Theatrical
Amusements in Derby, that he may with confidence look forward, when his exertions shall have
been tested by time and public opinion, to more extended patronage and support.

On Wednesday Evening, J a n u a r y 2 9 , 1 8 4 5 ,
The Performance will commence with, by desire, Sir E. L. B.dwe.V popular Play of

Mr. J . F* SAVILLE at the suggestion of numerous Friends, is induced once more to appeal to
that Patronage which has assisted him under many discouraging circumstances in his endeavours
to revive a taste for Theatricals in the town of Derby; it is with feelings of deep gratitude that
Mr. S. begs to acknowledge the support he has received fiom a portion of the Public, and
the considerate kindness of the Press, which combined, have enabled him to overcome many difficulties; still, much remains to be done on the part of the Manager, to secure the confidence and
more extended support of the public, and it is respectfully hoped, that the labours of the pt i
Season may be taken for earnest of increased exertions for the future.

Mr. P begs leave to inform his friends and the Public in general,, that he was very sorry for the disappointment
ifeey met with on. Saturday, through unavoidable circumstanced. He now begs leave to Inform his friends that an
old Favourite of the Derby Plavgoers,

HAS VERY KINDLY OFFERED HIS SERVICES

sriiS . I ;;.• i u i11 s».-.asgs£.is.s.^^

Dramatic Compositions have met with deserved encouragement, and we shall find that they have ever be.®
esteemed, by the greatest and wisest men, as the most excellent productions of human genius, and highly serviceable
to the cause of virtue. It is desirable that the exhibition of Dramatic Performance should not be neglected, "The common
business of Hfe too intensely pursued makes men unmindful of the precepts and maxims of virtue, which they are
more apt to forget in the eager pursuits of their avocations than to abandon through want of principle, The Drama
awakens them to virtue, exercises all the kinder emotions, and, by its influence over the mind and feelings, prevents
that moral Stagnation which often tends to degrade and brnoTy ; and yet the stage is a place on which the PHARISEES
OP THIS WORLD look down with contempt! Innocent recreation has been, by the most able Professors of morality
and discipline, considered an effective spur to the youthful mind, when judiciously applied, in moments of relaxation
from the graver intricacies of the arts, sciences., or other branches of education. From the ordinary occupations of life
to unbend the attention to light objects of amusement, may give a zest that can increase application, and be more
profitable thai the solitary pleasure of seclusion, or the more open dissipations of life. Public Entertainments are but
too often conducted in a manner regardless of the morals of the visitors, and thereby many persons of particular sects
or moral character, entirely absent themselves from public entertainments ; to meet such objections, it is the present
intention to produce a series of Dramatic Representations at once astonishing and recreative; and so cautious will be
the selection, that modesty wilt tiever be excited to blush by any Exhibition within the Theatre. In all part* of
England die Company has been honoured with the highest approbation from truly respectable audiences.

that they were frequently the theme of laudatory rhymes, and those who paid the dea/est for his pranks, were often tb.

BELL,

This Melo Drama is founded on a tale of terror. The Bell Rock, or Inchcape Rock, as it is more commonly designated by mariners, is a Sunken Hock off the North East Coast of Scotland, and was formerly
very dangerous to Sailors ; the Abbots of Aberbrothocli or Aberbrothwick, a religous foundation, standing
near the Coast, caused a large Bell to be erected on the float near to the Rock, so as to ring by the agitation
of the Sea, and by this simple means to indicate to the bewildered Seaman, the perilous situation in which he
was placed. The Bell was cut from the Float, and the person who committed this nefarious act, afterwards
met his fate by Shipwreck on this very Rock, during a dark and stormy night.

The Eddystone Lighthouse is not only a stupendous monument of the ingenuity of man, but of his forethought and
piiilanthrophy. A beacon to the mariner whose home is on the deep, lashed by an ever foaming surge, echoing to the
howling winds, and looking proud defiance on lightning and tempest, well may it awaken strange and melancholy thoughts
in the bosoms of its solitary inhabitants, [t has been truly remarked, that the sailor is prone to superstition : and if ever
a scene was more peculiarly fitted to conjure up that dark and fearful spirit, it is this pillar of fire, rising in lonely majesty amidst the wide waste of waters.

The Tell of the Tyrol.

A N D R E A S H O F E R has been justly called " T h e Tell of the Tyrol," for, like his great exemplar, h*
planned and for a while effected, the liberation of his country. He is a hero of our own time, and, as such
deserves peculiar honor. No motive of self-aa;°.randiseti.et.t was his spring of action—he had neither prejudice
to indulge, revenge to satiate, or ambition to gratify ;—he stood forth unshackled as his countrv's deliverer,
and died the glorious and unspotted patriot that he had lived. Tell aud Hofer are heroes well adapted forthe
stage—they are worth an hundred Alexanders and Cassars—tbey enlist our sympathies on the right side, and
make us feelthat we are men.

The Tell of the Tyrol.
A N D R E A S H O F E R has been justly called " The Tell of the Tyrol," for, like his great exemplar, he
'ilanned and for a while effected, the liberation of his country. He is a hero of our own time, and, as such,
deserves peculiar honor. No motive of self-aggrandisement was his spring of action—he had neither prejudice
to indulge, revenge to satiate, or ambition to gratify ;—he stood forth unshackled as his country's deliverer,
and died the glorious and unspotted patriot that he had lived. Tell and Hofer are heroes well adapted for the
stage—they are worth an hundred Alexanders and Csesars—they enlist our sympathies on the right side, and
make us feelthat we are men.

It is wise thus to infuse the amor patrie into our amusements :—-though now dwelling in Peace, the trumpet of 'war

The Tell of the Tyrol.
ANDREAS HOPEU has been justly called " t h e Tell pf the Tyrol," for, like his great exemplar, he
planned and for a while effected, the liberation of his country. He is a hero of our own time, and, as such
deserves peculiar honor. No motive of self-aggrandisement was his spring of action—he had neither
prejudice to indulge, revenge to satiate, or ambition to gratify ;—he stood forth unshackled as his country's
deliverer, and died the glorious and unspotted patriot that he had lived. Tell and Hofer are heroes well
adapted for the stage. They are worth an hundred Alexanders and Ciesars—they enlist our sympathies
on the right side, and make us feel that we are men.

On MONDAY Evening, November 21st, 1 8 3 0 ,
Will be presented a New Domestic Drama, called

T H E MAID

OF
THIAMIN;
Or the Story of a Rear!.
7

The plot of this piece is taken from a Tale by LyttoH Bulwer, in the •' Pilgrims of the Rhine," and occupies a very
prominent place in that beautiful Work. It was originally produced at the English Opera House, and perhaps a better
panegyric cannot be pronounced upon it, than that it was most cordially received by the Easter visitors (on a night when
Dramas of an opposite character are usually given,) without the aid of retributive red flame, a discriminating'cataract,
or the poetical justice of a trap-door.

when obliged b y stage necessity, a n d h a s never resorted to his o w n l a n g u a g e when he could avail himself
of t h a t of the novelist.
Of lonely folk cut off unseen,
Two sudden blows with a rugged stick,
And hid in sudden graves;
And one with a heavy stone,—
Of horrid stabs in groves forlorn,
One hurried gash with a hasty knife,
And murders done in caves.
And then the deed was done.

On T U E S D A Y Evening, March 7th, 183T,
Will be presented the admired interesting Domestic Tragedy, called

FATAL
CURIOSITY;
OR THE

ShlpwrecLea

Son.

The scene of this highly-interesting Domestic Drama is laid in Cornwall, and the subject chosen by the A uthor is one
highly wrought to nvet the attention and touch the feelings of an audience. The son, having been abroad for seven!
years, and endured various hardships, is shipwrecked, and visits his native t.hore in disguise, to ascertain if his love is still
true to him. H e learns his Father and Mother are in the greatest distress, and resolves to visit them in his assumed
character,—being fatigned, he retires to rest, leaving in their hands a casket of great value. Their poverty overcoming
their qualms of conscience, they resolve on murdering the rich stranger, as they term him, and appropriate his wealth to
their owu use, which horrid purpose they effect, and thus the son is sacrificed by the avaricious parent when on the point
of uniting himself to his betrothed, and placing them beyond the reach of want.—The Father yields himself to despair
and, in an agony of remorse, avenges his son's death on himself.

TICKET NIGHT.
On T H U R S D A Y Evening, March 9 t h ,
Will be presented the highly interesting Nautical Drama, called the

INCH-CAPE
This melodrama, or, in the modern phrase, Nautical Drama, is founded on a tale of terror The Bell Rock or " Inch
Cape Hock," as it is more commonly designated by mariners, is a sunken rock off the north-east coast of Scotland, and
•was formerly very dangerous to sailors. The abbots of Aberbrothock, or Aberbrothwick, a religious foundation, standing
near the coast, caused a large bell to be erected on the float near the rock, so as to ring by the agitation of the sea, and
by this simple means to indicate to the bewildered seaman the perilous situation in which he was placed. There is a
tradition current amongst the inhabitants of the coast, that the bell was cut from the float, and stolen, and that the person
who committed this nefarious act afterwards met his fate by ship-reck on this very rock, during a dark and stormy night.
Ou this tradition Mr, Ball has founded his piece, which is judiciously chosen for dramatic interest and effect.

No motive of self-aggrandisement was his spring of action—he had neither prejudice to indulge, revenge to satiate, or
ambition to gratify;—he stood forth unshackled as his country's deliverer, and died the glorious and unspotted patriot

OR THE DESOLATE ISLAND.
Of all the popular tales intended for dramatic representation, none can rivet the attention of the spectator more than
those composed of a nautical Subject. I n ' Perouse1 are faithfully pourtrayed the perils of the dann<r mariner • we bear
the rushing of the ocean, the striking of the ship, and the cry of the drowning seaman, till it becomes almost reality ;
while the sequel gratihes us by proving that Providence is ever watchful, and in the storm or desert.

" A sweet little cherub sits smiling aloft.
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.''

The chief Incidents of this Drama are, fimt,where the Hero is discovered in one of his abstracted moods, having wandered into the bye paths of a
Forest adjoining his Camp, the night previous to one of

BONAPARTE'S CELEBRATED BATTLES.
Here he encounters an old Soldier of the Imperial Array, who driven to desperation by the destruction of his father's cottage, and starvation of ' his
family in consequence of the ravages of the Emperor's troops, demands his money.
Napoleon, touched with pity for his situation, and having no coin,
has just given him hi. watch, when another pamenger arriving, and perceiving what he imagines a robbery oa foot, rushes forward to sei.e the delinquent,
who, finding hi. danger, is about to fire at the stranger, when the Emperor, with that instinctive courage for which he was so famed, throws himself
txfore the body of the old man, and while preserving him at the hazard of hi. own life, yet urges the flight of the other. H e is next unconciou.ly, led

NAPOLEON'S

OPINION

OF THE

Is freely expressed, and at the same time happly contrasted with the difference from the French Nation. The watch is recognized by the officer, and
the whole party arrested. The Emperor suffers himself to be taken to head ,.rt»rters, that he may have the opportunity of rescuing the unfortunate
soldier. They are overtaken by a tremendous storm, which obliges them to take shelter in the very hut—bearing all the ravaging and destructive mark*
of war—belonging to the Swiss who attacked him, and as the poor fellow is about to be shot, throwing his disguise off

parallel. The adapter, Mr. Fitzball, author of Jonathan Bradford, Bronze Morse, Paul Clifford, fyc, has only deviated from

has effected his escape. The scene now represents

Juan enters, followed by Scaramouch, who directs the attention of his Master to the Monument.
Juan in derision invites the Statue to Supper.

The Monumental Statue suddenly becomes Animated,
And to the horror of the Libertine, accepts the invitation. Juan recovers his courage, and defies the Spectral Effigy, when
the Tomb is Supernaturally Illuminated, and exhibits the following inscription in Letters of blood:
By thee I fell tby fate's decreed, | Heaven will avenge the Bloody deed.
The progress of the Ballet now conducts to

A S P L E N D I D SALOON In the Mansion of DON JUAN !
The Appearance of the Spectral Statue of the Governor at the Feast.

FIRST N I G H T
Of the Celebrated

YOUTHFUL TRAGEDIAN,

MRG.OWEN
Who is engaged for a Few Nights, and will make *~4s
First Appearance these 5 Years in

E.rtrucl fruia the Theatrical Chronicle, Loiitfon.
. " Probably since the days of the great Master Betty, no person has created so much sensation in the
circles in which he has appeared, as the Young Gentleman whose name figures at the head of this article.
The developement of genius in a young mind must ever be an interesting study, and we shall therefore
make no apology for introducing to our readers this individual, who has by his talents secured a degree of
fame in the highest walks of a difficult profession. On the 12th of December, 18.2,'j, at 129, Strand, the
subject of the present memoir, Mr, GEORGE OWEN, was born, and early evincing a disposition for the
Stage, on the 12th of July, 1837, made his first appearance at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham ; although
his success was immense, he did not make his Second Appearance for eight months, viz., at the Newcastle
Theatre, on the 6th of March. The applause with which he was received was beyond all precedent ? his
age and the nice discrimination he displayed in developing even the little points in the characters he undertook, at once stamped him as the ' R o c I u s OF THE DAY.' It was not to be imagined that rumour
with her thousand tongues would be long in wafting to the Metropolis the name of a child possessing such
extraordinary talents. Mr. Davidge hearing of his fame, tendered him an engagement, and on the 13th of
November, 1838, he made his first bow to a London audience, at the Surrey Theatre, in the Character of
Young Norval, he being the first juvenile who had appeared since the days of Young Burke ; the house
was all expectation. The surprising powers which he possessed, carried all before him, and in the fifth act
the house rose EN MASSE, and greeted him with applause. At the close of his Engagement, he was retained expressly for the Character of Oliver Twist, which was produced on the 19th, and repeated that character for nearly One Hundred and Fifty Nights. As a Shaksperian Actor, he is possessed of talents of
the first-rate order. The provincial Press has been lavish in its praise of him, and we can only add our
testimony to his abilities by saying, that they have in every respect been Deserved."

The Performance will commence with the admired Play in 5 Acts, entitled

The Conspiracy
From the Kendal Mercury, November 28th, 1846.—" THEATRE ROYAL, ULVERSTON.
Mr,
GEORGE OWKN has created a perfect furor amongst the critics in Ulverston, by his masterly
delineations of Shakspeare's heroes. Modernj authors have also been effectively reflected by
this youthful but accomplished " mirror of nature." In accordance with the universal wish, our
respected manager (Daly) re-engaged him, and on Tuesday we had the pleasure of seeing him
as Richelieu for the second time. This character is decidedly one of his best efforts. He depicted the infirm old man to the life, while his outbreaks of choler were not too boisterous (too
common a fault amongst the players of the present day). He gave the sarcastic speeches with
inimitable ease and point, while the outpourings of his oppressed heart, in the fourth act, were
affectingly natural, and many " water-standing eyes" gave conclusive testimony of the triumph
of this young Actor's art."
