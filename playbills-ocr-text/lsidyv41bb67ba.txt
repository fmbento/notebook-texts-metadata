Or, The- Deserts of Siberia.

ie subject of this Piece is founded oo an historical fact, which occurred in the Russian
The
ire, _.
and has since been translated into English, forming the interesting Novel of " $lhaEmpire,
belh; or The Kxile of Siberia," from -.hicb this Play is taken. No imagination could have
formed actions sp heroic, sentiments so noble.—the heart alone could haVc inspired them. The
daughter who conceived the glorious design of delivering a father from Exile, and carried it
into execution, in defiance of intercepting mountains of snow, really existed ; and Alexina
holds up to you'Jia rare example of filial piety—shows what a child, dutiful, affectionate, and
enterprising,"is capable of performing in the service of a parent.

On Tuesday Evening, February 3rd, 1824,
Will be revived the celebrated Tragedy of

OROOMOKO;
Or, The Royal

Slave.

The melancholy story of this unfortunate Prioce, cannot fail to excite compassion inevery sensitive and feeling auditor; it not only conveys a strong idea of the galling
miseries under which the unhappy victims of the Slave Trade are forced to suborn, but
;it the same time rouses the honest indignation of every beholder, at the instruments of
such ignominious wrongs.
" Can nature be silent, tchan o'er my sad plains,
Poor Africa, my sons still in Slavery mourn ?
Can sorrow but weep, when such tyranny reigns,
O'er the freedom of those who for liberty burn."

Robinson Crusoe;
•.

Or, The JBofd JBuctearieers.
As performed at the Tbeatre-RoyaJ, Covent-Garden, upwards of a wbole-Set^dn, witti the mosi
tmqaalitled approbation.
This truly interesting Piece is founded on the weH-kaonn history of that unfortunate rat:gator who lived so many years on an Island, without any society save that of his faithful NWi
Friday, whose life he saved from Canibals.
Tbe Drama commences with the daily avocation'
of Crusoe and Friday, in constructing a Canoo, fur hi* escape frntt the Ishwd P.iriboo.'
Cannibal Chief, accompanied by Iris pfcrty. arrives at the Island, with Igli.fr. the Fatt.*'*
Friday, to sacrifice trim, behaving been taken in battle. Friday recognises bis Father, aid
through the assistance of Crusoe, rescues him—compels them to abandon their purpose, 'D'
quit tbe Island, Which tbey do, leaving Pariboo behind, who vows vengeance against them "*"
Crusoe. Diego the Son, and Ines the Wife of Crusoe, anxious for his fate, set forward in'
Ship, in hopes to learn tidings of him : In the course of tbe voyage, a mutiny springs up m
board, at tbe instigation of Windlass, tbe Boatswain, and Swivel the Gunner, who resolves!'
put Diego, their Captain, and his Mother, on shore. Harry Bluff, an English Seaman, refus"
to assist, and is decreed to be left with thetn—He meets with Crusoe, recognizes him, and d.
tannines, with tbe assistance of a party of Iglou's upon quelling the mutiny, and rescuing Die-1
and Ines. After many interesting situations, hairbreadth escapes, and combats, tbey acco-'

killing Pariboo, who had actively sought to destroy bim The Mutineers arc punished am
doomed to remain on the Island, whilst Crusoe ami hrs happ, family, accompanied by Frida.1
and his Father, leave i t ; thus proving that a just reliance in Providence, cannot tail »f jreaei'ing revfard., hert «rnd hereafter.
