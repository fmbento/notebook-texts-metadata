SO" The Publick are refpectfully informed that
Miss O'NEILL
Is so much Indisposed with a SUDDEN & VIOLENT COLD, that it is the Opinion of her Physician, that had she attempted to perform this night, her Recovery (which now it is hoped will be speedy) might have been retarded for a long period of time. The Managers are therefore sure that they but obey the wishes of her Friends and Admirers, in not allowing her to expose herself to such imminent Danger, they have therefore changed the Performances to tile revived Opera of The
Maid of the Mill.
