Marfyn Lcssamour, (the seventh husband,) entertaining some suspicion of the fate of the others, lias recourse to artifice to detect the mystery, and is successful in the attempt. History records that In r*>®sequence of that discovery, the bodies of the »ix husband* were dug op ; and ns »arks of violence were still di-cernable on each of them—evidence so strong and circumstantial brought on the condemnation of Margaret j and at Smithfield, for sorcery and murder she perished at the «take. These events of course are not depicted in the Drama. To them however is England indebted for that wise and noble regulation, by which a body never interred without the legal inspection of a Coroner’s Inquest.

most as one of the Author’s happiest productions. The Characters abound with humour, and are drawn in a masterly manner, yet not over-stepping-the modesty .of nature. The ever happy Adam Brock, blunt, honest, and humane, a Joker, a Smoker, and laughing Philosopher to boot; the officious intermeddling Triptolemus Muddlework; a shallow busy Burgomaster, whose brain is an everlasting Magazine of Plots, Conspiiacies, and Chimeras dire; he sees in the most trivial events something re-maiK.ti.bIc i not a pudding can be boiled but there is treason in the smoke j excites more than usual merriment. The character of Charles, is maintained with spirit and propriety, lus short questions and quick answers are in perfect keeping with the historical picture of that taciturn Monarch. The difficulties and perilous situations Major Vamberg and his Daughter Ulrica encounter, render them objects of particular interest; Eudiga, the Daughter of Adam Brock is like her Farther, always happy and striving to do good. The interest excited is continued throughout, the conclusion the most satisfactory, and the mural conveyed well worth imitation. ! /y,^	'	J

The various writers of Europe luve'cuvcluped the History of FAUST, or FAUSl’US, one of the first inventors of the glorous Art of Printing, in a cloud of Demoniacal Mystery, Geoffery of Motnnuuih has dwelt at large on the internal agency hy which his plans were presumed to have been formed and txecuted. Tradition, nursed by Superstition, has spread, with wild and extravagant additions, the romantic adventures of this singular Philosopher. It is from the extraordinary legend, produced by the Pen of the celebrated Goethe, that the present play is drawn. It is from Uetz’s wonderful illustrations of that work, that the leading figures start before the amazed eye in palpable and animated existence, and Faustus, surrounded by Demons, ranges through his Limited Career, perpetrating Crime after Crime, till the awful close of his

“ THE FLYING DUTCHMAN” is said to he an Amsterdam Vessel, which ahoutaCentury ago sailed from that Port;— ttie Master’s Name was Vanderdecken, whose constant boast it was, that “he always would have his own way, in spite o. Fate.”—Once, on doubling the Cape, they were a whole day trying to weather Table Bay, the wind increasing a-head of them, and Vanderdecken walking the Deck, continued sweating tearlully—just after sun-set, he was spoke by a Vessel, who asked if he did not mean to go into the Bay that night; to which Vanderdecken, with a tremendous oath, replied, " he woulp not, though he should beat about till the Day of Judgment.” Vanderdecken never did go into Table Bay, and is believed to undergo the doom he so desperately dared. Ilis Vessel is still seen in the Cape Seas in foul weather, sailing against the fiercest storm, with every inch of canvas set, striving in vain to reach her home, or to send despatches to relatives by other
Vessels.-The hints upon which the Drama is founded, were taken from a short and interesting Article in Blackwood's

The various writers of Europe have enveloped the History of FAUST, or FAUSl'US, one of the first inventors of the glorous Art of Printing, in a cloud of Demoniacal Mystery. Geoffery of Monmouth has dwelt at large on the infernal agency by which his plans were presumed to have been formed and executed. Tradition, nursed by Superstition, has spread, with wild and extravagant additions, the romantic adventures of this singular Philosopher. It is from the extraordinary legend, produced by the Pen of the celebrated Goethe, that the present play is drawn. It is from Retz’s wonderful illustrations of that work, that the leading figures start before the amazed eye in palpable and animated existence, and Faustus, surrounded by Ominous, ranges through his Limited Career, perpetrating Crime alter Crime, till the awlul close ol his
DESPERATE COMPACT.

The Anaconda is supposed to be the largest species of the Bua Constrictor tribe. Ilo&k, the Roman Historian, speaks of it as follows*• Regains, in the progress of his conquests, encamping on the hanks of the Bragrada, a river that discharges itself into the sea, not far from Carthage, is said by many authors to have met there with a monstrous Serpent, 01 190 feet long, which muilt infested his army, seizing his men, and swallowing them whole, when they went to draw water. The skin of this animal was so tough, and its scales su thick, as to he impenetrable by (lie Roman weapons, insomuch that they were lotted to employ tlieir haltering engines to destroy it.”—This Piece was originally written for Mr. Brvmton, and was produced hy him ill London wilh the greatest success. All attempt will he made in ihe last scene to shew the Munster and Its hahils. 1 he Anaconda will he produced on the Stage, where it attacks the Pavilion in which Seafield and his Sou are concealed ; seizes a Buffalo, driven there fur that (special purpose, and is finally overcome aud destroyed.	<

To conclude with ihe New Domestic Drama of The

“ In 1772," says a History of the Reign ot George I. “ the pariizans of ihe Smart Family began once more to bestir themselves, in the supposition, doubtless, that the shock produced by the failure of the Soinh Sea project would lie favourable to their designs. The measures of Government, however, were so judicious and prompt, that the Conspiracy was crushed in embryo.” Upon this Hint the Author has “ taken out” the allowed Dramatic Licence to fix on an Historical circumstance as the means of developing Imaginary events, and produced a Comedy which was performed at the Theatre-Kuyal, Hayinarket, during the greater part of last Summer with very great applause.

The BRIGAND
Alessandro JVIassaroni, the Italian Rohin Hood, was one of those daring spirits that seem to have been created to correct the unequal distribution of good and evil. Chief of a lawless hand, his name spread terror throughout Italy. Like the famous freebooter of merry England, he mingled mirth with his malefaction; and those who paid the dearest fur his pranks were often the first to laugh at his humour. He was certainly a very gentlemanly Brigand, full of chivalry and romance.

He was certainly a very gentlemanly Brigand, full of chivalry and romance.

Can only be equalled by the joy his miraculous escape from THE MIIjIi OF KE8EN affords even his Enemies. Magnanimous conduct of the Miller in effecting the ESCAPE of TEKELI.

AUGUST Stitli and Smil, 1844,
Will be produced, for the First Time in Swansea, a new, pathetic, and interesting domestic Drama,
in three acts, called
OR THE
Tv lain and Ficissitudes of a Servant Girl!
Embracing situations of such deep and poweiful interest !—of such supernatural and startling effects!—and of such solemn and impressive appeals to the besl feeling of human nature!—as to render the thrilling anxiety of the spectator more intense and more strong at its representation, than can be remembered ever to have occurred within the walls of a Theatre ! ! !
Why despise the “ short and simple Annals of the Poor ?” amomg which ivill be found some of the most Interesting Events and heart-rending Scenes in Real Life, more truly touching to the sense, and more truly speaking to the heart, than all the pompous tales of “ Lordlye Knight and Ladyc fair.” Alas ! how little do the Rich, revelling in wealth and luxury, know of the cares and troubles, the miseries and deprivations under which the Poor labour ; and yet behold their patient suffering! In this Drama, the fearful Dream of Susan Hopley—the subsequent Vision—and the account of the Murder at the Old Manor House, are subjects of thrilling interest!—Whilst the Servant Girl’s Departure from the Home of her Childhood, and her Extraordinary Adventures in London, which eventually lead to the Discovery of the Murderers, render this Domestic Drama one of the most powerfully interesting ever yet brought forward to public notice.

HARLEQUIN
SINEAD,
VHe Old Man of the	.
The Wizard Ocenno, surnamed the Old Man of the Sea, having sworn to the Demon of the Red Sea to immolate a human victim upon his Altar at every change of the Moon, is thereby enabled to subdue Parazaide, the Fairy of the Golden Island, and confining her for ever in a crystal vase, reigns undisputed Lord of the Island, practising every cruelty upon the unfortunate travellers who land upon its shores. An English vessel is wrecked upon the Island, and all on board perish with the exception of Marian, who falls into the Wizard’s power—Enamoured of the Girl, Oceano wishes to preserve her life, and is anxiously seeking for another victim whom he may sacrifice upon the altar of the Demon of the Red Sea, when Sinbad falls into his power; at this the Pantomime commences. Sinbad is discovered sleeping, and awakes just in time to be too late, for he perceives the Vessel in which he had visited the fatal coast leaving the Island. Abandoned by his companions, the unlucky mariner falls into the power of Oceano, and is led to the Mystic Cavern of the old Man of the Sea. Here the Wizard, aided by the Monster Malico, chains the unhappy Sinbad to a rock, and is endeavouring to prevail upon the captive Marian to listen to his suit, when he is reminded by the Gigantic Head of the Demon of the Crimson Sea, that the moment approaches when he must render up the stipulated victim, or the Fairy Parazaide will regain her liberty, Oeeano determines that Sinbad shall perish; but failing in his foul design, the Fairy of the Golden Island escapes from the Magic Vase, and transforming the uuhappy prisoners into the motley Hero and Heroine of Pantomime, aids their escape from the Enchanted Island. The Demon of the Red Sea, reluctant to lose his victims, changes Oceano and Malico into the slippered Pantaloon and fantastic Clown, dispatching them in pursuit of the Lovers.- The view holloa is given—the game started—and Harlequin breaking cover, runs his annual round of “ Moving Accidents by Flood and Field.”
