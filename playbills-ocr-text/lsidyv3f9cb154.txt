ADDRESS,
' Spoken by Miss KELLY,
AT THE OPENING OF THE
THE A TRE ROYAL, DRURY LANE. October 4, 1819.
Tho’ Fiction here asserts her ancient reign,
We claim, a moment, her infring’d domain :
Truth’s high commission to this court I bear,
Her genuine dictates, and her purpose fair,
Whom now she advocates, you long have tried— Encourag’d long his emulative pride;
The pride you love!—and he, exulting, says,
You ne’er deserted whom you deign’d to raise!
“ Early to win your smiles that pride aspir’d ;
Early those smiles his grateful bosom fir’d ;
“ O’er the young germ your genial breezes blew,
“ And with the growing plant your kindness grew.
“ Various his toil, but constant to his cause,
“ You nurs’d the wish to merit your applause
Actor or manager, he still enjoy’d
The boon for which you saw his zeal employ’d.
Flush’d by your sanction, dauntless now he dares To magnify his labours and his cares ;
At Atlas’ challeng’d strength the glove hath hurl'd ;
His load a pond’rous, tlio’ a mimic world.
The Magi say, (who Nalure’s secrets track1!
This planet’s pois’d upon a camel’s back!
Ask’d what the bearer stays, their wisdom’s pos’d;	.
That seeret, orient science ne’er disclos’d :—
More happy he whose world now courts your view ; Ask’d what sustains his strength, he points to vor.
“ That stiength the fmit of seasons twice fifteen,
‘ May fail of fulness, but it is not green ;—
“ Or grant it crude, your beams inav yet unfold “ The latent hue, and turn the green to gold.”
Where first your well-plac’d laurels Kemble wore;
IV here Siddon’s, Jordan’s brows your chaplets bore; Where Pritchard’s pathos bade your fathers thrill,
And Garrick’s magic witch’d them at his will;
Where resting theirs on more exalted pow’rs,
Round Shakspeare’s sovereign stem they wreath’d their flowers,
“ Where Histrionic Homage rear’d a shrine To public bounty and a bard divine There he the warm devout oblation brings,
Of all that from admiring ardour springs ;
All that the sense of present duty fires,
All that imprinted patronage inspires.
On pure intent ambitious to depend,
To no bye-path his spirit will descend :
The plain, broad road of candour is his course,
The Drama’s honor his propel ling force.
Would Comic Wit her attic summit climb ?
Or Frolic Farce ? Or Tragedy sublime?
Is Oral skill a candidate for fame ?
Doth Vocal Excellence prefer her claim ?
All Real Pretension will be welcom’d here, .
And Taste and Genius find their free career.
This his just plan, expectantly he sues The confidence his faith will ne’er abuse.
Courting at large the talent of the age,
No fear he owns for his in partial stage.
A lib'ral system your support ensures :
Merit he hails !—and Merit’s cause is Yovrs.
N B. The lines with inverted Commas were omitted in consequence the length of the addicts.

TO THE PUBLIC.
The Managers most respectfully inform the Patrons of this Theatre, that in consequence of an Accident, which the GENTLEMAN who performed HAMLET, yesterday Evening, met with at his rehearsal, and the mental agitation which his first appearance before a London Audience created, he feels totally unable to attempt the repetition of the Character this Evening. Under a circumstance so distressing, the most prompt measures were taken to prevent further disappointment by the alteration of the Play, and they earnestly hope, that the endeavours of
Mr. HAMBLIN,
who has, at a very short notice undertaken the Character, will meet with that favourable reception which is usually shown on occasions of a similar urgency.

REVIVAL OP
Ring Lear.
The success of this unequalled production of our immortal BardA has exceeded the best. expectation8 which tiie Management had indulged; and which expectations induced the Proprietor to sanction any expense either as to the engagement of particular Talent, Costume, Oecoiations, or Scenic effect, it is now announced to the
Decoi
which are in succession o any revival.
twenty-second Night, nineteen of a circumstance unparalleled in the history of the Stage, in Yespect
Mr. KEAN
fja3 sostaind his brilliancy in the matchless efforts of his art, by bis personification of
KING LEAR,
which is allowed, by the best Critics of the day, to be h s masterpiece; and the Performers ir general, animated by such an example, have entered with enthusiasm into the apirit and sublime pathos of the Poet, and endeavoured to produce a perfect representation.
The PIT is nightly filled at the First Price ; and the DRESS BOXES are greatly engaged up to the 22d night, in consequence of which,
The ORCHESTRA
has been opened for the Public accommodation, and seats may be engaged in it, when the
Dress Circle is filled.	.
KING LEAR will be performed every night for the remainder of the week; and the following Performances will take place in the ensuing week:	„
Monday, May 15, KING LEAR.

Which was received on its first representation with tumultuous Applause, and stopped by

VIRGIN1US,
Or, the Fall of the Decemviri.
In which Mr. KEAN will sustain the principal Character.
N. B. A practice has prevailed at this Theatre, of engaging whole Dress Boxes, and the parties having engaged them, frequently neglect to send notice of their absence on the Evening; or, if they come, bring only four or five persons to a Box, which holds thirteen. At any time such conduct is ungenerous; but in a title of popularity, similar to the present, ¡t is unjust to the Public, many of whom are, by this, perhaps unintended seclusion, disappointed of honouring ¡he Theatre on a particular night. It is, therefore, most respectfully requested, that the absolute number of Places wanted may be declared at the time a Dre*s Sox is engaged.

The Public '
Is most respectfully informed, that in consequence of a severe Accident which happened to
Mr. K E A i\,
last Night, during his exertions in the Afterpiece, by which he ruptured a considerable portion of the muscular flesh appertaining to the calf of his leg, he will be unable to resume his professional labours for some time. The StageManager is in possession of a medical Certificate from Mr. CARLISLE, the Surgeon ; and it is confidently hoped, that the exertions of
Mr. R A E,
in the pari of Reuben Glenroy, will be received with that indulgence, which his kindness in undertaking the character at so yerv short a notice, entitle him to.

FOR yrHE BENEFIT OF
T. RODWELL,
__	BOX-BOOK KEEPER.
T. RODWELL respectfully informs the NOBILITY, GENTRY, and PUBLIC, that his
■	DB Si! IS IF HIP
IS FIXED FOR
SATURDAY, JULY the 8th, 1820,
WHEN
VARIOUS ENTERTAINMENTS,
Will be given, in, which
Mr. ELLISTON, Mr. MUNDEN, Mr. DO WTON, Mr. KNIGHT,
And Madame VESTRIS will appear.
§5* Tickets and Places to be taken of T. RODWELL, at the Box-Office.
T. RODWELL in announcing his ANNUAL BENEFIT, begs leave respectfully to guard his Friends and the Public against the insidious Means employed in the last Season, and repeated in the present, to deprive him of the only remuneration he can obtain for his attention to the duties of his office.
It is necessary to observe, that the situation is without salary, and therefore the reward of his services must depend altogether on the produce of the Benefit to which he is entitled ; that he holds the appointment for a term of years, and, has deposited the sum of £2,GOO as a security for the correct discharge of its duties, which, he trusts, he has fulfilled to the universal satisfaction of the very numerous audiences who have this season honored Drury Lane Theatre with their presence.
1 he following Circular, though dated the 8th June, has been long and widely distributed.
“ Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Private Box Office, 8th June, 1820.
“ I presume to acquaint you that my Annual Benefit is fixed.
“ On this very particular occasion I most respectfully solicit your kind patronage and protection.
“ I trust and hope in the execution of your various commands, you- are satisfied every exertion has been used to merit your countenance and support.
“ I have the honor to be, with the highest respect,
“ Your very obedient humble Servant,
“ SAMUEL SPRING.
“ N.B, The bearer respectfully waits you commands, who can supply you with tickets and places.”
The above will show" the unw orthy means that have been resorted to, for the purpose of misleading the Public, and depriving the fair Claimant of their patronage upon this and former occasions; and they will be enabled to appreciate the nature of the injury more correctly, when they understand that there is no distinction between Public and Private Boxes, as far as their superintendence is concerned.
The appointment of T. R. comprehends the whole, and that the person, of whose unjust dealing he
complains, has no concern,directly or indirectly, with any thing relating to the Box department.
