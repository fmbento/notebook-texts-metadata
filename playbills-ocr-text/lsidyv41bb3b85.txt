TELL-J

NOR THEN BERBERS
HERO OF SWITZERLAND.
TELL, the Patriot of Switzerland, is placed iu situations, by the author, the most heart-rending; nor
does the young scion that springs from this noble stock, call for a less meed of praise. We behold him,
at the parental command, in dead of night, crossing the almost unpassable mountains of Switzerland—
" That wear their caps of snow,
In very presence of the regal Sun."
And when his Father, at the command of the tyrant Gesler, is about to suffer death, his constancy in
denying him, though only warned by a look, excite, our wonder; but when the tyrant proffers pardon
to both, on condition that Tell shall shoot an apple on the head of his own child—The fortitude with
•which the youth hears the proposal, and prepares for the trial of his parent's skill—the agony of t h .
father, lest he should murder his boy
is a climax of theatrical personation which no other author ha.
introduced on the stage

MR CLIFFORD.
Mr CLIFFORD begs to inform the Nobility, Gentry, and Public generally
>f Kington and its vicinity, that he has fitted up and entirely renovated this neat
md commodious Theatre, in which every possible attention will be paid to the
onvenience of the visitors.
During the Season, which can extend but for a short
oeriod, (the Manager's engagements to visit other provincial towns being imperative) the most celebrated productions of our most talented and popular author.,
•vill be presented in the most rapid succession, aided by appropriate Scenery,
Dresses, Decorations^ &c. and delineated by Performers of acknowledged talent;
the whole conducted on a scale of propriety which the Manager flatters himself
annot fail to meet with general approbation.
En these days of improvement, when societies for thetrircnlation of literature,
sciences, and arts, are spreading with such irresistible rapidity, and undeniable
advantages, little need be said in recommendation of the Stage to Public Notice;
Tor, in addition to its being one of the best schools for Morality, it possesses a fourfold advantage—in amusing the learned—instructing the ignorant—confounding
>he guilty—and rewarding the virtuous. " T o hold as t'were the Mirror u p to Nature, to shew virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and
body of the time its form and pressure". Surely then the Stage which has so many qualities in its favour, and so highly patronized by our Most Gracious Majesty
I'he QUEEN, and all the ROYAL FAMILY, cannot fail to receive support front
«he most enlightened classes of the 19th century.

BARNWELL)
Olt

S

I R E LONDON APPRENTICE.

t h i s affecting Tragedy (the moral tendency of which has been so benifioial to the rising generation) m
founded m foot. The unfortunate hero of the Piece was, in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, executed for
the murder of his virtuous and venerabl Uncle, to which he was instigated by an artful, cj-ael, and abtwv
doned woman. Stop by step she led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable
existence by a moat ignominious death.
A story i. reported, and the fact can l>c proved by many living witnesses, that a young gentleman ol
the City of London, having embezzled part of his master's property, was providentially (at the representation of George Barnwell, at Drary Lane, when the admirable actor Mr- Moss, prsonated Georgt
Barnwell,) so struck with the fate of Barnwell, that it occassioned his immediate contrition and reformation
The Gentlemen so benefited by this excellent Tragedy, was Mi ashamed to own his obligation to the Play,
and the Performer, for at every subsequent yearly benefit M r Moss, received a Hundred Pounds sterling,
with a card to the following effect: —
Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, for more than
life-for his redeemed honour and credit—begs your acceptance of the enclosed, which sum you
will receive yearly as long as you continue in your profession. Happy am I to acknowledge that
the Stage has presrved me from ruin and disgrace. George Barnwell stopped me in my rn.ldc.reer
and saved me from an ignominious death,—Tarn, & c
" A CONVERT."
A celebrated Divine observes, that "fathers and heads of families, whose duty it is to watch over the
morals of the rising generation, would do well to permit young people under their direction to be presnt
at the performance of this excelled! Tragedy, in which instruction is blended with amusement."

BEACON
Or, T h e N O R W E G I A N

WRECKERS.

This D R A M A , which for interest and situation, is not surpassed by any Piece on the British Stage,
is founded on an Occurrence which took place on the Coast of Norway, al»out ten years ago. The
Sand Banks and Shoals on that Coast require to be pointed out to the devoted Mariner, and Humanity
prompted a Plan whereby many a Gallant Life might be saved, and Commerce encouraged.—The Norwegian Government stationed, on these Shoals, the Hulks of Vessels of W a r , which were no longer
fit lor service:—these Beacons, which were raanifd by Criminals who were doom'd to banishment for
life, were thus made to benefit society at large, and do penance t o the offended laws of their Country,
each night warned Vessels from the local danger. Three desperate Criminals, not content with having
harassed their fellow-men on land, instead of lighting the Beacon when required, made the deluded
Seamen their prey, in perraiting them to steer on those fatal Shoals, and ferociously sacrificing them.

On FRIDAY

Evening,

October 8th, 182T,

Will be acted Shakspeare's admir'd Tragedy of

OTHELLO.
MO OH of JTEJVICE.

*

The beauties of this play impress themselves so strongly upon the attention of the reader, that they
can draw no aid from critical illustration.—The fiery openness of Othello, magnanimous, artless and
credulous, boundless in his confidence, ardent in his affections, inflexible in his resolution, and obdurate
in his revenge; the cool malignancy of lago. silent in his resentments, subtle in his designs, and at
once studious of his interest and vengeance; the soft simplicity of Desdemona, confident of merit, and
conscious of innocence, her artless perseverence in her suit, and her slowness to suspect that she can
be suspected, are such proofs of Shakspeares' skill in human nature, as we suppose it is in vain to seek
in any modern writer.

The extraordinary Performance of this inimitable Man, in his Personation of the BRAZILIAN APE, is considered
by the Public and the Press of London, to be the finest effort of Dramatic Genius ever attempted; the Dying Scene
of the Tyrant Richard, or the Jealous Moor (of Shakspeare) represented by the late Edmund Kean, or the immortal
fiarriek, never made a deeper inopression on the Public, than the Dying Scene in " JOCKO," a Drama written
expressly for the display of the peculiar abilities of MONSIEUR GOTJFFE.

To enter into a detail of the above Play would be to deprive the Spectator of the pleasure he must necessarily derive from

he Jewess. ThefirstEighteen Nights ofits performance, the enormous sum of J.29,500 was taken at the doors! which ex*eedi?d by some thousands the greatest receipts ever known at any Theatre in the same time.

• The Kettle and tbe Cricket, at one aud the same momeat, aud by some powers of amalgamation, bes known to themselves, sent each his fireside soag of comfort, streaming
>ato a ray of the candle that shone oat through the window, and a long way down the lane."

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE STRANGER.
- If you please I was left to be called for, said the strauger mildly.''
• Doa't mind me.'
With that he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets, and a book
irom the other, and leisurely began to read. The carrier and his wife exchanged a iook of perplexity.

Visit of Caleb and Tackleton. The suspicions ot the Carrier awakened.
' The good car-tier was puzzled and made uncomfortable and uncertain, in spite of himself—lie eould'nt help shewing it in his manner.

THE ALARM.

" S h e only a u w e r e . hf beating her hands together and falling into a wild St of laughter.—Then sinking from his grasp upon the ground, she covered her face with her aproa
and wept bitterly."

" A little tracked nutshell of a house, but no better than a pimple on the prominent red-brick nose of Gruff and Tackieton. The premises of Gruff and Tackleton were

ajanied J . h n , haye we made our little Fic-N'ic here.—If anything was to go wrong with it, 1 should almost think we were never going to he luekly again."

T.H.1 BiauD £3a.V8 OonFM3B3oM,

" WMe sneaking she bad released May Fielding's hands, and clasped her garments in an attitude ot mingled supplication and love.—Sinking tower and lower down, as she proceeded in
her .triage confession, she dropped at last at the teet of her friend, and bid her face in the folds ot her dress."
• Alas' "exclaimed her father, smitten at one blow with the truth, " have 1 deceived her from her cradle, bat to break her Swart at last?"

Last

but Two of the Engagement of that
Extraordinary Actor,

THE AFRICAN

&$• The performances of the above singularly sifted actor, and extraordinary man
have nightly been hailed by crowded and delighted audiences with acclamations of
applause, and at the termination of each representation he has been called before
the Curtain to receive the Congratulations of the PubUc.
The unprecedented novelty of A N A T I V E A F R I C A N pertimating Dramatic Character*, has excited a degree of interest unparalleled in the
Afui..l» of the Drama, and hw enthusiastic reception and success in all the principal Theatres in Great Britain, has induced the Manager, at VERY CONSIDE*
RABLE EXPENSE, to form an Engagement with him for a limited number of Night*—he will make hi* Sth Appearance on Saturday Evening, Augn*t
8th, in the Character* of

GAMBIA, IN THE SLAVE
A* the African Rotcta* i» the only Actor of Colour that wa*ever known, and probably the only instance that may occur, and having b«.n acknowlt^ed by
the Pre** of England, Ireland, and Scotland, to pos*e*s histrionic talent of the highest order, thefollowingsketch of hi* life may not be unacceptable .—
The African's progenitors, down to the Grandfather of t h . subject of this mem.ir..were Prinees of the Feulah tribe, whose dort.im.ns were Senegal, on the
b.nks of the river of that name. The father of the present individual was sent for his education to Schenectady College, near New York, in the United Stales.
Three days after his departure from his native shore, an insurrection broke out among the tribe, arising chiefly from a wish on the part of their King, to exchange
pri- oners taken in battle, instead of adopting the umal barbarous custvm of selling tbemforslaves. His humanity, however, interfered with an established per.
quisitetong possessed by some of his principal officers. The Grandfather of the present African Roscias, through their interested policy, fell a victim to b.«
mutinous subjects. Deprived of the means of asserting his birthright, and to a certain degree cast upon the world as a cosmopolite, the lather became a clergy,
man, and officiates in New York. The subject of this memoir was born July 24tb,1807, and was destinedforthe same profession, but preferring the sock ami
buskin, he departed from hi* father's roof, and wended his way to the shore* of Old Egland.

On Saturday Evening, August 8, 1846
Will be presented the justly popular Musical Play, (in Three Acts) of The

THE CiiKor.E part of the population made themselves remarkable by the intrepidity they displayed on
board the Fleets of France, or by the efforts of individual enterprise; but the European looked with
disdain upon the Creole, who in turn regarded the former as an adventurer.
The Islanders were held in contempt by the poor noblesse of Mauritius, on account of their ignoble
extraction. It was remarked also that towards the latter end of the century, the French inhabitants of
Mauritius appeared neither independent in their circumstances nor easy in their minds, though they affected
dress and gaiety ; the condition of the Slave was that of the lowest and most abject degradation, numbers
of those unfortunates had European blood in their veins, being the offspring of liaisons between the Planters
and their Slaves, but such a pedigree only increased their misfortune.—vide " England's Colonial Empire.'

And should his humour, and ' i< mimic art.

For yon, with diffidence, lie bids me sayShould you approve, you may command his stay.
To lie and aw KggH here another day ;

Lends to your favourite bard hi.s ponderous aid :
No man in buckram he, for stuffing gear,
A feather bed, and pillow bier,
With honest Flesh, and Blood, and Hone,
And weighing, more or lens, some twenty (tone !
IJp.ua the Northern Coast by chance we .aught him.
And hither, in a Broad-wheef Wagon, brought him.
For in a Chaise the varlet ne'er could enter,
And no Mail Coach on such a Fare would venture!

Amy Cassonette,
by a YOLWG LADY O F LEAMINGTON.
The story on winch this Drama is founded, possesses peculiar claims on the sympathy and approbation of the Public.—The Count St Angeville, being left guardian to the young and interesting Amy
Casaonette, involves her fortune by a career of dissipation and extavaganc* ; the hand of his SonVictor is
destined for Amy, but her affections having been giveti to Count Rusenford, St. Angeville, to avoid
public disgrace, resolves on the

MURDER OF T H E INNOCENT AMY;
To effect which, he employs the Savage

of the

Mountain.

But, providentially. Amy and Violelte having exchang. >l bed... hambers, the dagger of the Assassin is
directed to the bosom of St. Angeville's daughter, Violette, instead of the purposed victim. St.
Angeville, overwhelmed by remorse, is on the point of discovering himself to the Magistrate, who is in
pursuit of the Savage, he having effected his exciipe with hi«. supposed lifeless victim, Violette.
Victor, to onve his Father from Public Execution, avows himself the Criminal.

F a t h e r & Son a r e confined in a Chamber of the Castle!
but are it-leased by a faithful servant, Von Franc. The Mountain Savage, beaiing the insensible
Violette, takes refuge amid the Hocks of La Charbonnirre; Count Rosenford seeks ..belter in the
same C a v e . - A TERRIFIC I O M HAT between COUNT ROSEN FORD&THE SA V *GI is followed
by the discoveiy that Violette's life has heeu pmerved ; the Count is cleared of all suspicion, and an
excellent moral is inculcated, that of bending in humble resignation to that power whose protecting
arm is always extended to Hctvard the Innocent and Punish the Guilty.'

M r . M I L D E N H A L L has the honour of announcing to the Nohility, Ladies, Gentlemen, and
Inhabitants generally of L E D B U R Y , and its Vicinity, that he has at.a very considerable expense fitted
up a Theatre, having obtained permission of the proper authority, which he trusts will meet with t h .
approbation of the Patrons of the Drama,
The Boxes are fitted up with Crimson furniture, and the seats stuffed and newly covered, and
every comfort studied to the utmost.
The inside of the Roof is entirely covered in a novel and handsome manner, an arched ceiling
Laving been thrown completely oyer, and tastefully decorated.
The Wardrobe is of the most splendid description, together with the Scenery and Decoration*, which are all new; and in the production of new pieces (which will be of the greatest novelty)
the same attention will be paid as in a London Theatre ; nor will any expense or pains be spared to bring
them forward on a scale of magnificence, and the Company is of high professional celebrity and respectability.
M r . M. begs to state that he has secured valuable and highly esteemed talents in the person of
M r . D Y E R , from the Theatres-Royal Plymouth, Worcester, &c„ who is also Stage Manager to t h .

On Wednesday Evening, Sep. 2nd, 1820,
Will be performed Sheridan'* admirable Play of

Pistarro :
Or, The Spaniards in Peru.

Piy.arro, on its Imt appearance, was denominated a Grand National Play ; and certainly no other piece
ever combined sentiments of loyally, liberty, and patriotism, so peculiarly adapted to the feelings of the English peovjdo. No play in the annals of Dramatic History ever boasted so brilliant a career, met with such
universal suffrage, or ever drew to the Metropolitan and Provincial Theatres throughout the empire such
overflowing houses. The classic Sheridan transfused iuto this admired production, originally from the pen
of the unfortunate Kotsebue, his own inimitable elegance of genius. The name of Sheridan will immortalize the British literary character wherever our language is spoken or understood; end which, like that of
Shakspeare, has raised our reputation in the scale of dramatic taste and elegance, above that of every rival
nation,

The whole to conclude with the highly admired and intensely interesting Drama (as BOW performing in
London) of—THE

PHANTOM

Or, The Somnambulist.
" We question," say the London Critics, " i f dumb show ever excited more intense feelings than those
which oeeasionally thrili the audience in th6 representation of this delightful pieee."

The scone of the piece ia laid in a village in France, where the fears of the villagers were in a state
of perpetual excitement by the appearance of a supposed Phantom. I t opens with the preparations for
the nuptials of Edmund and Ernestine; duringwhich Colonel Rosambert arrives, and determines to rest
for the night in the haunted Pavilion : he is alarmed by the entrance of the Phantom into his chamber,
whom he discovers to be Ernestine walking in her sleep. The interest of the piece now becomes intense.
Edmund, with Villagers, comes in the morning and discovers Ernestine on Rosambert's couch, he arouses
her, upbraids her with infidelity, and indignantly declares his resolution not to wed her, and in hysterical
fits she is carried into the mill and falls to sleep. Edmund determines immediately to marry Gertrude,
but just as they arc all assembled, Ernestine is seen in the most awfully perilous situation, walking in her
sleep along the top of the house; she gets to the extremity, and appears in danger of being dashed to
pieces, she is then seen in the most frightful manner to cross the Plank over the large Water Mill, which
is rapidly turning in the stream, and threatens to crush her to atoms should she make a false s t e p ; the
plank is heard to crash, causing the spectators to make an iuvoluntary exclamation of terror at the horribly fearful situation of Ernestine.
The attention of the audience now becomes rivetted to breathless
expectation; Ernestine descends by a high mined wall, which falls away beneath her feet, and exposes
her to the most imminent danger. f»he at length reaches the ground in safety, speaks in her sleep of the
desertion of Edmund, who now convinced of her innocence, places the ring on h e r finger and arouses
her : an explanation takes place, and Ernestine, with an hysterical cry of joy, rushes into the arms of
Edmund.

Ros€?itfs,

On Wednesday Ereniny,

February 2 , 1831,

Will be -.rfornM.4 Sheridan'* admirable Play of

OR, T H E S P A N I A R D S I N P E R U .
Pifcawo, on its first appearance, was denominated a Grand National Play; and certainly no
other piece e-er combined se-jtiments of loyalty, liberty, and partiotism, so peculiarly adapted
to the feeling, of the English people. No play in the annals of Dramatic History ever boasted
*0 brilliant a career, met with such universal suffrage, or ever drew to the Metropolitan, and
Provincial Theatre., throughout the Empire, such overflowing houses. The classic Sheridan
transfused into this admirable production (originally from the pen of the unfortunate Kotzebue,)
his own inimitable elegance of genius. The name of Sheridan will immortalize the British literary character, wherever our language is spoken or understood ; and which, like that of Shakspeare, has raised our reputation in the scale of Dramatic taste and elegance, above thsdr of every
nation.

.first Might of an eriginal historical & £egendarn ffirama,
ENTITLED-

Catherine

Dudley ;

Or, The RECLUSE of LEDBURY.
MR. SANDERS,
In announcing the above original Drama, begs leave to state that, actuated by the strongest desire to
merit public favour, he has been induced to employ a writer for the stage to connect, in a dramatic
fonn, the various legendary notices, so current in the county of Hereford, respecting that celebrated
tecluse, CATHERINE AUDI.* Y. The deep interest which Catherine's solitary mode of life had inspired
-<he romantic circumstances which influenced her to select the beautiful environs of Ledbury for her
abode—the undeviating piety in which her latter days were passed— and the singular and steadfast
attachment of her companion MABKIT— seem peculiarly adapted to inculcate, through the medium of
Theatrical representation, those most important virtues—patience, self-control, and unostentatious
ity. The circumstances of the times in which Catherine Audley lived are likewise admirably
fitted for Dramatic illustration :—The contentions of the proud Barons with their unfortunate sovereign
K<!ward II.—his imprisonment in Berkley Castle—the desertion of all his friends, even the Queen
lla his wife—the ignorance in which his son, the renowned Edward III., was kept concernis father's fate—and the awfril and appalling catastrophe of the King's assassination by Berkley,
• may, and Montravers—present, to the selection of the Dramatist, an accumulation of incident
of a most varied and powerfully-interesting character; and which, no doubt, would exert a natural
influence on a mind so originally constituted as that of Catherine Audley. It would only be anticipating the Drama to enter into any details of the singular vicissitudes which led the pious Catherine
to seek an asylum in the neighbourhood of Ledbury; but they all prove of that romantic desoripbest suited for Scenic display, and which terminate in the full accomplishment of an ancient
hecy, which is bore transcribed with only those literal alterations which the change in the
orthography of our language renders necessary for its being generally understood:—
<• The lust of the daughters of Audley', oH line
A !>U(rrim shall wander from shrine unto shrine ;
Without rest, without refuge, the Maiden shall go.
Till she comes where the waters of J,etltlon's stream flow ;
When the bells of a grey and an ivy'd church-tow'r
Without hands shall be peal'd to point out her lone bow'r ;
Wliere the Virgin Recluse, by long sorrows opprest,
Shall gain from the world her rude mansion of rest."

'that the illusion of the Drama may in no part be incomplete. Ma. SANDERS has the honour
•mounce that the Scenery will in part consist of

Gentleman.
S I R W A L T E H SCOTT thus speaks of this excellent Play :—" The Poor Gentleman is a
Comedy of (the most sterling value, and should be placed in front of the dramatic line.
It is.one of those regular dramatic amusements of our country that throws the flimsy,
phemeral productions of the present day far in the r e a r : it is calculated to open the
heart of an Englishman to every thing that is high, noble, and generous: to show him
the beauty of virtue and the hidc-ousness of vice ; to make him firmly attached to liberty
and loyalty ; to impress his mind with affection for his family, love for his country, and
-bedience to his King."—Vide Sir Walter Seott't Letter to G. Colman, Etq.

The whole to conclude with the much-admired Piece, in 3 Acts, called—THE

WANDERING
OR, THE

CASTLE O F OLIVAL.
The hamlet of Olival, in Providence, is the scene of this very interesting Piece. A
Hustic Festival is observed, in which the whole village partakes. T h e bounties annexed
io this Fete are proclaimed on the anniversary: The humane intention declares, " If,
on the day of the Feast, any Orphan or two Orphans, but no more, and not exceeding
the age of sixteen, should arrive as strangers in Olival, they shall, if found worthy of
the bounty, be adopted in the village and provided for." Two Orphans present themselves by mere accident: their peculiar manner and deportment, togetner with their
mysterious account of themselves, excite an immediate and minuto inquiry. Their history unfolds acts of the basest perfidy and cruelty :—sacred justice interposes—suffering
innocence is atoned—remorseless villany meets its doom—and the murderer's means
recoil upon himself.

Who take the liberty most respectfully of soliciting of the Nobility, Gentry, and Inhabitant* generally of Ledbury and its Vicinity, a share of that patronage and support which
I is, and ever will be, their study to deserve.

On Monday Evening, J a n . 3 0 t h , 1 8 3 1 ,
,,V.H l,c performed, HOWARD PAYNL'a celebrated TRAGEDY of

BRUTUS;
Or, The ROMAN F A T H E R .

W

No fewer than seven Plays contend for the honour of having introduced this interesting subject on the Stage. Mr
HowARB PAYNE has made very judicious use of the ample materials that were placed before him: be has strung the
iiearls, and successfully fashioned them to the public taste; he ha* followed History when the was likely to prove intcrestoiij-i and varied her without destroying hir beauty or integrity. The character of BRUTUS in this Tragedy is drawn
witn great power i his assumed idiotcy, in the early scenes, is an admirable cloak to his future designs, ana contrasts well
>v ill the pathos and energy that burst forth as his character is further developed , but. when actuated by patriotism and
(lie sacred love of justice, he condemns his son to death for having conspired against the state. His a olimax of theatrical
. presentation which few authors in such a masterly style have brought before the Public.

Beg leave most respectfully to acquaint the Ladies, Gentlemen, and Inhabitants of
Ledbury and its Vi.inity, that their B E N E F I T is fixed to take place on MONDAY
Evening, Feb. 6; on which occasion they solicit that share of patronage which it has
been their constant study to merit, and ambition to obtain.
" 'Tis not in mortals to command success ;
*' We may do more—endeavour to deserve it."

On Monday Evening, F e b . 6 t h , 1 8 3 1 ,
Will be performed, Moore's admired Trapedy of—THE

Gamester

The GAMESTER is, in the truest sense of the,word, a Domestic Tragedy. It exhibits a just and pathetic picture of the infatuation and effects of Gamin,-; and not an
incident is introduced that is not warranted by fatal experience. The language, though
written in prose, has all the spirit of poetry ; and the mind that is not awakened and
improved by an exhibition of such deep interest and importance must be dead to reason,
sensibility, and virtue.
