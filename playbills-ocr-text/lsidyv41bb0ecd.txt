On a commanding eminence, in the centre of the Harlz Mountains, stand a cluster of ivy-bound ruins, in contemplating which, much of their >ncient grandeur is left to the imagination Yet tradition has clothed them with fearful conjecture, and embellished them with supernatural illusion, and forms on winter nights the ground-work of many a fearful legend, with which the sire of each hamlet, or mountain guide, entertains the passing traveller. The most noted Lord of the once proud domain was surnamed “ The Gold Mine King.” He wm Ulobly born, but having lost his parents early, and squandered his fortune, ’twos then, “ Hurrah for the road,” with him, by which means he speedily became the most powerful and wealthy marauder of the age. His followers were so numerous, well armed, and hardy, that none of the neighbouring slates cared unnecessarily to meddle with him.
To get ‘rid of this Prince of miwhief and ill,	I	They swore by Lncifer none could match him,
The state and the lawyers had their fill}	|	In fact, he was fly they could not catch him.
dut contented themselves with acting to the best of their ability on the defensive, and 'tis even said the state allowed this mountain monarch, a secret ipend, upon condition that they should be exempted from his depredations.— From the Chronicles of “ Fra Giacomo,” in the Archive»

(Of the Theatres Royal Drury Lane and Covent Carden,)

WHO IS ENGAGED FOR
Positively Five M^hts Only!
Pronounced by the Edinburgh Press to be the Greatest ActTCSS Of the present Day- and who lately attracted crowded audiences in that city unequalled since the days of Miss O’Neill and Mrs. Siddons, and again received last night at this Theatre by a Brilliant and Overflowing Audience with enthusiastic Plaudits from all Parts of the House.
griH.IT OX* THE FU8UO jrOVXUTE.ES.
I iif.,1 ¡'he Royal.—Miss Fanclt appeared every night last week, and on each occasion with distinguished success. Amongst tlie greatest triumphs of her art may be ■aemioaed her performance of Julia, in Knowles’ play of “ The Hunchback,'’ which she has performed twice—the second time on Saturday night. It is indeed a magnificent .’¿splay of feeling and of passion, and it is of itself sufficient to give her place with those spirits of a departed age—the Siddonses and the O'Neils—whose peiforamees hve only .11 the memory of a circle that is daily lessening. Tn the opening of the drama Miss Faucit was gay, artless, and cheerful; but it was in the scenes where distress thickens upon ler that her genius came out in its full strength. Scorn, vexation, and pity were successively portrayed, until at last, when questioning her feelings, she makes the discovery that •he still loves, she burst forth in an energy of passion which awed by its sublimity all who listened to her. Her interview with her former lover, now humbled into the secretary .¿’her affianced husband, overstrained as that scene is in its opening, was truly wonderful; every varying passion in her mind was depicted with a truth to nature which only the lighest genius could command, and when she burst from his embrace, exclaiming, “ My honour, Sir!” the effect upon the house was overpowering. So, in the subsequent atervie« with Mr. Walter, when she charges him to find her out someway of escaping the nuptials to which she had so rashly consented, and painted to him ¿he fearful consequences which might otherwise ensue, her commanding figure, her expressive countenance, her earnest and energetic elocution, her imposing attitude, all seemed to realise Ue idea of a superior being uttering a prophetic warning and the hushed attention and subdued state of feeling on tile part of the audience, helped to increase the illusion.— idinburgh Cowant.
Thkatrb Royal.—Miss H. Faucit s performances are becoming more attractive as her engagement draws to a close; and nightly the enthusiastic plaudits of the audience attest her great and brilliant powers. On Monday evening she appeared as Lady Macbeth, and, though we had our fears on the subject, performed the whole character ith the finest effect. The banquet and sleep-walking scenes, in particular, were most admirable. We have not space, however, for detailed criticism Last night “ The Lady f Lyons ’ was repeated to a crowded house—her Pauline was exquisite, and drew down the most, rapturous bursts of applause, the audience appearing as if they would never tire > i the expression of their admiration. We hope, by and by, to notice her performances at greater length.—Edinburgh Evening Post.

HEATRE ROYAL, NEWCASTLE
lessee, JTTr.	JES MUM.KO, JTo. 0, Grainger Street.
Ht MUNRO anxious to gratify the Patrons of the Drama, has the honour of announcing (for the second time) the most singular Novelty in the Theatrical World,
viz.:—an AFRICAN TRAGEDIAN (a Native of Senegal, Africa), known by the Appellation of the
AFRICAM ROSCIUS,
FOR TWO NIGHTS ONLY!
On his return from Scotland,
The performances of the above singularly-gifted actor and extraordinary man were nightly hailed by crowded and delighted audiences with acclamations of applause, ,ind at the termination of each representation he was called before the curtain to receive the congratulations of the public.
As the African Roscius is the only Actor of Colour that was ever known, and probably the only instance that will occur, and having been acknowledged by the Jress of England, Ireland, Scotland, and America, to possess histrionic talent of the highest order, the following Sketch of his Life may not be unacceptable :—
“ The African's progenitors, down to the Grandfather of the subject of this memoir, were Princes of the Foulah Tribe, whose dominions were Senegal, on the banks of the river of that name. The father of the present individual was Bent for his education to Schenectady College, near New York, in the United States. Three days after his departure from, his native shore, an insurrection broke out amongst the tribe, arising chiefly from a wish on the part of their King, to exchange prisoners taken m battle, instead of adopting the usual barbarous custom of selling them for Slaves. His humanity, however, interfered with an established perquisite long possessed by :«me of his principal officers. The Grandfather of the present African Roscius, through their interested policy, fell a victim to his mutinous subjects. Deprived of the means of asserting his birthright and to a certain degree cast upon the world as a cosmopolite, the father became a clergyman and officiated in New York. The subject of this memoir was bom July 24th, 1807, was designed for the same profession, but, preferring the sock and buskin, he departed from his father’s roof, and wended hi* way to the shores of Old England.”
m MONDAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 23,1846,
Will be acted (compressed iato Three Acts) Maturing Tragedy of
Bertram,
OR, THE CASTLE OF ST. ALDOBRAND.

■ ON	VMMYKVKiMNU, APRIL 3, 1840,
Will be performed a New and Original Drama, written expressly for this Theatre, in 3 Parts or Chirps, founded on the popular Fairy Tale by Mr C. Dickens, THE
CRICKET * THE HEARTH
1 | | 1 III TAltl! OF HO HE.
The New Scenes (incidental to the Piece) “ THE CARRIER'S KITCHEN,” “ THE VISION,” and “ THE TOY SHOP,” Painted expressly for the occasion, by Mr FULLER, The Machinery and Appointments by Mi NICHOLSON. The Piece produced under the direction of Mr J. W. BENSON.
(fif* The story is not “ a mingled yarn," but a genuine homely thread of great simplicity—The Character» more in humble life—The Incident a mistake, which for a time ruffles the peace of a homely-contented circle, is eventually cleared up to the satisfaction of all—The strong“ Domestic Feeling” which has been regarded as the best feature of ** English Worth” constitutes the great mastery of the Tale—Scenes of paternal affection and touching beauty, not merely «• lumbering, »low, and honest,” but “ light of spirit,”—rich in the true an 1 genuine poetry of the heart, judiciously relieve the “ working-day”—Character of the principal Actors—And invest this most poetic creation with the old familiar phases of every-day life, the most ° prominent of which will be instantly recognised in the “ English” Mother and the “ English Home.”
John Peerybingle, the Carrier, Mr. ROXBY.
“ That lum keriug, slow, honest John : John so heavy, but so light of spirit; so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the core ; so dull without, so quick within ; so stolid, but so good.”
Tackleton, the Toy Maker, -	-	- Mr VOIJiiCi.
“ He didn’t look much like a Bridegroom as he stood in the carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face and a screw in his body, and his hat jerked over the bridge of his nose, and his han ds stuck down into the bottoms of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic, ill-conditioned self, peering out of one little corner of one little eve. like the concentrated esse ncc of any number of ravens.”
Caleb Plummer, his Man, -	-	- Mir lIUfcrlliES.
“ A little, meagre, thoughtful, dirty-faced man, who seemed to have made himself a great coat from the sack-cloth covering of some old box; for when he turned to shut the door, he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription C and T in large black capitals.”
The Stranger, ...... Mr 1WAVLEV
" His garb was very qnaint and odd_a long, long way behind the time He had
long white hair; good features singularly bold and well defined for an old man ; and dark, bright, penetrating eyes.”
Iffrs Feerybingle, familiarly known as “ Hot,” Mrs WIRE
" Fair she was, and young—though something of what is called the dumpling shape ; but I don’t myself object to that.”
Bertha, Caleb Plummer’s blind Child, Mrs SIMMS.
“ She and her father lived all alone by themselves, as the story books say—and my blessing, with yours to back it, I hope on the story books, for saying any thing in this workaday world ”
May Fielding, .... Miss 8I9KPSOM.
*• Tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question. May was very pretty.”
Mr* Fielding, herMother, -	- Mrs CROFT.
" An old lady with a peevish face, who was very genteel and patronising. The majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap, calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of ave.”
Miss 1 Illy »lowboy, a Foundling, - Mr MARE.
“ The maternal and paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to fame, and Tilly had been bred by public chaiity a Foundling; which word, though differing only from Fondling bj one vowel's length, is very different in meaning, and expresses quite mother thing.”
Spirit of tha Cricket, - Miss H. SIMMS.
“ The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room, and stood in fairy shape before him.”
CHIRP THE FIRST.
John Feerybingle’s Cottage—
WEICOME T® HER UV8BAXD.
The Kettle and the Cricket, at one and the same moment, and by some powers of »malgamaGou best known to themselves, sent each his fireside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the window, and a long way down
thft lam»
lotherand the
The IiitrAdiietlon to ttie Stranger.
If you please I was to be ‘ left ’till called for,’ said the stranger mildly. • Don't mind me.’ With that he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets, and a book from the other, and leisurely began to read. The carrier and his wifeexchanged a look of perplexity.” Visit of Caleb and Tackleton. The suspicions of the carrier awakened. The alarm..
“ She only answered by heating her hands together and falling into a wild fit of laughter. Then sinking from his grasp upon the ground she covered her face with her apron, and wept bitterly.”
The Stranger received into tin» Carrier’s House.
CHIRP THE SECOND-
The Abode of Caleb Plummer, the Toy Maker.
“ A little cracked nutshell of a house, but no better than a pimple on the prominent red-brick nose of Graff and Tackleton. The premises of Gruff and Tacklcton were the great features of the street; but you might have knocked down Caleb’s dwelling with a hammer or two, and carried off the pieaes in a cart.” The Blind Girl hek Father.
* In the midst of all these objects Caleb and his Daughter sat at work—the Blind Girl busy as a doll’s dress-maker; and h painting and glazing the four-pair front of a desirable family mansion "
91r§. PEERYBv	PIC-MIC.
“ I declare I would not go to Bertha s without the veal and ham pie, and things, and bottles of beer, for any money. Regularly once a fortnight, ever since we have been married, John, have we made our little pic-nic here. If any thing was to go wrong with it, I should almost think we were never to be lucky again.”
Tiam	fuetirs cojvwesguoiv.
“ While speaking she had released May Fielding's hands, and clasped her garments in an attitude of mingled supplication and love. Sinking lower and lower down, a* she proceeded in her strange confession, she drooped at last at the feet of her friend, and hid her blind face in the folds of her dress.”
“ ‘ Great God.’ exclaimed her father, smitten at one blow with the truth, ‘ have I deceive I her from the cradle, but to break her heart at last.’ ”
Thi Stranger joins the Party.
“ A chair in the corner, and leave to sit quiet and silent, and look pleasantly about him is all he cares for.” The fearful DUauv iry.
*• The carrier clinched his strong right hand at first, as if he would have beaten down a lion. Bat opening it immediately again, he spread it out before the eyes of Tackleton, for he was tender of her, even then, and felldown as weak as any infant.”
CHIRP THE THIRD-
THE CAlLMBa’S COTTAGE.
“He sat brooding on his hearth, now cold and dark.’’ Thb Cricket on the Heabth—The Funr Visions of Home.
“ For all the cricket tribe are potent spirits, even though the people who hold converse with them do not knmv it (which is frequently the case): and there are not in the unseen worl l, voices more gentle an l more true ; that may be so implicitly relied on, or that are so cerUi i to give none hut tenderaSt counsel, as the voices with whioh the spirits of the fireside and hearth address themselves to human kind." The Carrier’s Determination. “ ¡Staunch Cricket on the Hearth! loyal Household Fairies.”
The Ntrnnger Discovered—The Do.oucmeni.

“ The life of a Soldier is f ree from care,
He laughs at the troubles around him—
If in war, he has plunder enongh to share, And in peace geod quarters are found him."
“ Like a a Lion he’ll brave the foe’s attack, If his money and means are expended,
And if from the battle he never comes back, Why then all his troubles are ended.”
SOLDIERS OX GUARD-DAY BREAK—THE SAXOX WARDER—AXD THE SPY.

my father Ivar, with potent spell and incantation—possessed of that—in spite of adverse fate, we triumph still.”
THE NEATHERD, AN ANCIENT BRITON.

'‘Olroel and remorseless Dane, for extension, not security you came; hardly do we sheathe our swords in peace, ere some new outrage calls us to the Held again-—Think yeu that England will endure this tamely ? never—ire'll drive the insolent invaders from our shores, or die upon the soil that
bred us.”
66 THE SACRED EAYEK
“ Plumes her wings again, craving a bloody banquet.”

COSHEMUBATIVE OF THE
The Text collated from the Folio and Quarto Editions of 1607 and 1623, by Mr DAVIS
mi IMUl u m
Of this Play it has been justly observed that the Imagination is held captive by Scenes of high creative power,exquisite Poetry, and much delicate feeling, enlivened by Humour, the most frolic and grotesque, a brilliant emanation from the rich treasure house of the Poet's fancy. How exquisite the Fairy Ideal, and yet they are human, their hearts warm with Human passions ; Gossip, Flattery, Intrigue, and Quarrel are their delight, and you sigh with, or smile at them, precisely as you do at Theseus and Hyppolita. How admirably does the Poet like the Arc of humanity, bend all his Characters into the one centre of Man • how his Villains, Ghosts, Witches, Fairies, Fools, Heroes, .Clowns, and Kings are all human, disguises, or half lengths, never Caricatures or apologies for mankind. How full the cup of manhood cut of which he could baptize, now an Iago, and now an Agirechepk—now a Bottom, and now a Macbeth—now a Dogberry, and now a Caliban—now an Ariel, and now a Timon, into the one communion of the one family; how exquisitely adjusted are the human to the superhuman Actors, they never jostle, yon never wonder at finding them on the same Stage—they meet without a start, they part without a shudder—they obey one Magic, and you feel that not only does one touch of Nature make the whole World kin, but it can link th» universe in one brotherhood ; for the secret of this adjustment lies entirely in the humanity which is diffused through every part of the Drama; in it, as in one soft ether,float, swim, play, or dive, all the Characters.
“ A» IamgtimUm fcwlir. forts»	Tnrna them to »hat»«, and give« to airy nothing
Xhc form of ihiHga unkiowD, tbc Pmk'm pen	A local habhaiion and a name»**
In short, in the above Play the Poet has given the noblest Illustration of bis own description, and the “Imagination all compact” that could produce a piece of
such high inspiration, may well claim to soar above every other to the END OF TIME!

Krancis Gastrill, the occupant of tho house, from the frequent importunities of Travellers, conceived a dislike to the tree, and in evil houf, in contempt of the popular adoration, ordered the Tree to be felled and its Logs split for firewood ; a general odium was excited, and a watch-maker named Thomas j-p, of that town, secured the pieces, and converted the fragmente to uses widely different from those to which the Tree had been irreligiously condemned.

Juan, not dismayed, invites the Statue to a Banquet, to which it assents. The Ghost enters and seats itself at the Table.

ADDRESS.
THEATRE,
MUSIC HAUL, NEWCASTLE,
July 14 th, 1832.
THE Performers return their sincere Thanks to the Public, fbr the liberal Support they have received; and, ere they take a final leave of their Patrons, beg to offer a few Remarks on a Paragraph which appeared in the Tyne Mercury, of Tuesday last.
The Writer of the Article in question is either totally ignorant of the Circa instances which led to the “ legal Disagreement,” or guilty of wilful Misrepresentation. He asserts that the Performers were the immediate cause of the abrupt termination of the Season, inasmuch as they thought proper to perform at Shields against the express orders of their Manager, thereby rendering themselves subject to the Forfeiture of their whole Week’s Salary, agreeably to the “printed Rules and Regulations of all Theatres.” The reverse is the Fact/ Mr. Pope was aware, Three Weeks before the Benefit at Shields took place, that the Company intended assisting their Brother Performer—/¿e knew and never forbade them so doing—nay more,- his Stage Manager actually lent Mr. Bland the books requisite for the occasion. With respect to the “printed Rules and Regulations of all Theatres,” it is a well known Fact that there are not Six provincial Theatres in the Kingdom provided with them ; and the Rules themselves are as various as variety itself, every Manager making or altering them to suit his own immediate Convenience. In the Theatre-Royal, Newcastle, this Season, there have been neither “ Rules ” nor “ Regulations, ” printed or written ; and if there had been, it is well known, that they must first be signed by the Performers themselves before any Forfeits can be legally exacted. The charge brought against them of compelling the Manager to close the Theatre, is entirely groundless. It was his own Act—to prove which, it is only necessary to observe, that he countermanded the order for the Play -bills for Monday, the 2nd. July, and before the Performers were aware they had incurred his displeasure.
Let the Man who has defiled the Columns of a Journal pi’ofessing liberal Principles answer tlie following Questions—if he cannot, the Public will draw their own conclusions.
Was not Mr. Pope we/I aware of the Performance which was to take place at Shields, and did he ever forbid it ?
Did not Mr. Cooper Sinnett, his Stage Manager, lend the Play-books for the avow7ed Purpose of obliging Mr. Bland ?
Did not Mr. Pope avail himself of the Services of the Company on the Friday after the Performance at Shields?
Did he ever express any Disapprobation of their Conduct until the Saturday following ?
Did he not, previous to the “ legal Disagreement,” on Saturday, the 30th. June, countermand the Order for the Play-bills of Monday, the 2nd. July ?
Did he ever cause any “ Rules or Regulations ” to be exhibited in the Theatre ?
As Mr. Pope appeals to the established Custom of Theatres, had he not a Right (according to his own Showing) to give each Performer Six Week's Notice of Discharge ? And did he not close the Theatre without giving any such Notice, thereby throwing some Forty Individuals out of Employment ?
Was not this “legal Disagreement ” a mere Subterfuge on the Part of Mr. Pope, to evade Payment of the Performer’s Salaries ?
Did not Mr. Pope, previous to the Opening of the Theatre, impose on the Public and the Performers by representing himself to be a Man of Fortune, and has he not subsequently proved himself to be a Man of Straw—n mere Adventurer ?

On WEDNESDAY EVENING, September 8th, 1819,

George Barnwell.
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency t>f which has been so very beneficial to tile rising Generation, was founded on mmffs The unfortunate hero of the Piece teas executed for the Murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, in the Reign of Queen ElizabWk, to which he, was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned woman. Step by step she led the unwary Youth to the last cruel Deed, which ter-minuted a most miserable Existence, by the most ignominious Death,
A Story isrecorded, that a young Gentleman of the City of London, having embezzled Part of hit Master's Property, was providentially at a Representation of GEORGE BARNlrELL, at Drury-Lane, when that admirable Actor Mr. Ross, personated the Character of George Barnwell, at whose Pate he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate Contrition and Reformation, The Gentleman so benefited by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to acknowledge his Obligations to the Play and the Performer, for at every subsequent yearly benefit Mr. Ross received One Hundred Pounds Sterling, with a Card to the following Effect.
“ Dear Sir,■*- One Who is indebted to your admirable Representation of George Barnwell for more than Life, for his redeemed Honor and Credit, begs your acceptance of the Inclosed, which Sum yon will receive so long as you continue in the line of your Profession. Happy am I to acknowledge, that the Stage has prevented me from Ruin and Disgrace. George Barnwell stopped me in my Career, and saved me
from an ignominious Death.

On WEDNESDAY EVENING, September 22nd, 1819,
Will be brought forward the New and- Popular TRAGEDY of
BRUTUS;
Or, The Fall of Tarquín.
This Tragedy is founded on one of the most striking event* in Roman History. The Father and the elder Brother of Lucius Junius, were murdered and their wealth seized on by Tarquin,"King of Rome. Lucius Junius, to save himself from the same fate, feigns to he an Idiot; he is therefore suffer«! to live as the fool of the Court, and becomes the sport and derision of the King, his Sons, and the whole People. The melancholy death of his kins'woman Lucretia, occasioned by the brutal violen/*: of Sextus Tarquin, the King’s eldest son, induces him to throw off the mask he so long had worn, and aided by the Sybil Prophecy, “A FOOL SHOULD SET ROME FREE,” rouses the People to break their chain* of Slavery, and expel the Tarquins ; which laid the foundation of Roman greatness, and eventually made them MASTERS OF THE WORLD.	7
The number of Nights this Tragedy has already been acted since its first representation, decidedly proves its rkal merit—Indeed such are its attractive powers, that Drury-Lane Theatre every time it is performed is crowded by ade'lightod and applauding Audience..

SKETCH OF THE STORY.	'
Timour the Tartar, a man of obscure origin, raises Uimself by military fortune,and the most atroefbus crimes, to the Sovereignty of a principal part of Tartary ; not content with this, his ambition prompts him to the usurpation of all the neighbouring States. He has already succeeded in deposing and murdering the Sovereign of Mingrelia, whose Son (Prince Agib) he holds in bond go when the Piece commences. El ited with victory, and alive only to the feeling» of a tyranny that would extend his ambitious views, he makes overtures of marriage to the Princess of Georgia Zorilda, the widowed sovereign of Mingrelia, has awakened tl> ' neighbouring Prince3 to a feeling of compassion, and a sense of their own danger: they are ready 1» rise in arms against the Tyrant. but fearing that their hostility will be the immediate signal for the murder of the Captive Prince, Zorilda, aided by the Georgian Court, forms a stratagem to deceive the tyrant, and to rescue her Son and the incidents which follow are conducted with one of the most pleasin'* and grand Mt-lo-Dramas that has been introduced on the English Stage.	.
