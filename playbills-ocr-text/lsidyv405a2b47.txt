T H E two latest Shakespearean revivals a t this theatre, namely, The ff inter's Tule and Afidsmnmei
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating t h e manners, costumes, a n d architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in t h e cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting t h e far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return to t h e homestead of history, and
offer to t h e public one of those exciting dramas drawn from e u r own annals, in which o u r national
poet has depicted t h e fierce a n d turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
the deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakesp e a r e ; yet h e still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled,"' equally unapproachable a n d imperishable. His historical plays present r e t r o s p e c t i v e t r u t h , encircled by a halo of poetic genius ;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in t h e tragedy o f King liiclund the Second. T h e action extends .ver little more t h a n t h e two
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting a s they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
t h e ruin of another, Ate gorgeous pageantry HI royal state contrasted with the dungeon and t n e ' a s sassin's stroke. Although t h e infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with'unsparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
that the h e a r t responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with sympall v for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning t h e ill-deserving monarch. T o show the importance of the period t o the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that t h e same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of •* murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured t h e political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetrv, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the >ame atmosphere that was impregnated with t h e perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury T a l e s , " not long before the
throne of England was yielded id the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
J o h n Wiekliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst t h e angry roar
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of meditaval
history. T h e Lists at Covtutiy t h e Fleet at Milford H a v e n — t h e Castles of Pembroke and Flint--t h e Garden, where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his " u n p l e a s i n g news"-—the Great
H a l l at Westminster, rebuilt by* Ilk-hard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as the
place where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own-hards to give away his c r o w n " — t h e
Royal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " in grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play.
T h e few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of t h e mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the ( Intmictes which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
event;
and a r e added with t h e view of uviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and titty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which t h e creations of the painter's a r t a r e endowed with animated reality.
A n increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, h a s for some
time been conspicuous in the English public ; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representor
tions conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to s u n o u u d t h e glowing imagery of t h e great Poet
with accompaniments true to t h e time of which he writes---re«/taiwg the scenes and actions which he
describes --exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies t h e conviction t h a t 1 am acting in accordance with t h e 'general
feeling. W h e n plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that t h e
course I have adopted is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout t h e piece, including the overture and entr' actes, has been composed and
adapted by M r . J . L- H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of the period. T h e tune which
accompanies the D a n c e of Itinerant Fools, introduced in t h e Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W . Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " P o p u l a r Music of t h e Olden
Time."
Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in the Dresses appropriated to
t h e Fools. T h e Morris D a n c e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from the Fool's Dance ; and thence a r e traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet R i c h a r d , " introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' actes
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be t h e production of some contemporary bard, ami
served to keep alive t h e feeling of regret for K i n g Richard's fate.
T h e Privy Council Chamber, t h e restoration of the Welsh Castles, the Traitor's G a t e at the Tower
and St George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve and assistants) under t h e
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry Shaw, Esq., F . S A . , I am indebted for much
zealous "assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending t h e preparations for
t h e combat a t Coventry, the bed room of t h e dying J o h n of G a u n t , and many of t h e accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e G a r d e n at Langley, the interior of the D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster H a l l , and the Dungeon at Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
G. Schart, Esq , jun., F.S.A., for many valuable suggestions.
The French metrical history of the deposition of K i n g Richard t h e Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in its illuminated pages ; and the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
In addition to these authorities, several mannscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By t h e preceding statement 1 guarantee the truthfulness and fidelity of t h e entire picture; while
I aiso gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
for their antiquarian knowledge, a n d whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to t h e plan of illustration I h a v e b j t h c i t o a d o p t e d .

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H R two latest Shakespearean revivals at this theatre, namely, The Winters Tale and Midsummer
Ntght's Dream, afforded opportunities or illustrating the manners, costumes, and architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting tha far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return to the homestead of history, and
offer to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from *uir own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the fierce and turbulent passions of* our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
the deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centurier, Ulid a half divide us from Shakespeare ; yet he still lives to the world with "bis fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable; His historical plays present restrosiiective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic genius ;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
than in the tragedy of King Richard the Second. The action extends aver little more than the two
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the atrength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the, assassin's stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with unsparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes bis sorrow in words so sweetly touching*
that the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with sympatlv for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. To show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of '-murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, wlwse light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury Tales," not long before the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Plant agent ts.
John Wickliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending passions; and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one hundred and fifty years, was destined" to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. The Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembr.ke and F l i n t she Garden, where "Old Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing news"—the Great
Hall at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as the
place where unkinged Richard" was constrained " with his own hands to give away his crown"—the
Royal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
King, " in grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in the speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play.
The few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in L.ndoa
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. The entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to sun ound the glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which Jie writes-—realizing the scenes and actions which he
describes—-exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies the conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with the general
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that the
course 1 have adopted is supported by.the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
.
.
.
The Music throughout the piece, including the overture and entr actes, has been composed and
adapted by M r ^ J . L Hatton, in accordance with the character of the period. The tune which
accompanies the Dance of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing the

illuminated in the reign of Edwitrd the Third, the Dancers being equipped in thcDresses appropriated to
the Fools. The Morris Dance, which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from the Fool's Dance ; and thence are traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. The
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' aeles
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
served to keep alive the feeling of regret for King Milliard's fate.
The Privy Council Chamber, the restoration of the Welsh Castles, the Traitor's Gate at the Tower
and St. George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted ("by Mr. Grieve and assistants) under the
atit-erity of Anthony Salvin, Escj., F.S.A. To Henry Shaw, Esq., F.SA., I am indebted for much
zealous assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending the preparations for
the combat at Coventry, the bed room of the dying John of Gaunt, and many of the accessories
introduced into other scenes. The Garden at Langley, the interior of the Duke of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster Hall, and the Dungeon at Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq,, F.S.A.; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. 1 am also indebted to
G. Scbarf, Esq., jun., F.S.A:, for many valuable suggestions.
The French metrical history of the deposition of Ring Richard the Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the i.mod
in its illuminated pages ; and the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking. .
In addition to these authorities, several manuscripts ami books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement I guarantee the truthfulness and fidelity of the entire picture; while
1 also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
tor their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to the plan of illustration 1 have hitherto adopted.

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H E two latest Shakespearean revivals a t this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale a n d Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating t h e m a n n e r s , costumes, a n d architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in t h e cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting t h e far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return to t h e homestead of history, and
offer t o the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from »ur own annals, in which o u r national
poet h a s depicted t h e fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
t h e deepest interest t o every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakespeare ; yet h e still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable a n d imperishable. His historical plays present restrospective t r u t h , encircled by a halo of poetic genius ;
and nowhere has be more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in the tragedy of King Richard the Second. T h e action extends . v e f little more t h a n t h e t w o
closing years of t h a t unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible

•paring fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
that t h e heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with s y m p a t l y for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning t h e ill-deserving monarch. T o show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked t h a t the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of «• murders, treasons, and detested s i n s , " preserves t h e memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured t h e political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with t h e perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury T a l e s , " not long before t h e
throne of England was yielded t o the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
J o h n Wickliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst t h e angry roar
of contending passions: and in t h e hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country,
In t h e present stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of inediaival
history. T h e Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Millord H a v e n — t h e Castles of Pembroke and F l i n t —
the G a r d e n , where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his " u n p l e a s i n g n e w s " — t h e G r e a *
Hall a t Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in bw pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as i '
place where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own hands t o give away his c r o w n " — t .
Royal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conform i
with contemporaneous authorities. Between t h e third and fourth acts 1 have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal entry into London of the " m o u n t i n g " Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " i n grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play.
T h e few sentences intervening amidst t h e clamorous acclamations of t h e mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
event;
and a r e added with t h e view of reviving, a s far a s possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered a s a n historical
picture, in which t h e creations of the painter's a r t are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste t o r recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, h a s for some
time been conspicuous in t h e English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to t h e diffusion of knowledge—to surround t h e glowing imagery of t h e g r e a t Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which h e writes—realizing t h e scenes and actions which he
describes—exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies t h e conviction that 1 a m acting in accordance with t h e general
feeling
W h e n plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that t h e
course 1 have adopted is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout t h e piece, including the overture a n d enlr actes, has been composed and
adtptcd by M r J . L- H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character, of t h e period. T h e tune which
accompanies (he D a n c e of Itinerant Fools, introduced in t h e Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Ldward t h e Second, a n d
is now published in a work by W . Chuppell, B w . , F.S.A., entitled " Popular Music of t h e Olden
Time "
Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's Dance is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in theDresses appropriated to
the Fools T h e Morris D a n c e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed t o have been derived
from t h e Fool's D a n c e ; and thence are traced t h e bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " S w e e t Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the eniV actes
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
served to keep alive the feeling of regret for K i n g Richard's fate
T h e Privy Council Chamber, t h e restoration of the Welsh Castles, the T r a i t o r s G a t e at the Tower
and S t George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve and assistants) under t h e
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry Shaw, Esq., F . S A . , 1 am indebted for much
zealous assistance, besides supplying t h e necessary drawings, and supennteiid.ng t h e preparations for
t h e combat a t Coventry, t h e bed room of the dying J o h n of G a u n t and many of t h e accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e Garden at Langley, the interior of the D u k e of L a n c a s t e r s Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster H a l l , and the Dungeon a t Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . , while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard B u r k e ,
Ulster have afforded me the information requisite for t h e heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
G. scharf, Esq , j u n „ F . S . A . , for many valuable suggestions.
T h e French metrical history of t h e deposition of K i n g Richard t h e Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in its illuminated pages ; and t h e knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton S n u t b , in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
. „ . . . . , , _
I n addition t o these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with t h e works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
Bv t h e preceding statement I guarantee t h e truthfulness and fidelity of the entire p i c t u r e ; while
1 also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that h a s been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
for their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to t h e plan of . l i g a t i o n I have W t h e r t o s d o p t e d .

After which, ( R S t h , 9 9 t h , 4 O t h , 4 1 S t , A 4 9 n d T i m e s ) SHAKESPEARE'. Tragedy of

T H - two latest Shakespearean revivals i t this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating t h e manners, costumes, and architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quilting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now leturn to the homestead of history, and
©tier to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from -.or own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted t h e fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised event, of
the deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from .Shakesp e a r e ; yet he still lives to the world with " b i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable a n d i m perishable. His historical plays present restrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic g e n i u s ;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in the tragedy of King Michittd the Second. T h e action extends aver little more than the t w o
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and t h e assassin's stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with u n sparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
that the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with sympatl y for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. T o show the importance of the period t o the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of '• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
t w o illustrious men, whose light was uodimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
a n d whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known us the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury T a l e s , " not long before the
throne of England was yielded t o the younger branch of the P l a n t a g e n t t s .
J o h n Wickliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
• f contending passions: and in t h e h e a r t s of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
I n the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. T h e Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Millord Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and F l i n t —
t h e G a r d e n , where " O l d A d a m ' s likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing n e w s " — t h e Great
H a l l at Westminster, rebuilt by R i c h a r d , in bis pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as t h e
lace where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own h a r d s to give away his c r o w n " — t h e
.oyal Chambers and the Royal P r i s o n — a r e all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal entry into L o n d o n of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " in grief and p a t i e n c e ; " thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in the speech of York t o his D u c h e s s , towards the close of the play.
T h e few sentences intervening amidst t h e clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in t h e E n g l i s h public; and surely, an attempt to render'dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge-—to surround t h e glowing imagery of t h e great Poet
with accompaniments true t o the time of which h e writes---m*fi.»«..£ the scenes and actions which h e
describes---exhibiting men a s they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
unius. Repeated success justifies t h e conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with the general
eeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, a r e t n a b l e d , by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, 1 cannot be wrong in presuming tbat t h e
course 1 have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in ihe suffrages
• t an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture and entr actes, has been composed a n d
adapted by M r . J . L . H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e c h a r a c t e r of t h e period. The tune which
accompanies the D a n c e of Itinerant Fools, introduced in t h e Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is n.wr published in a work by W . Chappell, Ksq., F.S.A., entitled " P o p u l a r Music of t h e Olden
Tisse."
S t r u t t r e m a r k s that a vestige ol the Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written a n d
•Humiliated in the, reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in theDresses appropriated to
t h e Fools. The. Morris D a n c e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from the Fool's D a n c e ; and thence are traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' aetes
preceding the t h i r d act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
served to keep alive the feeling of regret tor K i n g Richard's fate.
T h e Privy Council Chamber, the restoration of the Welsh Castles, the Traitor's Gate at the Tower
and St. G e o r g e ' s Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve and assistants) under t h e
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry S h a w , Esq., F . S A . , I am indebted for much
zealous assistauce, besides supplying the necessary drawings, unci superintending t h e preparations for
t h e combat a t Coventry, the bed room of t h e dying J o h n of G a u n t , and many of t h e accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e Garden at Laagley, the interior of the D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster H a l l , and the D u n g e o n at Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F . S . A . , and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for t h e heraldic adornments. I am also indebted t o
G . frchart, Esq., jun., F.S.A., for many valuable suggestions.
T h e French metrical history of the deposition of K i n g Richard t h e Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in i t s ' illuminated pages ; and the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, bas been freely imparted in aid of my present u n d e r t a k i n g .
In addition to these authorities, several manuscripts a n d books in t h e British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw h a v e been consulted.
By t h e preceding statement I guarantee t h e truthfulness and fidelity of the entire picture; while
1 also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
tor their antiquarian knowledge, a n d whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to the plan of illustration I h a v e h i t h e r t o adopted.

^-^^

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H B two latest Shakespearean revivals at this theatre, namely, The fVinter't Tale and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating the manners, costumes, and architecture at
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return to the homestead of history, and
offer to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from eur own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of*
the deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakespeare ; yet he still lives to the world with "his fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. His historical plays present restrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic genius;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
than in the tragedy of King Richard the Second. The action extends .ver little more than the two
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the" assassin's stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with unsparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
that the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with sympatl.y for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. To show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of '• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with tbe advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere tbat was impregnated with tbe perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable '• Canterbury Tales," not long before the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
John Wickliffe, M the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. The Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—
the Garden, where "Old Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing news"- -the Great
Hall at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as the
place where unkinged Richard was constrained •• with his own hands to give away his crown"—the
Royal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
King, " in grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in the speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play.
The few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstance* of that remarkable event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. The entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to surround the glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which he writes—realizing the scenes and actions which he
describes-.-exhibiting men as they once lived-—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies the conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with the 'general
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that the
course 1 have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
The Music throughout the piece, including the overture and entr' actes, has been composed and
adapted by Mr. J . L- Hatton, in accordance with the character of the period. The tune which
accompanies the Dance of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the ourpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W. Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " Popular Music of the Olden
Time." Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's Dance is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in theDresses appropriated to
the Fools. The Morris Dance, which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from the Fool's Dance ; and thence are traced tbe bells which characterised the Morris dancers. The
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' actes
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
served to keep alive the feeling of regret tor King Richard's fate.
The Privy Council Chamber, the restoration o f the Welsh Castles, the Traitor's Gate at the Tower
and St. George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by Mr. Grieve and assistants) under the
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. To Henry Shaw, Esq., F.SA., I am indebted for much
zealous "assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending tbe preparations for
the combat at Coventry, the bed room of the dying John of Gaunt, and many of the accessories
introduced into other scenes. The Garden at I.angley, the interior of the Duke of Lancaster's Pahtce,
the streets of Old London, Westminster Hall, and the Dungeon at Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F.S.A.; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
G. Scharf, Esq , jun., F.S.A:, for many valuable suggestions.
The French metrical history of the deposition of King Richard the Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in its illuminated pages; and the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in tM«
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
In addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement I gnarantee the truthfulness and fidelity of the entire picture; while
1 also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
for their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to the plan of illustration I have hitherto adopted.

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H E two latest Shakespearean revivals a t this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale a n d Midsummer
Nigh/'s Dream, afforded opportunities ot illustrating t h e manners, costumes, and architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in t h e cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now i el urn to t h e homestead of historv, and
offer t o the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from - u r own annals, in which o u r national
poet has depicted t h e fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
t h e deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from J-bakesp e a r e ; yet he still lives to t h e world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. His historical plays present restrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic genius \
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in the tragedy of King Richmd the Second. T h e action extends aver little more than t h e two
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting a s they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
t h e ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and t h e a s sassin s stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with u n sparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
t h a t the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with svmpatl y for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning t h e ill-deserving monarch. T o show t h e importance of t h e period t o the progress of civilization, it may be remarked t h a t t h e same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of '• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves t h e memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured t h e political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with t h e perjury a n d faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable ' ' C a n t e r b u r y T a l e s , " n o t long before t h e
throne of England was yielded to t h e younger branch of the Piantagenets.
J o h n Wickliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst t h e angry roar
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth ot one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a t r u e portraiture of mediwv.il
history. T h e Lists a t Coventry—the Fleet a t Milford H a v e n — t h e Castles o f Pembroke and Flint-—
t h e G a r d e n , where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his " impleading n e w s " — t h e G r e a t
H a l l a t Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected a s t h e
lace where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own hands t o give away his c r o w n " — t h e
Loyal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between t h e third and fourth acts I have ventured t o introduce
t h e triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by t h e deposed a n d captive
K i n g , " i n grief anil p a t i e n c e ; " thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech ot York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
T h e few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of t h e mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
ejient;
and a r e added with t h e view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered a s a n historical
picture, in which t h e creations of the painter's a r t a r e endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, h a s for some
time been conspicuous in the English public ; a n d surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge-—to surround t h e glowing imagery of t h e great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which h e writes—realizing t h e scenes and actions which h e
describes—-exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from t h e enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies t h e conviction t h a t 1 a m acting in accordance with t h e general
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, a r e enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be w r o n g in presuming tbat t h e
course 1 have adopted is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture a n d entr' actes, h a s been composed a n d
adapted by M r . J . L- H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of t h e period. T h e tune which
accompanies the D a n c e ot Itinerant Fools, introduced in t h e Episode for t h e purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as t h e reign of E d w a r d t h e Second, and
is now published in a work by W . Chappell, E s q . , F.S.A ., entitled " Popular Music of t h e Olden
Time."
Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the D a n c e r s being equipped in t h e D r e s s e s appropriated to
t h e Fools. T h e Morris D a n c e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed t o have been derived
from t h e Fool's D a n c e ; and thence a r e traced t h e bells which characterised t h e Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' actes
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, a n l
served t o keep alive the feeling of regret tor K i n g Richard's fate.
T h e Privy Council Chamber, the restoration o f t h e W e l s h Castles, the Traitor's G a t e a t t h e Tower
and St George's Hall a t Windsor, have been painted ("by M r . Grieve a n d assistants) under the
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o H e n r y S h a w , Esq., F . S A . , I am indebted for much
zealous assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending t h e preparations for
t h e combat a t Coventry, the bed room of the dying J o h n of G a u n t , a n d many of t h e accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e G a r d e n at Langley, the interior of t h e D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
t h e streets of Old London, Westminster H a l l , a n a the D u n g e o n a t Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
G e o r g e Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while T h o m a s Willement, E s q . , F.S.A., a n d Sir B e r n a r d Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me t h e information requisite for t h e heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
G. Scharf, Esq , jun., F . S . A . , for many valuable suggestions.
T h e French metrical history of t h e deposition of K i n g R i c h a r d the Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of t h e period
in its illuminated p a g e s ; a n d t h e knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
b r a n c h , h a s been freely imparted in aid of my present u n d e r t a k i n g .
I n addition to these authorities, several manuscripts a n d books in t h e British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and S h a w have been consulted.
B y the preceding statement I g u a r a n t e e t h e truthfulness a n d fidelity of t h e entire p i c t u r e ; while
1 also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that b a s been so liberally afforded t o me by men eminent
•or their antiquarian knowledge, a n d whose conviction of t h e usefulness o f my efforts is a gratifying
encourajremeat to adhere to the plan of illustration I have h i t h e r t o adopted.

T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture and entr actes, has been composed a n d
a d a p t e d by M r . J . L- H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of t h e period. The tune which
accompanies the D a n c e ot Itinerant Fools, introduced in t h e Episode for t h e purpose of amusing t h e
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as t h e reign of Edward t h e Secondhand
h b o - r published in a work by W . Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " P o p u l a r Music of t h e Olden
Time "
Strutt remarks that a vestige of the Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written a n d
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in the Dresses appropriated to
t h e Fools. T h e Morris D a n c e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to h a v e been derived
from t h e Fool's D a n c e ; and thence a r e traced the bells which characterised t h e Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr aetes

ANOTHER SHAKESPEK1AN DRAMA,
NOW

K r 4 . P»rk .^>,i»T.j.

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H B two latest Shakespearean revivals a t this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating t h e manners, costumes, a n d architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting t h e far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now l e t u r n to the homestead of history, and
offer to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from *ur own annals, in which o u r national
poet has depicted t h e fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events o t
t h e deepest intersst t o every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakespeare ; yet he still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. H i s historical plays present restrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic g e n i u s ;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in t h e tragedy of King Richard the Second. T h e action extends .ver little more t h a n t h e t w o
closing years of that unhappy monarch's r e i g n - t h o s e brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson exhibiting as they do the •trength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of another, t h e gorgeous pageantry of roval state contrasted with the dungeon and t h e a s sassin s stroke
Although t h e infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with unsparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
t h a t the heart responds to the p o e t s mighty influence, and throbs with sympatl y tor woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying t h e ill-fated, and pardoning t h e ill-deserving monarch. T o show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that t h e same historical page
which is blotted with t h e recital of " murders, treasons, and detested sins,'' preserves t h e memory of
t w o illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured t h e political hori-on,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed t h e same atmosphere that was impregnated with t h e perjury a n d faithlesiness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury I a l e s , not long before the
throne of England was yielded to t h e younger branch of the Plantagei.tts
J o h n Wickliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation, made himselt heard amidst t h e angry roar
of contending passions; and in t h e hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed t h e seed, which, after a,
erowth ot one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
I n the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval'
history
1 he Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Miltord Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—
t h e G a r d e n where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing n e w s " — t h e Great
H a l l at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride ot kingly sway, and afterwards selected a s t h e
place where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own hands to give away his c r o w n " — t h e
Roval Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts 1 have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captwe
K i n g " in griet and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech ot York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
T h e few sentences intervening amidst t h e clamorous acclamations ot t h e mob in this Historical!
Episode are selected from tlie Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
event;
and a r e added with t h e view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as a n historical'
picture in which t h e creations of the painter's a r t a r e endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste tor recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, h a stort o m e
time been conspicuous in t h e English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic r e p r e w n t a tions conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to surround t h e glowing imagery ot the great Poet
with accompaniments true t o the time of which h e writes—realizing the scenes and actions which h e
d e s c r i b e s - exhibiting men a s they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of h i .
eenius
Repeated success justifies t h e conviction that 1 am actiog in accordance with t h e general
Feelintr
W h e n plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no deroeatory "means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that t h e
course I have adopted is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
^ S m S S S ^ S X m A ^ piece, including t h e overture and entr'actes,
has been composed a n d
adaoted by M r J L H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of t h e period. I he tune which

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
TUB two lateit Shakespearean revivals at this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating the manners, costumes, and architecture ot
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return to the homestead of history, and
offer to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from eur own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised-events of
the deepest iatersst to every English miad. Nearly two centuries and a half divide os from ShakesBear, • yet he still lives to the world with *"his fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and in*
M-ishable. His historical plays present restrcpective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic genius ,
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of .fact with beauty of language
than in the tragedy of King Michurd the Second. The action extends aver little more than the two
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the ,tre n gth and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the, astasein s stroke, Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with unsparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in'words so sweetly touching,
that the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with syoipatl v for woe, although
Brodueed by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. To show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it way be remarked that the same historical pagt
which is blotted with the recital of -murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory or
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dar»k clouds that obscured the political horiaon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable ** Canterbury Tales, not long before the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
John Wickliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation,' made bimselt heard amidst the angry roar
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
-rrowtb of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history The Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—
the Garden, where "Old Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his «unpleasing news"—the Great
Hall at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride ot kingly sway, and afterwards selected as the
lace where unkinged Richard was constrained " with bis own hands to give away his crown —the
Loyal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bohngbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
King " i n grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
i» tile speech ot York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
The few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Eoisode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in Lqndon
unwards of four hundred and fifty years since. The entire tableau may be considered as an historical
nicture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to surround the glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of wliich he writes—realizing-the scenes and actions which he
describes—exhibiting men as fliey once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
fftnius. Repeated success justifies the conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with the'general
teelinr When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no deroratory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that the
fours* I have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages

' ^ e ^ u M c ' & g h o u T S e piece, including the overture and entr'actes, has been composed and
adapted by Mr. J L Hatton, in accordance with the character of the period. The tune which
accompanies the Dance of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing the
e S c t - n t multftude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward he Second and
k n o w m i l H e d i n a woricby W. Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled "Popular Mus.c of the Olden
Time " Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the FooVs Dance is preserved m a manuscript written and
laminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in theDresses appropriated to
the Fools The Morris Dance, which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
lrom the Fool's Dance ; and thence are traced the bells which cbaractensedthe Morris dancers. The
Indent popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr actes
ortcedine the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
:..--«• t n k w i . alive the feelinr of regret tor King Richard's fate,

G l w r T G o d w i n Esq., F.S.A.; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
S l s t e f have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to

produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. To show the unportance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of «• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature arid reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smootfaeo
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury Tales," not long before the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
John Wickliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.

T U B two latest Shakespearean revivals at this theatre, namely. The Winter's Tale and Midswmm

and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of languag,

portance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical pag<
which is blotted with the recital of "murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory o
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chauoer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothei
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithless
ness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable '«Canterbury Tales," not long before th<
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
John Wickliffe, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roai
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after i
growth of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country
In the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediava
history. The Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—
the Garden, where "Old Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing news"—the Great

Quitting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return to the homestead of history, and
offer to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from »ur owq annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the fierce a n l turbulent passions of oor ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
the deepest interest to every E iglish mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Hiakeapeare; jit he still lives to the world with "his fan e unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. His historical plays present restrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic genius;
and nowhere has he more conn jicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
than in the tragedy of King I: ichor d the Second. The action extends aver little more than the two
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the assassin s stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with unsparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
that the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with sympatly for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. To show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of '• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and suiootben
our native tongue, imbibed the* same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable '' Canterbury Tales," not for- "—-'— -*throne of England was vielded to the vounger branch of the Plantagenets.

In the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. The Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—
the Garden, where "Old Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing news"—the Great
Hall at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as the
lace where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own hands to give away bis crown"—the
Loyal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
King, " i n grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in the speech ot York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
The few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode tire selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. The entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge---to surround the glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which he writes—realizing the scenes and actions which he
describes—exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely tied act from the enduring influence of his
;enius. Repeated success justifies the conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with the general
eeling. Wnen plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, 1 cannot be wrong in presuming tbat the
course I have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
The Music throughout the piece, iticluding the overture and entr' acles, has been composed and
adapted by Mr. J . L Hatton, in accordance with the character of the period. The tune which
accompanies the Dance of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W. Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled • Popular Music of the Ulden

This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the d a y " with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
a s facts by t h e credulous masses. T h e belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in t h e reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed t h e public mind in favor of supernatural
.subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed t h e play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
w e r e to be found, who gave ready credence to t h e reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from t h e popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
t h e inexhaustil.le genius of t h e poet has transmitted to posterity one of.the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. T h e enchanted island, governed by t h e wand of
Prospero, released from its association with t h e Bermudas, remains a n imaginary kingdom, t h e scene
o f affecting and mysterious incidents, over which Aritl presides as t h e image of air, in spiritual cont r a s t to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the earthly element.
I n t h e stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
T o the close of t h e third act, for instance, where " strange s h a p e s , " without any specified identity,
a r e described as bringing in a banquet, J have endeavoured to give a mythological character. I n a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for t h e entertainment ol Ferdinand and M i r a n d a ,
which Shakespeare has invested with t h e classical forms of antique goddesses and nymphs. I have,
therefore, deemed myself a t liberty to adopt a simitar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, w h o
invite the K i n g of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
h a v e taken t h e place of t h e ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with t h e classical figure of the H a r p y ,
w h i e h rises in the midst of them. T o preserve the mythological tone thioughout, t h e principal demons
a n d goblins commanded to torture t h e brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, T i i n c u i j i u i d S t e pliano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furie3 depicted on Ktruscan vases.
A g r e a t change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of M r . J . L .
H a t t o n , who, with t h e exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed t h e wbole of
t h e music. T o give full strength t > t h e vocal department, Miss Poole bus been specia'ly engaged to
a p p e a r as " J u n o " in t h e Masque, and to take t h e solo parts in the invisible chorusses wiiich pervade
t h e performance. T h e songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
spirit choir. I n the play of The Tempest, no allusion being madelto any definite period of action, I
h a v e exercised t h e liberty of selecting *he thirteenth century as a date for costume. T h e vessel lost
in t h e storm a t t h e commencement, and restored in t h e calm at the close of the piece, is also copied
from authentic records ol the same period.
T d e Scenery has been painted by M r , Grieve and Mr. Telbin ; and although a purely imaginative
d r a m a doe^ n o t a 1 nit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in earlier
Shakespearian r e v i r i l s a t this theatre, a n endeavor has been made, in the present instance, t o impart
a generally new ilia acter to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet,<*S»o supplied new
worlds with t h e rapidity of thought, a n d of whom it has been so j u s t l y written, " t h a t h e Jived, not

While t h e living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions t o t h e geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from t h e bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as t h e relation concerning
"' men whose heads stood in their breasts," in J>ir Walter Raleigh's voyage to G u i a n a in 1595'—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of E n g l a n d , destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, t h a t public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.

BARRENNESS S LUXURIANT VEGETATION

" I'/W Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are t h e noblest efforts of that sublime a n d
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above t h e bounds of nature without forsaki n g sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such af*
t h e words of one of onr poet's most learned commentators, Doctor W a r b u r t o n , Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of t h e genius which conceived and constructed t h e play of Hie Tempest.
T h i s wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylph-, and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in t h e world's
;u,nal.s.
D u r i n g the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
E u r o p e , the mind of man was repeatedly excited by t h e announcement of fresh wonders,. T h e inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and t h e names of Vasco de
G a m a , Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian (Jabot, Francis D r a k e , Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and h a s laid t h e foundation of those marvels which have emanated from t h e
philosophy of modern science. I t is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.

In 1609, about three years before t h e production of the play, the disastrous shipwreck of Sir
G e o r g e Somers h a d familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
t h e additi >n to Stowe's Annals, by H o w e s , were " said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
w i t h witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm a n d tempest
n e a r unto those islands."

A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J . L .
Hatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole «f
t h e music. To give full strength t J the vocal depattment, Miss Poole has been specially engaged t o

the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the

VIEW OF RLE US IS AND ITS TEMPLE,

In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
.are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms of antique goddesses and nymphs. I have,
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islander*, who
invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repa«t. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyr,,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the II
Wfaieh rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone thtoughont, the urine'
aud goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associate,, I«a-»
pbano, at fhe dote of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on fttrutcw-i vases.

This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day ' with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
a s facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed!
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who tirst witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustille genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of. the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand of
Pxospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, the scene
of affecting and mysterious incidents, over which Arid presides, as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the earthly element.

In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwieck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we Learn frenj
the addition to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were " said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
*- men whose heads stood in their breasts," in t»ir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a Btott
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror t o
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.

* -Die Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
OWazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsaking sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such are
the words of one of onr poet's most learned commentators, Doctor- Warbuiton, Bishop of Gloucester,
.conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempest.
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—amy be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasco de
Garna, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as brightmonuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced to great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated front the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwteck of Sir

" The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsaking sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such arc
the words of oue of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,

This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
trseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasco de

navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced So great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of pew objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.

•The kind indulgence of the public 1. requited ihould any lengthened delay take place between «!»,

This appeal is made with greater confidence when it is stated, that the Scenic Appliances of the play
are of a more extensive and complicated nature than have ever yet been attempted in any Theatre in Europe ;

This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day ' with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
-were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustiLle genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
•compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the waad at
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, the scene
of aftecting and mysterious incidents, over which Ariel presides as the image of air, tn spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
T o the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinund and Miranda,
which Shakespeare lias invested with the classical forms of antique goddesses and nymphs. 1 have,
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who
invite the King of Naples and bis attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
which rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone thioughout, the principal demons
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and bis drunken associates, Trincttlo and Stepbano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.

The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin; and although a purely imaginative
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in earlier
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to impart
a generally new character to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet, who supplied new

A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J . L .
Hatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give full strength O the vocal depaitment, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " J u n o " in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this btdy, as leader of the
spirit choir. In the play of The Tempest, no allusion being madelto any definite period of action, I
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lost

In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwieck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the addition to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were " said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."

" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.

MASQUE!

• The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsaking sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such ar*
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempest.
I b i s wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be -aid to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasco de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.

invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lord, to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyr*,
have taken the place ot the ludicrous and unmeaning monster, hitherto presented, as being sot only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with tbe classical figure of the Harpy,
wbieh rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, tbe principal demons
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trineuio and Stephano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Kt ruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J . L.
Hat ton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed tbe whole of
tbe music To give full strength t J the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " Juno" in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervade
tbe performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
spirit choir. I n tbe play ot The Tempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, I
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lost
in the storm at tbe commencement, and restored in the calm at the close of the piece, is also copied
from authentic records of tbe same period.
T h e Scenery has been painted by Mr, Grieve and Mr. Tel bin; and although a purely imaginative
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in earlier
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to import
a generally new character to one of the most lofty productions of that matter-poet, who supplied now
worlds with the rapidity of thought, and of whom it hat been so justly written, *- that he lived, net
for an age, hot for all time."

During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemispheretothe eyes of astonished

LIVING

While the living generation was j e t impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant legions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day ' with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustille genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand of
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Arid presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, T have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms ot antique goddesses and nymphs. I have,
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who
invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
which rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal demons
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trinculo and Stephano, at the. close of the fourth act, are copied from Furiea depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J . L ,
Hatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give full strength t j the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " J u n o " in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible cborusses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
spirit choir. In the play of The Tempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, I
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lost
m the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the close of the piece, is alto copied
from authentic records of the same period.
The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin; and although a purely imaginative
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in earlier
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to impart

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE TEMPEST

" The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsaking sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such are
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempest.
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of-Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vaseo de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
.navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant preaeirtation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from t h e
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwreck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in air Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most

compositions thai ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand of
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Arid presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms of antique goddesses and nymphs. I have,
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who
invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyr*,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
which rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal demons
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trinculo and Stephano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J . L .
Hatf on, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give full strength ti the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " J u n o " in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
spirit choir. In the play of The Tempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, f
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lost
in the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the close of the piece, is also copied
from authentic records of the same period
The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin; and although a purely imaginative
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in earlier
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to impart
a generally new character to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet, who supplied new
worlds with the rapidity of thought, and of whom it has been so justly Written, " that he lived, net
for an age, but for all time."

*« 2JW Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsak*
ing sense j or more properly, carries nature abng with him beyond her established limits," Such are
the word, of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempeii,
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs an,
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world',
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vaaco de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Waller Raleigh, and ether bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect ofthe entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant present,
ation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from tto
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 16*09, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwieck of Sit
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposedtobe enchanted, and inhabits.
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm ami tempest
near unto those islands."

In 1609, about three years before the production-'of the play, the disastrous shipwteck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
-• men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1S95—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day'' with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
sibjects, that .amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tetnpest, many, doubtless,

.From the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the irtexhaastiLle genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand of
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Arid preside, as the image of air, in spiritual contract to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
ore described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms ol antique goddesses and nymphs. I have,
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who
invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
wbieh rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal demons
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trincuto and Ste*
ph.no, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J. b>
Halt on, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give fall strength t s the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " Juno" in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
spirit choir. In the play of The Tempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, I
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lost
in the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the close of the piece, is also copied
from authentic records of the same period.
The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin j and although a purely itaaginative
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in earlier
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to impart
a generally new character to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet, who supplied «c*
verbis with the rapidity of thought, and of whom it has been so justly written, " that he lived, not
for an age, but for all time."

** The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsak.
"rig sense j or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such are
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived nnd constructed the play of The Tetttpest.
I b i s wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
-raeverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasco dc
una, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.

In 1609, about three year, before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwreck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with tbe Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
'- men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyagetoGuiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the dajr with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the report, circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced.

Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the

To the close or the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,

In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedeift.
To the close of the third act,forinstance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. Inja
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms ot antique goddesses and nymphs. I hare,
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, wAo
invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being sot only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
wbi.b rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone thioughout, the principal demon*
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trinculo and Stfepbano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan rases.

a generally new character to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet, who supplied » e w

from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origiit,
the inexhaustiLle genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. Toe enchanted island, governed by the wand of
Proapero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.

A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J L.
Hatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give full strength t i the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " Juno" in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
spirit choir. In the play ot The Tempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, I
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lets*

" The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime an 1

This wonderful dn.ma----tl.is bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs »t *

Europe, the mioAof man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspin d
perseverance of Cbturnbus had awakened a spirit not to be_extinguishcd, and the names of Vasco < r

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

TOP TTMPF vT
" 7'Ae Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Bream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsaking sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such are
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempest.
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasco de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwreck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation mav, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustible genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity onevof the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand of
JProspero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presidts as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, 1 have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment ot Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms ot antique goddesses and nymphs. 1 hare,
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who

whi«h rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal demons
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trinculo and Stephana, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J . L.

NIGHT

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE TEMPES

" The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and|
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without rbrsak>|
ing sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such art]
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester, I
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempsi,\
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in toe world's
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasco del
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant present.
ation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. I t is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwreck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."

While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions t o the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning j
•' men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most!
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so I
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day ' with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circa.
lated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustiLle genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand ot
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close ot the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment ot Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms ot antique goddesses and nymphs. I have,
therefore, deemc' vself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, wbo
invite the King of
pies and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
which rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal demon*
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Triuculo and Stepbano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J. L
Hattc*. who, with, the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the wbflle of
the music. To give full strength t> the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
pear as ** Juno" in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible churusses which pervade
e performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
pirit choir. In the play of The lempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, I
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lo*'
in the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the close of the piece, is also copitd
from authentic records of the same period.

S

The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin; and although a purely iina^itwttivt
drama does not admit of those historical details which ba^e been so accurately observed in earlier
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to impart
a generally new character to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet, who sapplied ne*
worlds with the rapidity of thought, and of whom it has been so justly written, " that he lived, no*

for aa age, bat far ail time,"

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

-HIP
TPMDPCT
1 nij 1 fjlurhi) 1
•> The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsaking sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such are
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempest.
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
Daring the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasco de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwieck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."

In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
arc described as bringing in a banquet, 1 have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare lias invested with the classical forms of antique goddesses and nymphs. I have,
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who
invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
whi.h rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone thioughout, the principal demons
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trinculo and Stephano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J . L.
Hatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give full strength t J the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " J u n o " in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
spirit choir. In the play of The lempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, I
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lost
in the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the close of the piece, is also copied
fron authentic records of the same period.
*
The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin ; and although a purely imaginative
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in earlier
u Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, ab endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to impart
a generally new character to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet, who supplied new
worlds with the rapidity of thought, and of whom it has been so justly written, " that he bred, not

MASQUE!

While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day'' with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustible, genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand of
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

TUP

..-. ,

" 2%* Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsaking sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such are
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempest.
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vases de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwreck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."

MONDAY, October 19th, 1857

In the stage arrangement, I have venturt d to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close ot the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I hare endeavoured to give a mythological character. I " *
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare lias invested with the classical forms ot antique goddesses and nymphs. I have,
therefore, deemed mysell at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, wbo
invit. the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
whi.h rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone tluoughout, the principal d—""»
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trinculo and Ste*
phano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J- L.
Hatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give full strength t} the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " Juno" in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of th*
spirit choir. In the play of The lempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, E
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel lost
in the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the close of the piece, is also copied
from authentic records of the same period.
The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin; and although a purely imaginative
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in ear-*"
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to imp-"4
a •generally new character to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet, who supplied ne*
world* with the rapidity of thought, and of whom it has been so justly written, " that he lived, no*
for at? age, but for all time."

While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in bir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The lempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustiLle genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the waisd of
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.

1 m. 1 M i 1-iJ 1 THE TEMPEST

" Tft* Temp-wi*, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forseking sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond ber established limits." Such are
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempest,
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world's
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement'of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vaseo de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect ofthe entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwreck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn fro.*
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
•f the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the hold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror H
oniversal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
a . facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the report, circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
.from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustible genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the waad ol
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, I have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. la *
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment oi Ferdinand and Mirands,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms ot antique goddesses and nymphs. I ha-ej
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed islanders, who
nvite the King of Naples and his attendant .Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
.ia ve taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in. accordance with the classical figure of the Harp",
which rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal d,.»-*id goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, 1 rincuio and St**
nano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases,
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J- E*
Hatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole el
the music To give full strength t> the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " J u n o " in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible ehorusses which per*-**
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as lender eft-*
•pint choir. In the play of The lempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, »
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a dateforcostume. The vessel h*j
in the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the close ofthe piece, is mho cop.**1
trom authentic records of the same period.
The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin; and although a purely imagin-"/*
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in" earli*"
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to i~,P**

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE TEMPEST

" The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime aw
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsak
ing sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such ar
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester
conveying a true estimate of the genius, which conceived and constructed the play of 2'he Temptt,
This wonderful drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylph, aad
spirits—may be said to symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world»
annals.
During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspire«
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasso d«
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bola
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so greni
a ehange in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presen.
atiou of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It-is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 16*09, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwreck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with tbe Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn htm
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempt it
near unto those islands."
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geograpfa;
ef the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concern!..-?
" m e n whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—an.»*t
fearful temp-** »wcpi the coast ot .England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror «>
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.

This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, whit
should combine a " topic of the day with those wonders of far countries which were greedily receive''
as facts by the credulons masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed.
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bernludas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of 2'he Tempest, many, doubtless
- were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustille genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating diamai..
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand oi
Prospe.ro, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, ia spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, 1 have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identic;,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character, lo ••
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Mirand••,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms ot antique goddesses and nymphs. I ban*
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, wh-\
invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyr*,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not onl"
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure of the Harpy,
wbi.h rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal demonand goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, 1 rinculo and Stephano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J-1Hatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs,-has composed the whole of
the music. To give foil strength t> the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged 1'
appear as " J u n o " in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervaaV
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of th
.pint choir. In the play of The Tempest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, I
pave exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a date for costume. The vessel 1"-;
in the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the elose of the piece, is also copi^
from authentic records of the same period.

The Scenery ta» been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin; and although a purely imaginati*«
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed ia earli**
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to imp*1*

While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
of the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance,, as the relation concerning
" inen whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day" with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustille genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand of
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, I have venturid to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms of antique goddesses and nymphs. 1 have)
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who
invite (he King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not only
more picturesque and poetical, but also more in accordance with the classical figure, of the Harpy,
which rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal demons
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trinculoand Stephano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan vases.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J . L.
Hattou, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give full strength t i the vocal depaitment, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " Juno" in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible choi usses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the
spirit choir. In the play of The Jetnpest, no allusion being made to any definite period of action, I
have exercised the liberty of selecting the thirteenth century as a dateforcostume. The vessel lost
in the storm at the commencement, and restored in the calm at the close of the piece, is also copied
from authentic records of the same period.
The Scenery has been painted by Mr. Grieve and Mr. Telbin ; and although a purely imaginative
drama does not admit of those historical details which have been so accurately observed in earlier
Shakespearian revivals at this theatre, an endeavor has been made, in the present instance, to impart
a genaplly new character to one of the most lofty productions of that master-poet, who supplied new
worlds with the rapidity of thought, and of whom it has been so justly written, " that he lived, not
for at.« age, but for all time."

A SHIP IN A STORM

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAT OF

Jn 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwieck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanter!, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."

During the century that followed the first revelation of a new hemisphere to the eyes of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasso de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other hold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced ao great
a change in the aspect ofthe entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.

THE BSLAND

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

E TEMPEST

*- The Tempest, and the Midsummer Night's Dream, are the noblest efforts of that sublime and
amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare, which soars above the bounds of nature without forsak*
ing sense; or more properly, carries nature along with him beyond her established limits." Such are
the words of one of our poet's most learned commentators, Doctor Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester,
conveying a true estimate of the genius., which conceived and constructed the play of The Tempest,
This wonderfuf drama—this bright creation of a sportive fancy which peoples the air with sylphs and
spirits—may be said so symbolize, almost as much as a historical play, a definite period in the world',
annals.
During t h . century that followed the first revelation or a new hemisphere to the ey«s of astonished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vase© de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which have emanated from the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Tempest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwieck of Sir
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from ,
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabited
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
«f the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation concerning
" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—it most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror so
universal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day ' with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
as facts by the credulous masses. Fhe belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of'TheTempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
from the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexbaustil.le genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by th* wand of
Prospero, released from Us association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, I have venturi d to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent.
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment of Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms of antique goddesses and nymphs. 1 bavej
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who

CHARLES K11A-W'

SHIP IN A STORM

RUT ONE

l.w-1 nil • i iiiiiaaBMR.

During the century that followed the first revelation or a new hemisphere to the eyes of a-toaished
Europe, the mind of man was repeatedly excited by the announcement of fresh wonders. The inspired
perseverance of Columbus had awakened a spirit not to be extinguished, and the names of Vasco de
Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Sebastian Cabot, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh, and other bold
navigators, remain as bright monuments of an age of discoveries, which has since produced so great
a change in the aspect of the entire world—has expanded the human intellect by the constant presentation of new objects—and has laid the foundation of those marvels which hare emanated front the
philosophy of modern science. It is this age of discoveries that is represented by The Temjtest.
In 1609, about three years before the production of the play, the disastrous shipwieck of Sit
George Somers had familiarized the multitude with the Bermuda Islands, which, as we learn from
the supplement to Stowe's Annals, by Howes, were "said and supposed to be enchanted, and inhabits,
with witches and devils, which grew by reason of accustomed monstrous thunder-storm and tempest
near unto those islands."
.
While the living generation was yet impressed with these wonderful additions to the geography
wf the globe's surface, and bewildered by the fabulous stories derived from the bold and unscrupulous
adventurers who had traversed those distant regions—such, for instance, as the relation conceroinf
" men whose heads stood in their breasts," in Sir Walter Raleigh's voyage to Guiana in 1595—a most
fearful tempest swept the coast of England, destroying hundreds of ships, and creating a terror se
•niversal, that public prayers were ordered, by authority, in the various churches.
This appalling visitation may, perhaps, have stimulated Shakespeare to compose a drama, which
should combine a " topic of the day ' with those wonders of far countries which were greedily received
aa facts by the credulous masses. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft, which at that period prevailed,
more or less, throughout all society, and which had found an additional aliment in the reports circulated with regard to the Bermudas, had so much disposed the public mind in favor of supernatural
subjects, that amongst the audiences who first witnessed the play of The Tempest, many, doubtless,
were to be found, who gave ready credence to the reality of the prodigies therein introduced. Apart
f am the popular superstitious belief of the time, to which, perhaps, the play partially owed its origin,
the inexhaustiLle genius of the poet has transmitted to posterity one of the most fascinating dramatic
compositions that ever sprang from human intellect. The enchanted island, governed by the wand of
Prospero, released from its association with the Bermudas, remains an imaginary kingdom, over which
Ariel presides as the image of air, in spiritual contrast to the grosser Caliban, who embodies the
earthly element.
In the stage arrangement, 1 have ventured to depart almost entirely from conventional precedent
To the close of the third act, for instance, where " strange shapes," without any specified identity,
are described as bringing in a banquet, I have endeavoured to give a mythological character. In a
later portion of the play, a Masque is performed for the entertainment ot Ferdinand and Miranda,
which Shakespeare has invested with the classical forms ot antique goddesses and nymphs. I have]
therefore, deemed myself at liberty to adopt a similar view with regard to the supposed Islanders, who
invite the King of Naples and his attendant Lords to their magical repast. Naiads, Dryads, and Satyrs,
have taken the place of the ludicrous and unmeaning monsters hitherto presented, as being not oalr

wfai.h rises in the midst of them. To preserve the mythological tone throughout, the principal demon.
and goblins commanded to torture the brute Caliban, and his drunken associates, Trinculo and Stephano, at the close of the fourth act, are copied from Furies depicted on Etruscan rase,.
A great change has been made in the orchestral arrangements, under the direction of Mr. J. LHatton, who, with the exception of a few favorite and well-known airs, has composed the whole of
the music. To give full strength t >: the vocal department, Miss Poole has been specially engaged to
appear as " Juno" in the Masque, and to take the solo parts in the invisible chorusses which pervade
the performance. The songs usually allotted to Ariel will be transferred to this lady, as leader of the

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T w o of the latest Shakespearean revivals at this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale and Midsummer
Wight's Dream, afforded opportunities ol illustrating the manners, costumes, and architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now leturn to the homestead of history, and
offer to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from »ur own annals, in which onr national
poet has depicted the fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
the deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakesp e a r e ; yet he still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and itnperishable. His historical plays present retrospective t r u t h , encircled by a halo of poetic genius •
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
than in the tragedy of King Richard the Second. T h e action extends over little more than the two
closing years of t h a t unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
t h e ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the assassin s stroke. Although the in firm) ties and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with nosparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
t h a t the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with s y m p a t l y for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. T o show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of •• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the rather of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
o u r native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury T a l e s , " not long before the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of t h e Plantagenets.
J o h n WiekiifTe, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after &
growth of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
I n the present stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. T h e Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Millord Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint
the G a r d e n , where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his " u n p l e a s i n g n e w s " — t h e Great
H a l l at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sWay, and afterwards selected as the
place where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own hands to give away his crown"—the
Royal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal entry into London of the " m o u n t i n g " Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " in grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
i n t h e speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
T h e f e w sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable event;
a n d are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in .London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
A n increasing taste tor recreation wherein instruction is "oiended with amusement, has tor some
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to sunound, the glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which he writes— -realizing the scenes and actions which he
describes—-exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies the conviction t h a t I am acting in accordance with the general
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded bat occasional icpetition, .<re enabled, by n o derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive m o n t h s , 1 cannot be wrong in presuming that the
course I have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including the overture and entr' actes, has been composed and
adapted by Mr. J . L- H a t t o n , in accordance with the character of the period. T h e tune which
accompanies the Dance of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W . Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled ** Popular Music of t h e Olden
Time."
Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in theDresses appropriated to
d i e Fools. T h e Morris D a n c e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from the Fool's D a n c e ; and thence are traced tbe bells which characterised,the Morris dancers. The
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet R i c h a r d , " introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' actei
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
served to keep alive t h e feeling of regret for K i n g Richard's fate.
T h e Privy Council Chamber, the restoration o f t h e Welsh Castles, the Traitor's G a t e at the Tower
and St. George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by Mr. Grieve and assistants) under the
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o H e n r y Shaw, Esq., F.SA., I am indebted for much
zealous assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending tbe preparations for
t h e combat at Coventry, the bed room of the dying J o h n of G a u n t , and many of the accessoriM
introduced into other scenes, T h e Garden at Langlev, the interior of the D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
t h e streets of Old L o n d o n , Westminster H a l l , and the Dungeon at Pom fret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while T h o m a s Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. 1 am also indebted to
G . Scharf, Esq , jun., F . S . A . , for many valuable suggestions.
T h e French metrical Iristory of the deposition of K i n g Richard the Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
tn its illuminated pages ; and the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
b r a n c h , has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
In addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
w i t h the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairbolt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement I guarantee the truthfulness and fidelity of tbe entire picture; while
I also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
for their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratify--'.;
encouragement to adhere to the plan of illustration L have hitherto adopted.

that the heart esponds to the poet's mighty influence, and thro.> teith sympatlv for woe, although
produced by wiong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-lit..»*<ring monarch. To show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotte with the recital of *• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory ot
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothes,
our native long, e, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of cdnfiictirg parties, and indited his ever-memorable "Canterbury Tales," not long before the
throne of Englaad was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
John Wicklife, " t h e morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending prssions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one r mdred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country,
In the present stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. The Ii'sts at Coventry—the Fleet at Miltord Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—
the Garden, wl t i e " O d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing news"—the Great
Hall at Westmii *ter, rebuilt by Richard, in bis pride bl kingly sway, and afterwards selected as the
place where un » aged lichard was constrained •« with his own hands to give away his crown"—the
Royal Chambei* m d t ; 3 Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contempo teous tuthorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal *»cry in o London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
King, " i n griet and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in the speech ot York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
The few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstanee$ of that remarkable event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. The entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is biended with amusement, has for tome
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—-to surround the glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments trite to the time of which he writes—rcuitzing the scenes and actions which he
describes—-exhibiting men us they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies the conviction that i am acting in accordance with the 'general
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, 1 cannot be wrong in presuming that the
course I have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
The Music throughout the piece, including the overture and entr' actes, has been composed and
adapted by Mr. J . L- Hatton, in accordance with the character of the period. The tune which
accompanies the Dance of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W, Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled "Popular Music of the Olden
Time." Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's Dance is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, < he Dancers being equipped in the Dresses appropriated lo
the Fools. The Morris Dance, which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to bare been derived
from the Fool's Dance ; and thence are traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. The
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' aetes
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, a).*1
served to keep alive the feeling of regret for King Richard's fate.
The Privy Council Chamber, the restoration of the Welsh Castles, the Traitor's Gate at the Tower
and St. George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by Mr. Grieve and assistants) under the
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. To Henry Shaw, Esq., F.SA., 1 am indebted for much
aealous assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending the preparations for
the combat at Coventry, the bed room of the dying John of Gaunt, and many of the accessories
introduced into other scenes. The Garden at Langley, the interior of the Dukeot Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of" Old London, Westminster Hall, and the Dungeon at Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F.S.A.; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
G. Scharf, Esq , jun., F.S.A:, for many valuable suggestions.
The French metrical history of the deposition of King Richard the Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in its illuminated pages ; and the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
In addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement I guarantee the truthfulness and fidelity of the entire picture; while
I also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has beeu so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
for their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to the plan of illustration I have hitherto adopted.

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T w o i f th« latest Shakespearean revivals at this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating the manners, costumes, and architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now ieturn to the homestead of history, and
offer to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from *.ur own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
the deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakespeare 5 yet he still lives to the world with "his fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. His historical plays present restrospective truth, encircled hy a halo of poetic genius;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
than in the tragedy of King Richard the Second. The action extends aver little more than the two
closing years o, that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, cxhib ing as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of anc her, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the. assassin s stroke. Although the infirmities aiid irresolution of RiciMvd's character are drawn with unsparing fidelity yet England's weak and erring king breathes his. ..irow in words s« sweetly touching,
that the heart esponds to the poet's mighty influence, and thro.' with sympatl y for woe, although
produced by wiong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-dtt wring monarch. To show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotte with the recital of «• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
aqd whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongie, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflictirg parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury Tales," not long before the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
John Wicklif e, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending pi ssions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one r indred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our aountry.
In the present stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. The l i s t s at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—
the Garden, w. t i e " O d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing news"—the Great
Hall at West-ail fter, ribuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as the
lace where un nged tichard was constrained " with his own hands to give away his crown"—the
Loyal Chambeis md t... Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contempo ieous minorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal ti.tiy in o London of the *• mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
King, " in griet and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in the speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play

and are added with the view of reviving, as tar as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. The entire tableau may be considered as an historical

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
Two of the latest Shakespearean revivals a t this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating t h e manners, costumes, a n d architecture of
ancient G r e e c e , as once co-existent in t h e cities of Syracuse "and Athens.
Quitting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, 1 now return to the homestead of history, and
o i e r t o the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from «ur own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the tierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised event, oi
- ' * deepest interest t o every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakesp e a i e ; yet h e ttill lives to t h e world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable a n d Imperishable. H i , historical plays present restrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic g e n i u s ;
a n d nowhere h s s he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in the trajedy of King Richard the Second. T h e action extends ever little more than t h e t w o
closing years o, that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhib ing as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of anc h e r , t h e gorgeous pageantry of royal state contra,ted with the dungeon and t h e a s sassin s stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Uichv.'d's character are drawn with unsparing fidelity yet England's weak a n d erring king breathes his. .trow in words so sweetly touching,
t h a t t h e heart esponds t o t h e poet's mighty influence, a n d t h r o . ' with s y m p a t l v for woe, although
produced by w i o n g , pitying t h e ill-fated, and pardoning t h e ill-de»-,trving monarch. T o show the importance of t h e period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that t h e same historical page
which is blotte with the recital of '• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured t h e political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoflrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoother.
our native tong« e, imbibed t h e same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflictirg parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury T a l e s , " not long before t h e
throne of Englacd was yielded to the younger branch of the P l a n t a g e n t t s .
J o h n Wicklif e, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending prssions. a n d in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed t h e seed, which, after a
growth of one 1 mired and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of o a r t o u n t r y .
In t h e preseti. stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. T h e Jt'sts a t Coventry—the Fleet at Mi I lord Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and F l i n t —
the G a r d e n , wl < -e " O d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his " unpleasing n e w s " — t h e Great
H a l l a t Westmii eter, r:built by Richard, in his pride ot kingly sway, and afterwards selected as t h e
place where uo aged lichard was constrained " with his own hands t o give away his crown**—-the
Royal Chambeif i n d t . : Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contempo l e o u s tuthorities. Between t h e third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal (Aery in o London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " i n griet and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
T h e few sentences intervening amidst t h e clamorous acclamations of t h e mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
event;
and are added with t h e view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which t h e creations of the painter's art a r e endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste tor recreation wherein instruction is mended with amusement, h a s for some
time been conspicuous in t h e English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive t o t h e diffusion of knowledge—to surround t h e glowing imagery of t h e g r e a t Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which h e writes—realizing the scenes and actions which be
describes—exhibiting men a s they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies t h e conviction t h a t 1 am acting in accordance with t h e genera
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that the
course I have adopted is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
• f a n overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture a n d entr' actes, h a s been composed and
adapted by M r . J . L H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of t h e period. T h e tune which
accompanies the D a n c e ol Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode fof the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as t h e reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W . Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " Popular Music of t h e Olden
Time."
Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's Dance is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in theDresses appropriated to
t h e Fools. T h e Morris D a n c e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from t h e Fool's D a n c e ; and thence a r e traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' actes
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, a n .
served t o keep alive the feeling of regret t o r K i n g Richard's fate.
T h e Privy Council Chamber, t h e restoration of t h e Welsh Castles, the Traitor's G a t e a t the Tower
and S t . George's Hall a t Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve and assistants) under the
authority of A nth it, "alvin, Es^., F.S.A. T o Henry Shaw, Esq., F.SA., I am indebted for much
sealous assistance, oesides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending t h e preparations for
the combat a t Coventry, the bed room of the dying J o h n of G a u n t , ami many of t h e accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e Garden a t Langley, the interior of the D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster H a l l , and the Dungeon at Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while Thomas Willcment, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
G . f'charf, Esq , jun., F.S.A., for many valuable suggestions.
T h e French metrical history of t h e deposition of K i n g Richard t h e Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in t h e British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in it* illuminated p a g e s ; and the knowledge of ray valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
In addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, ami Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement I guarantee t h e truthfulness and fidelity of the entire p i c t u r e ; while
I also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded t o me by men emit.*".'
for their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to t h e plan of illustration I have hitherto adopted.

than in the tragedy of King Richard the Second. The action extend,.". •
little more than the two
closing years o, that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventlS.-*1Je*™ which teach so terrible
a lesson, cxhib ing as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, tlMs elevation of one king upon
the ruin of ant her, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contra.ted i w t h the dungeon and the] assassin s stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Rich-vd s «character are drawn with unsparing fidelity yet England's weak and erring king breathes his- »irow i n words so sweetly touching,
that the heart esponds to the poet's mighty influence, and thro... with sympatlf v for woe, although
produced by wiong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-dt*.wring' monarcO. To show the haportance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked .that the same historical page
which is blotte with the recital of *» murders, treasons, and detested sim s," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetrjr, whose elegant taste refined and smoothen
our native tongs e, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faitlilessness of conflictirg parties, and indited his ever-memorable ** Canterbury Tales," not long before; the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Piantagenets.
John Wicklife, " t h e morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending pf ssions: and, in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, af ter a
growth of one r ndred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our eon ntry.
In the preser* stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of med: iseval
history. The l i s t s at Coventry—the Fleet at Miliord Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—
the Garden, w l c e " O d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing news"—the Great
Hall at Westm.i cter, rjbuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as Jthe
lace where un rged iichard was constrained " with his own hands to give away his crown"—t he
.oval Chambei. end t is Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformi ty
with conteinpo teous tuthorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal eii-ory in o London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captir.King, "in grief and patience j " thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described'
ha the speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
The few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable event ;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. The entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public, and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to surround the glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which he writes—realizing the scenes and actions which he
describes--exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies the conviction that I am acting in accordance with the 'genera
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that the
course I have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
The Music throughout the piece, including the overture and enlr actes, has been composed and
adapted by Mr. J . L- Hatton, in accordance with the character of the period. The tune which
accompanies the Dance of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expeetant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W. Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " Popular Music of the Olden
Time." Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's Dance is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in the Dresses appropriated to
the Fools. The Morris Dance, which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from the Fool's Dance : and thence are traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. The
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' actts
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, an!
served to keep alive the feeling of regret for King Richard's fate.
The Privy Council Chamber, the restoration of the Welsh Castles, the Traitor's Gate at the Tower
and St. George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by Mr. Grieve and assistants) under the
authority of AntK ny "'alvin, Esq., F.S.A. To He.ry Shaw, Esq., F.SA., I am indebted for much
zealous assistance, oesides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending the preparations for
the combat at Coventry, the bed room of the dying John of Gaunt, and many of the accessories
introduced into other scenes. The Garden at Langlev, the interior of the Duke of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster Hall, and the Dungeon at Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F.S.A.; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
6 . Scharf, Esq , jun., F.S.A., for many valuable suggestions.
The French metrical history of the deposition of King Richard the Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the co*t"i.me of the period
in its illuminated pages ; and the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
In addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Faii'holt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement I guarantee the truthfulness and fidelity of the entire picture; while

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T w o of the latest Shakespearean revivals at this theatre, namely, The fVinter's Tale and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating t h e manners, costumes, and architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting t h e far-famed regions of classical antiquity, 1 now return to the homestead of bistorv, and
*fF«r to t h e public one of those exciting dramas drawn from »ur own annals, in which o u r national
poet has depicted t h e fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
the deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two eenturie*. and a ii-!f divide us from Shakesp e a r e ; yet h e still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. H i . historical plays present restrospective truih, encircled by a halo of poetic g e n i u s ;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
than in t h e tragedy of King Jticfund the Second. T h e action extends .ver little more than the two
closing years o, that unhappy monarch's reign —those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exlub ing as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of a n t h e r , the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and t h e assassin s stroke. Although t h e infirmities and irresolution of Richm'e's character are drawn with uusparing fidelity yet England's weak and erring king breathes his. . . r o w in words so sweetly touching,
t h a t t h e heart esponds to the poet's mighty influence, a n d thro, v i t h syutpatl. v for woe, although
produced by wiong, pitying t h e ill-fated, and pardoning the ilI-dt-.»#Ting monarch. T o show the importance e l the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotte with the recital of " murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native long, e, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated witb the perjury and faithlessness of confiicth g parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury T a l e s , " not long before t h e
throne of England was yielded to t h e younger branch of the Plantagencts.
J o h n Wicklif e, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending pissions: a n d in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one I mdred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our eountrv.
I n t h e preset* stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. T h e Jt'sts at Coventry—the FJeet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and F l i n t —
the G a r d e n , wl < *e " O d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his " unpleasing n e w s " — t h e Great
H a l l a t Westmij fter, rsbuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as t h e
lace where uo taged tichaid was constrained " with bis own hands to give away his erown"—-the
loyal Chamben snd t . ! Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contempo t e o n s luthorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal ti.iry in o Loudon of the " m o u n t i n g " Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " i n grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play
T h e few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of t h e mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable event i
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is biended with amusement, has for -nine
time been conspicuous in the English public; a n d surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to surround t h e glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of winch h e writes—realizing the scenes and actions which he
describes—-exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely uetiact from the enduring influence of his
nius. Repeated success justifies the conviction t h a t 1 am acting in accordance with t h e 'genera
;iing. W h e n plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that t h e
course 1 have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of a n overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture and entr' actes, has been composed and
adapted by M r . .J. L H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of the period. T h e tune which
accompanies the D a n c e of Itinerant Fools, introduced m t h e Episode tor the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as (he reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W . ChappelT, Esq., F.S.A., entitled ' ' P o p u l a r Music of the Oldeu
Time."
Strut* remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's Dance is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in the Dresses- appropriated to
the Fools. T h e Morris D a n t e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from t h e Fool's p a n c e ; and thence are traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh «'rof " Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' octet,
preceding the third ac< and episode, is. supposed to be the production of some contemporary hard, a n .
served to keep alive t h e feeling of regret for K i n g Richard's fate.
T h e Privy Council Chamber, the restoration of the Welsh Caslles, the Traitor's G a t e at tire Tower
and St. George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve and assistants) under the
authority of AntK ny " * l - i n , Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry S h a w , Esq., F . S A . , 1 am indebted for much
zealous assistance, ncsides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending the preparations for
the combat at Coventry, the bed room of the dying J o h n of Gaunt, and many of the accessories
introduced iuto other scenes. T h e Garden at Langley, the interior of the D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster Hall, and the Dungeon at I'omliet, Ita^e been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Bulk*.
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for t h e heraldic adornments. 1 am also indebted to
G . J"charf, Esq , j u n . , F . S . A . , for nutnv valuable suggestions.
The French metrical history of the deposition of Kio«; Kichaid the Second, written by a content*
jj-urary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in its illuminated pages ; and the knowledge of my valued friend, I olouel Hamilton Smith, 111 this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my piesent undertaking.
I n addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement I guarantee the truthfulness and fidelity of the entire picture; while
I also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been *o liberally afforded to ate by men eminent
for their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
•pPfMirag-inea.; to adhere U> III, plan of illustration 1 have hitherto adoptr-J.

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T w o .f tli* latest Shakespearean revivals a t this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating t h e manners, costumes, a n d architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in t h e cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Q u i t t i n g the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now r e t u r n t o t h e homestead of history, and
-ffer t o t h e public one of those exciting dramas drawn from «ur own annals, in which o u r national
poet has depicted the fierce a n d turbuleat passions of our ancestors, a n d thus immortalised events of
t h e deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a ii-!f divide us from Shakesp e a r e ; yet h e still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable a n d imperishable. H i . historical plays present restrospective t r u t h , encircled by a halo of poetic genius ;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in t h e t r a j e d y of King Richard the Second. T h e action extends aver little more than t h e t w o
closing years o> that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhib ing as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
t h e ruin of a m h e r , the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the, assasbin s stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Ricbu'.c's character a r e drawn with*unsparing fidelity yet England's weak and erring king breathes his. ..row in words so sweetly touching,
that t h e heart esponos to the poet's mighty influence, a n d thro.' with sympatLy for woe, although
produced by wtong, pitying the ill-fated, a n d pardoning t h e i l l - d t . . u t i n g monarch. T o show the importance of t h e period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotte with t h e recital of «• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by t h e dark clouds that obscured t h e political horizon,
and whose names will tver remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smootheo
our native t o n g i e , imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with t h e perjury and faithlessness of conflictirg parties, and indited his ever-memorable '* Canterbury T a l e s , " n o t long before the
throne of England was yielded t o the younger branch of the PlantagenetS.
J o h n Wicklif e, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending pi ssions: a n d in the hearts of fiery a n d seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one 1 nidred and fifty years, was destined to expand into t h e standard religion of our country.
I n the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. T h e Ir'sts a t Coventry—the Fleet a t Milford H a v e n — t h e Castles of Pembroke and Flint
the G a r d e n , wl < -e " O d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "uftpleasing n e w s " — t h e Great
H a l l a t Westm.'i fter, n b u i l t by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as t h e
place w h e r e u o nged lichard was constrained " W i t h his own hands to give away his crown" t h e
Royal Chambei. i n d t : : Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, o r represented in conformity
with contempo . - ecus tuthorities. Between t h e third and fourth acts 1 have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal t a t t y in o London of the " m o u n t i n g " Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " i n grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech of York t o his Duchess, towards t h e close of t h e play
T h e few sentences intervening amidst t h e clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
event;
and are added with t h e view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upward* of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which t h e creations of the painter's a r t are endowed with animated reality.
A n increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is ..tended with amusement, has for some
time Iwen conspicuous in t h e English public; and surely, an attempt t o render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to surround the glowing imagery of t h e g r e a t Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which h e writes—realising
the scenes a n d actions which he
describes—exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely d e h a c t from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies the conviction t h a t 1 am acting in accordance with t h e 'genera
feeling. W h e n plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that the
course I have adopted is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture and entr' actes, has been composed and
adapted by M r . J . L- H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of t h e period. T h e tune which
accompanies the D a n c e of Itinerant Fools, introduced in t h e Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from a n air said t o be as old as the reign of Edward t h e Second, and
is now published in a work by W . Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " P o p u l a r Music of the Olden
Time."
S t r a i t remarks that a vestige of tlie Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Edward t h e Third, the Dancers being equipped in thoDresses appropriated to
t h e Fools. T h e Mortis D a n c e , which afterwards became so papular, is supposed to have been derived
from t h e Fool's D a n c e ; and thence a r e traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " S w e e t R i c h a r d , " introduced in the overture, and again in tliecntV' actes
preceding t h e third act and epfoew, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, a n .
served t o keep alive the feeling of regret for K i n g Richard's fate.
T h e Privy Council Chamber, the restoration o f t h e Welfh Castles, the Traitor's G a t e a t the Tower
and S t . George's Hall a t Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve a n d assistants) under t h e
authority of A oft ny "alvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry S h a w , Esq., F . S A . , I am indebted for much
.zealous assistance, oesides supplying the necessary drawings, und superintending t h e preparations for
t h e combitt a t Coventry, the bed room of t h e dying J o h n of G a u n t , and many of t h e accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e Garden a t Langley, the interior of t h e D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old L o n d o n , Westminster H a l l , and the Dungeon at I'omfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while T h o m a s Willement, Esq., F.S.A., a n d S i r Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. I a m also indebted to
G. Schart, Esq , j u n . , F . S . A . , for many valuable suggestions.
The French metrical history of the deposition ol King Ilk-hard the Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the perkd
in its illuminated pages ; and t h e knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, h a s been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
Jn addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in t h e British Museum, together
with the works of S t r a t i , Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By t h e preceding statement I guarantee t h e truthfulness and fidelity of t h e entire picture; white
I also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
or their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
CttCourageBWBt to adhere t o t h e plan of illustration 1 have hitherto adopted.

(The Three Daughter, of L.ar)

This play, perfect and unrivalled, as an embodiment of human misery, presents a harrowing

picture of filial ingratitude and paternal despair aggravated into madness.

The incident* «f the

tragedy are presumed to occur when the land was peopled with rude Heathens, and the mind and
A ' "he-jrt* of men, a* yet unreclaimed By the softening influences of Christianity, were barbarous and
d u e l . It would be useless to attempt any chronological representation of the costume and architecture
Monmouth, Romulus was yet unborn, Nitocris ruled in Egypt, and Isaiah prophesied in Israel.

I

hare, however, deemed it advisable to fix upon some definite epoch as the supposed time of action, if
Only for the sake of securing uniformity of character in the accessories of this great drama. The
Anglo-Saxon era of the eighth century has been selected for the regulation of the scenery and dresses
(avoiding all Christian symbols), as affording a date sufficiently remote, while it is, at the same time,
associated with British soil.

Ample information may be obtained respecting the military and civil

habiliment, of our early Saxon ancestors by referring to the delineations preserved in their manuscripts,

es of all edifices anterior to the Norman Conquest are few and insignificant, we can yet, with stlfch

materials as we possess, attain a degree of approximate truth absolutely impossible in the mythical age

to which Lear belongs. The tragedy, although essentially dependent on the exhibition of human feelings
and passions, still affords scope for the introduction of those illustrative adjuncts which have been so
successfully employed in many other Shakespearian revivals at this theatre.
«

•

i

In accordance, therefore, with the principle which has heretofore guided my efforts, and under
the firm belief that accuracy of detail is on all occasions not only necessary, but advantageous on the
stage, I trust that the attempt J have made in the present instance to realize a picture of early English
history, will be again accepted as a pleasing and instructive appendage to the intellectual lessons of
the author,"

Shakespeare,

** the famous city in the sea," rising like enchantment from the waves of the Adriatic, appeal,
to the imagination through a history replete with dramatic incident j wherein power and revolution-conqnest and conspiracy—mystery and romance—dazzling splendour and judicial murder alternate ievery page, A' hirteen hundred years witnessed the growth, maturity, and fall of this once celebrated
city; commencing in the fifth century, when thousands of terrified fugitives sought refuge in iti
numerous islands from the dreaded presence of Attila; and terminating when the last of the Doges,
in 1797, towered for ever the standard of St. Mark before the cannon of victorious Buonaparte.
Venice was born and died in fear. To every English mind, the Queen of the Adriatic is endeared by
the genius of our own Shakespeare. Who that has trod the great public square, with its mosque-like
cathedral, has not pictured to himself the forms of the heroic Moor and the gentle Desdemona? Who
that has landed from his gondola to pace the Rialto, has not brought before his " mind's eye," the
scowling brow of Shylock, when proposing the bond of blood to his unsuspecting victim ? Shakespeare
may or may not have derived his plot of The Merchant of Venice, as some suppose, from two separate
Stories contained in Italian novels; but it such be the fact, he has so interwoven the double interest,
that the two currents flow naturally into a stream of unity
VRNICE,

In this play Shakespeare has bequeathed to posterity one of his most perfect works—powerful
in its effect, and marvellous in its ingenuity. While the language of the Jew is characterized by an
assumption of biblical phraseology, the appeal of Portia to the quality of mercy is invested with
heavenly eloquence elevating the poet to sublimity.
From the opening to the closing scene,—from the moment when we hear of the sadness,
prophetic of evil, which depresses the spirit of Antonio, till we listen at the last to the " playful
prattling of two lovers in a summer's evening," whose soft cadences are breathed through strains ef
music,—all is a rapid succession of hope, fear, terror, and gladness ; exciting our sympathies now for
the result of the merchant's danger; now for the solution of a riddle on which hangs the fate of the
wealthy heiress; and now for the fugitive Jessica, who resigns ttei creed at the shrine of womanly
affection.
In the production of The Merchant of Venice it has been my object to combine with the poet's
art a faithful representation of the picturesque city ; to render it again palpable to the traveller who
has actually gazed upon the seat of its departed glory; and, at the same time, to exhibit it to the
student, who nas never visited this once
pleasant place of all festivity,
" Th« revet of the earth, the masque of Italy.
The far-famed place of St. Mark, with its ancient Church, the Rialto and its Bridge, the Canals and
Gondolas, the Historic Columns, the Ducal Palace, and the Council Chamber, are successively
presented to the spectator. Venice is re-peopled with the past, affording truth to the eye, and
reflection to the mind.
The introduction of the Princes of Morocco and Arragon at Belmont, hitherto omitted, is
restored, for the purpose of more strictly adhering to the author's text, and of heightening the interest
attached to the episode of the caskets.
The costumes and customs are represented as existing about the year 1600, when Shakespeare
wrote the play. The dresses are chiefly selected from a work by Cesare Vecellio, entitled " Degli
Habiti Anticbi e Moderni di diverse Parti del Mondo. In Venetia, 1590;" as well as from other
sources to be found in the British Museum, whence 1 derive my authority for the procession of the
Doge in the first scene.
If the stage is to be considered and upheld as an institution from which instructive and
intellectual enjoyment may be derived, it is to Shakespeare we must look as the principal teacher, to
inculcate its most valuable lessons. It is, therefore, a cause of self-gratulation, that 1 have on many
occasions been able, successfully, to present some of the works of the greatest dramatic genius the
world has known, to more of my countrymen than have ever witnessed them within the same space of
time; and Jet me hope it will not be deemed presumptuous to record the pride 1 feel at having been
•o fortunate a medium between our national poet and the people of England

If the stage is t o be considered a n d upheld as an institution from which instructive and
intellectual enjoyment may be derived, it is to Shakespeare we must look as the principal teacher, to
inculcate its most valuable lessons. It is, therefore, a cause <>f self-gratulatton, that I have on many

" the famous city in the sea," rising like enchantment from the waves of the Adriatic, appeal,
t» the imagination through a history replete with dramatic incident; wherein power and revolution —
conquest and conspiracy—mystery and romance—dazzling splendour and judicial murder alternate in
ererypage. Thirteen hundred years witnessed the growth, maturity, and fall of this once celebrated
city; commencing in the fifth century, when thousands of terrified fugitives sought refug. in its
numerous islands from the dreaded presence of Attila; and terminating when the last of the Doges,
in 1797, lowered tor ever the standard of St. Mark before the cannon of victorious Buonaparte.
Venice was born and died in fear. To every English mind, the Queen of the Adriatic is endeared by
the genius of our own Shakespeare. Who that has trod the great public square, with its mosque-like
cathedral, has not pictured to himself the forms of the Iterate Moor and the gentle Desdemona? Who
that has landed from his gondola to pace the liialto, has not brought before his "mind's eye," the
scowling brow of Shylock, when proposing the bond of blood to his unsuspecting victim ? Shakespeare

In this play Shakespeare has bequeathed to posterity one of his most perfect works—powerful
in its effect, and marvellous in its ingenuity. While the language of the Jew is characterized by an
assumption of biblical phraseology, the appeal of Portia to the quality of mercy is invested with a
heavenly eloquence elevating the poet to sublimity.

In the production of The Merchant of Venice it has been my object to combine with the. poet',
art a faithful representation of the picturesque city; to render it again palpable to the traveller who
hat actually g«zed upon the seat of its departed glory ; and, at the same time, to exhibit it to the
student, who ha? never visited this o n e .
pleasant place of all festivity,
" The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy.''
The far-famed place of St. Mark, with its ancient Church, the Rialto and its Bridge, the Canals and
Gondolas, the Historic Columns, the Ducal Palace, and the Council Chamber, are successively
presented to the spectator. Venice is re-peopled with the past, affording truth to the eye, and
.reflection to the mind.

mMBiaHNMPSNMW W w flMH.IMHflB~MH.iEi M B
OF

" the famous city in the sea," rising like enchantment from the wares of the Adriatic, appeal.
to the imagination through a history replete with dramatic incident; wherein power and revolution —
conquest and conspiracy—mystery and romance—dazzling splendour and judicial murder alternate in
erery page. Thirteen hundred years witnessed the growth, maturity, and fall of this once celebrated
city j commencing in the fifth century, when thousands of terrified fugitives sought refuge in its
numerous islands from the dreaded presence of Attila; and terminating when the last of -he Doges,
ia 17-7, lowered for ever the standard of St. Mark before the cannon of victorious Buonaparte.
Venice was born and died in fear. To every English mind, the Queen of the Adriatic is endeared by
the genius of our own Shakespeare. Who that has trod the great public square, with its mosque-like
cathedral, has not pictured to himself the forms of the heroic Moor and the gentle Desdemona ? Who
that has landed from his gondola to pace the Rialto, has not brought before his " mind's eye," the
scowling brow of Shylock, when proposing the bond of blood to his unsuspecting victim ? Shakespeare
may or may not have derived his plot of The Merclianf of Venice, as some suppose, from two separate
atones contained in Italian novels , but it such be the fact, he has so interwoven the double interest,
that the two currents flow naturally into a stream of unity.
In this play Shakespeare has bequeathed to posterity one of his most perfect works—powerful
in its effect, and marvellous in ks ingenuity. While the language of the Jew is characterized by an
assumption of biblical phraseology, the appeal of Portia to the quality of mercy is invested with a
heavenly eloquence elevating the poet to sublimity.
From the opening to the closing scene,—from the moment when we hear of the sadness,
prophetic of evil, which depresses the spirit of Antonio, till we listen at the last to the " playful
prattling of two lovers in a summer's evening," whose soft, cadences are breathed through strains of
music,—all is a rapid succession of hope, fear, terror, and gladness; exciting our sympathies now far
the result of the merchant's danger ; now for the solution of a 1 iddle on which hangs the fate of the
wealthy heiiess ; and now for the fugitive Jessica, who resigns her creed at the shrine of womanly
affection.
In the production of The Merchant of Venice it has been my object to combine with the poet's
art a faithful representation of the picturesque city; to render it again palpable to the traveller who
has actually gazed npon the seat of its departed glory; and, at the same time, to exhibit it to the
student, who nas never visited this once
«1 ,
pleasant place of all festivity,
" The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy."
The far-famed place of St. Mark, with its ancient Church, the Rialto and its Bridge, the Canal, and
Gondolas, the Historic Columns, the Ducal Palace, and the Council Chamber, are successively
presented to the spectator. Venice is re-peopled with the past, affording truth to the eye, and
reflection to the mind.
The introduction of the Princes of Morocco and Arragon at Belmont, hitherto omitted, it
restored for the purpose of more strictly adhering to the author's text, and of heightening the interest
attached to the episode of the caskets.
The costumes and customs are represented as existing about the year 1600, when Shakespeare
wrote the play. The dresses are chiefly selected from a work by Cesare Vecellio, entitled *' Degli
Habiti Antichi e Moderni di diverse Parti del Mondo. In Venetia, 1590;" as well as from other
sources to be found in the British Museum, whence I derive my authority for the procession of the
Doge in the first scene.
If the stage is to be considered and upheld as an institution from which instructive and
intellectual enjoyment may be derived, it is to Shakespeare we must look as the principal teacher, to
inculcate its most valuable lessons. It is, therefore, a cause of self-gratulation, that I have OH many
occasions been able, successfully, to present some of the works of the greatest dramatic genius the
world has known, to more of my countrymen than have ever witnessed them within the same space oi
time; and lot me hope it will not be deemed presumptuous to record the pride I feel at having been
ao fortunate a medium between our national poet and the people of England.

VENICE

VBNICK, - the famous city in the sea," rising like enchantment from the waves of the Adriatic, appeals
to the imagination through a history replete with dramatic incident; wherein power and revolution —

conquest and conspiracy—mystery and romance—dazzling splendour and judicial murder alternate in

every page. Thirteen hundred years witnessed the growth, maturity, and fall of this once celebrated
city; commencing in the fifth century, when thousands of terrified fugitives sought refuge in its

If the stage is to be considered and upheld as an institution from which -instructive and
intellectual enjoyment may be derived, it is to Shakespeare we must look as the principal teacher, to
ineulsjste if. most valuable lessons, i t is, therefore, a cause of self-gratnlation, that 1 have on many
oeea.iens been able, successfully, to present some of the works of t h e greatest dramatic genius the
wnrld has known, to more of my countrymen than have ever witnessed them within the same .pane-of
t i m e ; and let me hope it will not be deemed presumptuous to record the pride 1 "ss-el a t having been
so fortunate a medium fee-eveen e m national poet and the people of England,

T h e cnM nines and customs are represented as existing about the year 1S00, when Shakespeare
wrote the play. T h e dresses a r e chiefly selected from a work by Cesare Veeellio, entitled " D e g K
Habiti Antichi e Moderni di diverse Parti del Mondo. In Venetia, 1S90;" as well as from other
aouree* to be found in t h . British Museum, whence I derive my authority for the procession of the
Doge in the first scene.

From t h e . p e a i a g « . t h e closing scene,—from t h e moment when we hoar ef the sadness,
prophetic of evil, which d e p r e s s . , t h . spirit of Antonio, till we listen at the last t . t h e "playful

music,—all is a rapid succession of h . p . , fear, terror, and gladness ; ex'iting .ur sympathies now for

In this play 8 r . a k . s p e . r e has bequeathed to posterity one of his most perfert w-rks—powerful
in its effect, and asarvellons in its ingen.ity. While t h e language of the J e w is ehara.ttmi.ed by a a
assumption of biblical p h r a s . . l o g y , the appeal .f Portia t o t h e quality of mercy is invested with a
heavenly .l.qaano.

Vmnea, " the famous city in the sea," rising like enchantment from the wares of the Adriatic, appeals
to the imagination through a history replete with dramatn. incident; wherein power and revolution —
•MtwyMrst and conspiracy—mystery and romance—dazzlinf splendour and judicial murder alternate m
«,«ry page. Thirteen hundred years witnessed th« growth, maturity, and fall of this once celebrated
•Sty; co-nnencing in the fifth century, when thousand* el terrified fugitives sought refuge HI its
auwrerons islands from the dreaded presence of Attna; -ua terminating when the last of the Doges,
m M#7, lowered 8>r ever the standard of St. Mark tnstore the cannon of victorious Buonaparte.
Venice was born and died in fear. To every English mind, the Queen of the Adriatic js endeared by
the genius of our own Shakespeare. Who that has trod the great public square, with its mosquehke
cathedral, has not pictured to himself the forms of the her.ic Moor and the gentle Desdemona ? Who
that has landed from his gondola to pace the Rialto, has not brought before his " mind's eye," the
mewling brow of Shylock, when proposing, the bond of blood to his unsuspecting victim ? Shakespeare
may er way not hare derived his plot of The Merchant of Venice, as some suppose, from two separate
contained in Italian novels; but it sutA be *» fact, he has so interwoven the double interest,
tlte twe cm-vents flow naturally into a stream of unity.
In Ibis play Shakespeare has bequeathed to posterity one of his most perfect woi ks—powerful
in its effect, and marvellous in its ingenuity. While the language of the Jew is characterized by an
assumption of biblical phraseology, the appeal of Portia to the quality of mercy is invested with a
heavenly eloquence elevating the poet to sublimity.
Prom the opening to the closing scene,—from the moment when we hear of the sadness.
frosbettc of evil, which depresses the spirit of Antonio, till we listen at the last to the " playful
orattKng of two lovers in a summer's evening," whose soft cadences are breathed through strains of
mwrev',—ail is a rapid succession/*!' hope, fear, terror, and gladness ; exciting our sympathies now for
the result ol the merchnnt's danger; now for the solution of a riddle on which hangs the late of .the
wealthy heir ess; and now for the fugitive Jessica, who resigns hei creed at the shrine of womanly
affection.
In the production of The Merchant of Venice it has been my object to combine with the poet's
art a faithful representation of the picturesque city ; to render it again palpable to the traveller who
h a , actually gazed upon the seat of its departed glory; and, at the same time, to exhibit it to the
student, who has never visited this once
«.
pleasant place of all festivity,
- The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy."
The far-famed place of St. Mails, wi<h its ancient Church, the Rialto and its Bridge, the Canals and
Gondolas the Historic Columns, the Ducal Palace, and the Council Chamber, are successively
.rcsvnted' to the spectator. Venice is rc-peoplcd with the past, affording truth to the eye, and
reflection to the mm*t
The introduction of the Prinees of Morocco and Arrngon at Belmont, hitherto omitted, is

attached to the episode of the caskets.
The costumes and customs are represented as existing about the year 1S00, when Shakespeare
wrote the play. The dresses are chiefly selected from a work by Cesare Vecellio, entitled **D«-li
Habiti Antichi e Moderoi di diverse Parti del Mondo. In Venetia, 1*90," as well as from other
sources to be found in the British Museum, whence I derive my authority for the procession of the
Doge iu tbe first scene.
If the stage Is to be considered and upheld as an institution from which instructive and
intellectual enjoyment may be derived, it is to Shakespeare we must look as the principal teacher, to
inculcate its most valuable lessons. I t is, therefore, a cause of self-gratulation, that I have on many
occasions been able, successfully, to present some of the works of the greatest dramatic genius the
world has known, to more of my ceuntrymen than have ever witnessed them within the same spa-tea
time; and let me hope it will not be deemed presumptuous to record the pride I feel at having been

w iortnaate a m^ius, be*w^-pux natiapal poet and the people of England.

in I797, lowered for ever the standard of St. Marx u-nure the cannon of victorious Buonaparte.
Venice was born and died in fear. To every English mind, the Queen of the Adriatic is endeared by
the genius of our own Shakespeare. Who that lias trod the great public square, with its mosque-like
cathedral, has not pictured to himself the forms of the liereic Moor and the gentle Desdetnona? Who
that has landed from his gondola to pace the Rialto, has not brought before his " mind's eye," the
scowling brow of Shylock, when proposing the bond of blood to his unsuspecting victim ? Shakespeare
mayor may not have derived his plot o( The Merchant oj f^eitice, as some suppose, from two separate
stories contained in Italian novels; but it such be t* tact, he has so interwoven the double interest,
' that the two currents flow naturally into a stream of umty.
VSKICX,

In this play Shakespeare has bequeathed to posterity one of his most perfect works—powerful
in its effect, and marvellous in its ingenuity. While the language of the Jew is characterized by an
assumption of biblical phraseology, the appeal of Portia to the quality of mercy is invested with a
heavenly eloquence elevating the poet to sublimity.
From the opening to the closing scene,—from the moment when we hear of the sadness,
prophetic of evil, which depresses the spirit of Antonio, till we listen at the last to the " playful
prattling of two lovers in a summer's evening," whose soft cadences are breathed through strains ef
music,—all i s . rapid succession of hope, fear, terror, and gladness ; exciting our sympathies now for
the result of the merchant's danger ; now for the solution of a riddle on which hangs the fate of the
wealthy heiiess ; and now for the fugitive Jessica, who resigns her creed at the shrine of womanly
affection.
In the production of The Merchant of Venice it has been my object to combine with the poet's
art a faithful representation of the picturesque city; to render it again palpable to the traveller who
has actually gazed upon the seat of its departed glory; and, at the same time, to exhibit it to the
student, who has never visited this once
pleasant place of .11 festivity,
*' The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy."
The far-famed place of St. Mark, with its ancient Church, the Rialto and its Bridge, the Canals and
Gondola,, the Historic Column*, the Ducal Palace, and the Council Chamber, are successively
.resented to the spectator. Venice is re-peopled with the past, affording truth to the eye, and
reflection to the mind.
The introduction of the Princes of Morocco and Arragon at Belmont, hitherto omitted, is
restored, for the purpose of more strictly adhering to the author's text, and of heightening the interest
attached te the episode of the caskets.
The costumes and customs are represented as existing about the year IriOO, when Shakespeare
wrote the play. The dresses are chiefly selected from a work by Cesare Vecellio, entitled " l>egli
Habiti Antichi e Moderni di diverse Parti del Mondo. In Venetia, 1500;" as well as from other
sources to be found in the British Museum, whence I detive my authority for the procession of the
Doge in the first scene.
If the stage is to be considered and upheld ss an institution from which instructive and
intellectual enjoyment may be derived, it is to Shakespeare we must look as the principal teacher, to
inculcate its most valuable lessons. It is, therefore, a cause of self-gratulation, that 1 have on many
occasions been able, successfully, to present some of the works of the greatest dramatic genius the
world has known, to more of uiy country men than have ever witnessed them within the same Space of
time; and lot me hope it will not be deemed presumptuous to record the pride 1 feel at having been
ao fortunate a medium between our national poet and the people of England.

in this play Shakespeare has bequeathed to posterity one of bis most perfect works—powerful
ia its effect, and marvellous in its ingenuity. While the language of the Jew is characterized by an
assumption of biblical phraseology, the appeal of Portia to the quality of mercy is invested with a
heavenly eloquence elevating the poet to sublimity.
From tbe opening to the closing scene,—from the moment when we hear of the sadness,
prophetic of evil, which depresses the spirit of Antonio, till we listen at the last to the " playful
prattling of two lovers in a summer's evening," whose soft cadences are breathed through strains of
music,—all is a rapid succession of hope, fear, terror, and gladness ; exciting our sympathies now for
the result of the merchant'* danger j now for the solution of a riddle on which hangs the fate of the
wealthy heiiess; and now for the fugitive Jessica, who resigns her creed at the shrine of womanly
affection.
In the production of The Merchant of Venice it has been my object to combine with the poet',

has actually r u e d upon the seat of its departed glory; and, at the same time, to exhibit it to the

'* The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy."
The far-famed place of St. Mark, with its ancient Church, the Rialto and its Bridge, the Canals and
Gondolas, the Historic Columns, the Ducal Palace, and the Council Chamber, are successively
presented to the spectator. Venice is re-peopled with the past, affording truth to t h . eye, and
refection to the mind.
The introduction of the Princes of Morocco and Arragon at Belmont, hitherto omitted, is
restored for the purpose of more strictly adhering to the authors text, and of heightening the interest
attached to the episode of the caskets.
The costumes and customs are represented as existing about the year 1600, when Shakespeare
wrote the play. The dresses are chiefly selected from a work by Cesare Vecellio, entitled " Degli
Habiti Antichi e Moderni di diverse Parti del Mondo. In Venetia, 1590;" as well as from other
sources to be found in the British Maseum, whence 1 derive my authority for the procession of the
Doge in the first scene.
If the stage is to be considered and upheld as an institution from which instructive and
intellectual enjoyment may be derived, it is to Shakespeare we must look as the principal teacher, to
inealcate its most valuable lessons, i t is, therefore, a cause of sclf-gratulation, that I have on many
occasions been able, successfully, to present some of the works of the greatest dramatic genius the
world has known, to more of my countrymen than have ever witnessed them within the same space of
time; and let ma hope it will not be deemed presumptuous to record the pride I feel at having been
to fortunate a medium between our national poet and the people of England.

VXNICS, •• the famous city in tbe sea," rising like enchantment from the waves of the Adriatic, appeals
to the imagination through a history replete with dramatic incident; wherein power and revolution —
coaaue-t and conspiracy—mystery and romance— dazzling splendour and judicial murder alternate in
er-ry page. Thirteen fiundred years witnessed the growth, maturity, and fall of this once celebrated
city; commencing in the fifth century, when thousands et terrified fugitives sought refuge in it.
numerous islands from the dreaded presence of A u n a . a..o terminating when the last of the Doges,
in 1797, lowered for ever the standard of St. Mara owtm. the cannon of victorious Buonaparte.
Venice was born and died in fear. To every English mind, the Queen of the Adriatic is endeared by
the genius of our own Shakespeare. Who that has trod the great public square, with its mosque-like
cathedral, has not pictured to himself the forms of the her.ic Moor and the gentle Desdemona ? Who
that has landed from his gondola to pace the Rialto, has not brought before his " mind's eye," the
scowling brow of Shylock, when proposing the bond of blood to his unsuspecting victim ? Shakespeare
mayor may not have derived his plot ol The Merchant of Venice, as some suppose, from two separate
stories contained in Italian novels; but it su»,-h be h tact, he has so interwoven the double interest,
that the two currents flow naturally into a stream of unity.

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

MERCHANT

Y I N G FOR L O V E

In this play Shakespeare has bequeathed t o posterity one of his most perfect works—powerful
in its effect, and marvellous in its ingenuity. While t h e language of the J e w is characterized by an
assumption of biblical phraseology, the appeal of Portia to t h e quality of mercy is invested with a
heavenly eloquence elevating the poet to sublimity.

prattling of two lovers in a summer's evening," whose soft cadences are breathed through strains of
music,—all is a rapid succession of hope, fear, terror, and gladness ; exciting our sympathies now for
the result of the merchant's danger ; now for the solution of a riddle on which hangs the fate of the
wealthy h e i i e s s ; and now for t h e fugitive Jessica, who resigns her creed at the shrine of womanly
affection.

SCENE 3.

INTERIOR OF THE TEMPLE CHURCH

A lone woman stands in the midst of chivalry, encircled by the din of battle, the emblem of
despair and ruined majesty. Her bursts of agony as she cries aloud for " h e r boy, her joy, her life,
her widow', comfort, and her sorrow's cure," combine the most soul-thrilling picture of maternal
suffering ever adorned and enhanced by poetic imagery. The youthful Arthur n painted a. a tender
and innocent child--not a* the leader of an a m y , and the affianced husband of a princess ;—that he
may twine more closely round the heart, and win bath sympathy and love. He is the centre from
which every scene radiates j and in the spirit of retributive justice, the misfortunes of fcnglanrt
appear as the consentient result of the wrongs inflicted by its unscrupulous monarch on his helpless
nephew. The injured and unhappy bov becomes the source of every current ot action throughout
the play; and the lineaments of his faithless uncle are rendered palpable to the eye in all the
hideousness of guilt. The character of John is presented with strict fidelity throughout and is
especially displayed when he pours forth his wicked design into the ear ot Hubert, and afterwards
when he upbraids his chosen tool for supposed obedience to his commands.
Though motives influential at the time when the play was written doubtless prevented Shakespeare
from alluding to the remarkable political event that renders the reign of John all important in the
eyes of the constitutional historian, we cannot, at the present day, refrain from extending our vision
beyond the limits of the scene, and reflecting upon the inscrutable ways of Providence.
is man of sin, this violator of every law, human and divine, becomes the instrument by which
This
rty of England was founded. His very enormities furnish the occasion of that invaluable boon
the libertywrung from the "Royal felon by his angry and excited Barons; and to the hand of a murderer is this
country indebted for the signature which establishes the Great Charter of English Freedom.
There is little difficulty in collecting safe authority for the costume of King John's reign.
Tapestry, illuminated manuscripts, and tombs, supply abundant evidence. The habits of many of the
principal characters are copied from monumental effigies, care having been taken that those who outlived King John, and were buried under the sovereignly of Henry the Third, are not clothed iit
emblazoned surcouts, which appear on their respective tombs, since no instance of such ornament
occurs before the year 1250.
Coeval ruins still in existence bear correct testimony of Norman architecture. The Room of
State in the first act is copied from the Hall in Rochester Castle. Each succeeding scene is arranged
from specific remains of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
This play has been revived by me, with the view of adding another to the list of Shakespeare's
historic dramas presented at this Theatre, tinder the belief that liistory, heightened by the charm of
the most exquisite poetry, and combined with pictorial and correct embellishment, tends to promote
the educational purposes for which the st.ge i- so pre-eminently adapted; and also with a sincere
desire that I maybe so tar useful in the s| here of action in which my lot has been cast, as to convey
information to the general public through the medium of refined amusement,

with the inspiration of genius, has converted the histories of sevetn of our rlnglish

With a single exception, the canvas reflects portraits of the Plantagcnet line, commencing with
