NEW SONG,
To be sung by Mr. IV. REES, at the Theatre-Royal, On Wednesday, Dec. 10, 1823.
'TIS a very strange thing I am going to sing.
What you'll find dre I come to a close,
Whether mankind, or all those that arn’t blind,
Are the better or worse for a Nose!
I’ve bother'd my brains, and taken great pains,
To grapple each thought as it rose;
And now, as you’ll find, I’ve made up my mind,
A man is a gainer by losing his Nose!
A good reason’s here, it makes him see clear;
At least, so I think and suppose ;
For he, if he’s wise, will go by his eyes,
And never will follow his Nose.
Toll loll, &c.
He bears, without doubt, the loss of his Snout;
It doesn’t exempt him from woes,
But into the cares of his neighbour’s affairs He ne'er can be poking his Nose;
And tho’, in his dress, he cannot do less,
Than wear, just like other folks, clothes, Pocket-handkerchiefs he does without, and we see There's a saving in soap, for he ne'er blows his Nose; And to say it I'm bold, if he catches cold By winds, by rains, or by snows, .
He may make himself glad, for tho’ ever so bad,
He’s never stuff’d up in his Nose.
He smokes well enough, tho’ he cannot take snuff; And when he’s inclin’d for a doze,
He sits in his chair: goes to sleep without care,
For no one can tickle his Nose;
And further, now mark, if he runs in the dark,
(For darkness will many folks pose,)
He may by surprise, knock out both his eyes,
But he can ne’er ’gainst a post rim his Nose.
If he drink day and night, and in liquor delight,
Till he cannot stand up on his toes ;
Though his neighbours say whatever they may,
They cannot say, he’s got a red Nose.
If he gets a nick-name, he comes off the same ;
They cannot call him “Nosey,” he knows ;
And tho’ he is vex'd, and by troubles perplex'd,
He never can bite off his Nose.
Though his false friends, for their own private ends, , His suspicions may lull to repose,
Disappointment they’ll gain, and find it in vain To try to lead him by the Nose ;
Nay, more, this is sure, be he rich or poor,
Or fighting with five or six foes,
He'll bear off the bell, and proud I'm to tell,
Not one can take him by the Nose. ,
Perhaps you’ll surmise, he’ll be weak in his eyes;
But, ere blind he entirely goes,
Think with what grace he bedecks his odd face,
With a bran span new famous false Nose.
He looks like a Don; puts bis spectacles on,
And his head up he tosses and throws ;
His mind to amuse, reads over the news,
While all folks admire his astonishing N ose ;
He smiles at each scoff, takes his spectacles off,
Not heeding the Ahs nor the Ohs,
But firmly does stand, puts up his right-hand,
And silently pockets his Nose.
Toll loll, &c.
