IS the above propoSal .Should meet with the general approbation of
both the PROPRIETORS and SUBSCRIBERS Mr Cawdell is willing to reduce it to practice immediately; if not, he will continue his Nights of

honour of a Name as ufual from Such oS the Nobility, Ladies, or Gentlemen as may be inclined to do him that Savour, on either cS tlioSe

Among the interesting incidents with which this Piece abounds, is the arrival of the
Travellers at the Cottage of Bapfista, who, in league with a desperate band headed by
his sous, makes several attempts to accomplish the
A rJf'

Murder of Raymond,
who is however, informed of his danger by Marguerette, by means of a blood-stained pillow,
with which she furnishes his bed, and is by her prevented from swattowinga sleeping potion
mixed in his drink by Baptista, wliom he overcomes at the moment he is about to perpetrate the murdcrwI Agnes, and assisted by Marguerette,

ACCOMPLISHES

HIS

DEATH

By mean*, of a concealed paunel, leadingto a lonepath through the forest, they, .accompanied by Marguerette, escape the Banditti, and arrive safe at the Castle of Lindetiberg.
At length Raymond, amongst a train of adventures in his pursuit of Agnes, encounters

The Spectre

Nun,

wbom ho discovers to be the Mother of Agnes.' and to whose spirit he swears from that moment to project her offspring. H e afterwards fulfils his oath by rescuing her from the cave
of the Robbers, whom having succeeded in overcoming,

THE SHADR OF THE MURDERED AGNES,
being appeased, ascends amidst the clouds, blessing the Union of her Child with her Deliver; winch terminates the Drama ; forming a striking and interesting conclusion.

Zeyn Is discovered, pensively seated on a couch—he reclines—the place grows dar
and Asdrael, the King of the Genii, in a brilliant cloud, appears and speaks—Music—the
Genii disappears—Zeyn rises, looks round, doubts his being awake—sees a ring, pulls i$,

This Piece is founded on the following Fact, as related by the
-brated French Author St. FOIX.
AUBRl DE M O . L
At
*"• w a s manlered and buried under a tree.
Hi*dog would not quit his niaf
„;.ied by hunger, he went to the house
of an intimate friend of the unib...,.
At.
. y howling, seemed desirous of expressing
the loss they had both sustained. He related his cii.s, iau 10 tl.t ~..or, then looked back to see whether any body
followed him, returned to his master's friend, pulled him by the sleeve, and with dumb eloquence, intreated him to go
with him. The singularity of all the actions of the faithful animal, his coming there without his master, whose
constant companion he had alwavs been; the sudden disappearance of AuBRi, and perhaps that divine dispensation
of events, which will not permit the guilty to remain long undetected,—all (and seveial) these circumstances induced
the company to follow the d.g, who conducted them to the fatal tree where he renewed his howl, scratching the
earth with his feet, to signify that this was the spot where they ought to search. Accordingly on digging, the body
.f the unfortunate A UBR I was discovered."

This. piece is founded on the J following fact, as related by the celebrated
Kq
: Author, XL FOIX.

French

" AUBRI D^tjMONDIDIER, travelling alone through the Forest of Bondy, was murdered, and buryed under
a tree. His dog would not quit his master's grave for several days, till at length, compelled by hunger, he went to
the houseWf an intimate Friend of the unftyrtumte AUBRI, at Paris, and by his melancholy howling, seemed desirous
a of, expresijiig-the loss t .ley had both sustained. • He repeated his cries, ran to the door, then looked back to see
whether any body followed him, returned to his master's friend, pulled him by the sleye, and with dumb eloquence
in treated him to go with him. The singularity of all the actions of the faithful animal, his coming there without
his master, whose constant companion he had always been; the sudden disappearance of ACBRI, and perhaps that
divine dispensation of events, which will not permit the guilty to remain long undetected,—all (and several) these
circumstances induced the company to follow the dog, who conducted them to the fatal tree, where he renewed
his howl, scratching the earth with his feet, to sijgnifj that this was the spot where they ought to search. Accordingly on digging, the body of the unfortunate ACBRI was discovered."
