“'The event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by Dr. Darwin’, and some of the physiological ■writers of Germany, as not of impossible occurrence.—I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors. The event on which the interest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment; it was recommended by the novelty of he situation which it developes; aud, however impossible as a physical fact, affords a point of view to theimagi-, ation, for the delineating of the human passions, more comprehensive and commanding than any which the ordinary relations of existing events can yield.”	From the Preface to the Novel of Frankenstein.
The striking moral exhibited in this story, is the fatal consequence of thut presumption which attempts 'So penetrate, bey aud prescribed depths, into the mysteries of nature.
