Mr. William G. Ellis ton begs leave to state that his Father, Mr. Elliston, in the situation in which he at present stands with respect to the Theatre, has determined not to take a Benefit. Having, in the course of the season, and during the illness of his Father, been entrusted with a considerable share in the management, Mr. William G. Elliston takes the liberty of announcing that, at the suggestion of several of his friends, he has decided to venture upon a Benefit, on his own account. This Benefit will take place at the Theatre Royal, Drury-Lane, on Thursday, the 22nd Instantand, in the peculiar circumstances in which he is placed, Mr. William G. Elliston trusts it will not be deempd presumptuous in him to express a hope, that the liberal patronage with which his Father has, on so many occasions, been honoured, and in the endeavour to deserve which his whole properly has been sacrificed, will, in some degree, be extended to his Son and R epresentati vc, at a moment when it cannot fail to be of so much value to him, and to those connected with him.
Due intimation wili be given of the performances, iu which the strength of the Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden Companies will be combined; and, in the meantime, Tickets may be had and Places taken-, of Mr. Spring, at the Box-Office in the Theatre, and of Mr. W. G. Elliston, at No. 9, Stratford-IMace.
