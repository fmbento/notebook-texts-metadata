Description of the Pantomime
A.CT

I.

The celebrated Spectacle, founded on the Adventures of the French Navigator of ihat nainc, was
translated and adapted to the English Stage by John Fawcett, \M\. Map' Manager of Covrnt
Harden Theatre. 1805, where its success was almost beyond precedent, ami vheie its attraction as ;i
tavounte with the Public still continues undiminished, whenever it is repeated.—The Piece opens with

A Tempestuous Sea and Shipwreck,
Perouse is seen Swimming from the wreck, nearly exhausted—Reaches the Island—and is struck
with honor at iis desolation—He finds a large Chest washed on shore from the wreck—Lights a flw
near the Rocks, and discovers a Cave, which he endeavours to explore, and on his return is alarmed
by the appearance of a Bear, and an animal resembling

A LARGE

MONKEY,

•

Which the Bear is on the point of Destroying, when Perouse fires and kills him, Champanzee, by
various contortions, shews his gratitude to his Preserver, and leads him in search of water. Perou?e
is astonished at the appearance of a large Body of Savages at repast, who instantly rush upon him
with intent to destroy him, but are prevented by the interposition of Umba, a female Savage, who
seems interested by his appearance, and effects a Reconciliation.—Umba's love for Perouse excite*
the Jealousy of Kanko.

II.

In the front of the Stage is erected a Pile of Stpnes, on which is inscribed conspicuously, " On
(his desolate Island,' La Perouse was the only one saved from the Wreck, in January, 1797, remaining in the company of a female Savage the following Years—1197, 1798, 1800. If any civilized
Navigator should see this, let him enter the Cave that bears Perouse's Name, and he may know his
Fate." Madame Perouse arrives on the Island, accompanied by her Son and Congee, in search of
her Husband—She discovers the entrance of the Cave, on which is registered the Arrival aud Residence of Perouse.

The Grotto of Perouse.

Kanko and the Savages attempt to Assassinate the whole Family in fheir Sleep, but are prevented
by the sagacity of Champanzee—They, however, carry off Madame Perouse. Her Husband, in a .
attempt to regain ber, is taken Prisoner by the Savages—They are led to a Pile, and about to be
burnt, when a party of Sailors from the Ship, are brought to the soot by Champanzee, who overpower
the Savages, and the Family are restored to each other. To conclude with a Picture, expressive
of GRATITUDE AND DELIVERANCE.

THEATRE-ROYAL, HULL.
On FRIDAY, January 12th, 1827,
Hi* Maj.ttvi • • r t a u U will perform (for the first time t h e i . Sevan Tear.) Mnturin'« «*l«br*t»d
Tragedy o f

BERTRAM,
Or, the Castle of St. Aldobrand.
A Drama, which for Sentiment and brilliant Imagery, it acknowledged to be the firil of o a r
Hiatrionic Productions. I t is seldom we behold a Composition, combining the sublimity of
Poetical Simile with the Action and Situation of Stage Effect; and, therefore, when we meet
with the Tragedy of Bertram, breathing the pure Soul of Poesy, mingled with t bat of the Business of the Stage, it must be esteemed a Gem among the numerous Class of Dr»matic Produetiona;
not only are the Incidents and Situations striking and romantic, but they are supported with a
F o r e , and Talent equiil to their conception. Maturin was a Poet, who delighted to soar in t b .
Begiont of Fancy and Feeling—hearing the Peruser on in a stale of dazzling and feverish E n thusiasm; yet, in the height ol his romance, pure thrilling Pathos was his great and characteristic excellence; BE PAINTED FROM KATiiBK, putting to the blush, those who would deny l b .

Ere around the huge oak that overshadows yon Mill,
The fond ivy had dar'd to entwine,
E r e the church was a ruin that nods'on von hill
Or the rook built her nest in the pine.

L, Cou'd I trace back the time, to a far distant date,
|j>
W h e n my forefathers teil'd in this field ;
For the farm I now hold on your honour's estate
I s the same that my grandfather tjH"d.
He died, and beqweath'd to bis son a ffood name,
Which unsullied desended to me :
For my child I've preserved it unblemi?h'd from shame
And it still from a spot shall go free.

Our Theatre closed on Friday evening with
The y/j/i:t(j Dutchman, and ' 2 w a s I.
The House was only
tolerably attended. At theconchisionofthe JPlay, Mr. P o w u e ,
the Manager, came forward, and spoke nearly to the following
effect:—
" Ladies and Gentlemen—Permit rae to offer my most sincere
thanks to those patrons and friends,--who have honoured the Theatre by their support during the past season ; ami suffer me to assure
you, that it", under any circumstances, I Lail in giving that satisfaction
to the public which is at all timed my earnest desire, the error
must arise from want of judgment, or some untoward occurrence
over which I have no cuutroui;—it never can have for its origin a
diminution of my intense anxiety to provide for the amusement
and gratify the taste of my patrons* If the production of every
novelty worthy of representation—the engagement of such performers as come within my means, and are best qualified to support
the respectability of the establishment—have any claims to your
attention, I shall confidently rest on the hope of eventually obtaining your approbation
For the distinguished patronage
which marked the night appropriated exclusively to my own benefit,
I beg to offer my warmest thanks. For the orphan, children,
whose interests are associated with mine, and for the performers
generally, I would also make every grateful acknowledgment; and
ferventlIjirishiiig that you may enjoy all happiness and prosperity
uutil we have agaia tbIhofiQur of appearing before you, I most
respectfully l»id you farewell."
We 'infer from the ajjbve- address, as well as from all we have
heard, ticat the last season has been less successful than usual—
a result, we have reason to believe, principally attributable to
the company itself. Though including some highly respectable performers, besides several who give promise of improvement, it has not been, as a whole, worthy of the Hull Theatre ;
and instead of atoning for this deficiency, by a combination
of effort, some of the actors, who had incurred dismission
or quarrelled with their associates, endeavoured to form parties
against the Manager and each other, whose senseless opposition, on several .occasions, interrupted the entertainments,
rendered the Theatre a scene of tumult rather than amusement,
and deterred many of the admirers of the Stage from lending it
their supjjort.
If the Manager, as we believe, is desirous
to "gratify the taste of his patrons," he must provide greater
talent, particularly in the vocal department, and must also i n troduce a stricter system of discipline among the members of
his establishment.
T h e following is a pretty correct statement of the sums received at the benefits of those connected
with the company:
