SPECULATION •
Or, T H E BOY FOR IT.
BY BILLY O'ROURKE.
Tune.—-" Billy O'Roltr&e."
.

SOME are always venturing,
Others venture none at all.
Some in luck so centering.
When they v&nture get it a l l ;
Some have nor credit nor cash.
Others have both, and employ for it ;
But among.Speculators to dash.
Sure T O M M Y B I S H is the boy for it.
Whoop fal lal de ral, &c.
Some are dabsters at Stock-Jobbing,
Never stand shilly-shally, too ;
At all in the ring, without Stock-Jobbing-,
Some waddle out of the Alley too,
W h e n people lose, laughter mocks ;
When people win, they have joy for i t ;
If you'd be into the STOCKS,
Sure T O M M Y B I S H is the boy for it.
Whoop, &c.
Some for a slice of the Loan put in,
Truth and their "reason are not a w r y ;
S®me for another guess bone put in,
And pickings get out of the Lottery.
If you'd with good-luck be well,
A Ticket's a pretty good toy for i t ;
If you ask who the Prizes can sell,
Sure T O M M Y B I S I I is the boy for it.
Whoop, &c.
Of all the days in Time's round-about,
For innocent pastime enjoying, G !
V A L E N T I N E ' S best will be found about.
For then is the Lottery Drawing, G !
If Fortune to woo you incline.
And she shouldn't turn out too eoy for it.
To get her for your Valentine,
Sure T O M MY BISII is the boy for it.

An ADDRESS,
Inchtdwg a NEIF"PLAN for changing; the Order of Dramatick Performance*
at this Theatre;

Delivered by Mr. HARTLEY to the Audience,
On Saturday, Sep. 20, 1817.
Ladies and Gentleman,
T H E depressed slate of all Theatrical Property, and the obvious decline of Publick interest ife
the once favorit< Amusements of the Drama, are increasing evils which have been ascribed by various
conjectures to various causes. T o comment, generally, upon these would, in this place, be impertinent;
but amongst others, a large portion of die Publick have advanced, that the early hour of commencing the
performances renders it impossible to attend an amusement which interferes with the late hours of
dinner, or tire protracted hours of business; and a no less considerable body of the community have
com[il',ined. that I he late hours to which the representations of the Stage are extended, mater.al.-f
itjff&i -c the ordinary habits of life to which they are accustomed. All parties, however, have
..ten- in condemning, as with oue voice, the length of Theatrical performnnces, in which the attention.
of th auditor, can rarely be kept alive during a period ot, at least, live hours; and never without
fe.tigi.p both of body and mind.
In some degree to remedy the evil complained of by those whose habits of life or avocations
would not p.rmit their early attendance at Theatres, the custom of taking Half-Price was introduced.
But i< mufti be obvious to every one, that this plan has been found incompetent to its object. Many
"*ersoi.c who -vodd be desirous to witness the early part of a performance, are indi«posed to pay the
price of i whole evening's entertainment for that portion of it only which they can enjoy: and it may
reasonahi". b^ Buppnsed, that thousands who might wish to enter a Theatre at a later hour, (as at the
usual time of secoi'd price,] arc wholly excluded by the certainty of finding the best seata occupied.
Thus, number!--.* persons, from the one or the other cause, are deterred from frequenting the
amusements of the .Stage.
Long experience and much reflection on these contending difficulties, havp suggested to the
P-oprietor of tins Theatre a mode of reconciling them. It is obvious, that to accommodate one principal cla<=s of the patrons of Theatres, the performances must commence at an early hour; and to
gratify another, no less important class, they must be continued to a late one: and as the Man of
Leisure cannot be induced to forego his present habits ot dining at the old English stipper-tiwzr; and
astir Man of Business, rind other persons of early Slid domestic!*: pursuits, cannot be pre>-tiled op a
to?ibrid£e their hours of sleep in order to cptpp.-t.Bent with their company the perform":- e of a midTI'~
' o-Dra;ua; it IS become necessary, to the interests (if not the very existent !) of fheaitrts,
:
th't
roeasdr
. be adopted to meet the wishes and tastes of both cla-.-e. on ffhom [hi
pcc>K
• immediately depends
...s view, it is proposed, as an Experiment for the few remaining nights of this s _
try
Ian (so novel to a regular Theatre} of dividing every evening's entertainment into I'wo
ti-c 'arts or Performances. Each performance to consist of a full three-act Opera ; OR, of a short
Opera, with a Ballet, or a Musical Entertainment

T H E F I R S T PERFORMANCE
(The Doors to open at half-past Five.)
To begin at SIX o'CLOCK precisely, and to last till about N I N E .

Although, as the entertainments of Theatres have encreased in tengih, it has never been proposed, on that account, to encrease the prices of Admission.—Yet, now that it is intended to limit their
duration, it is respectfullv and cheerfully proposed, that the following reduction shall take place.

THE PRICES

OF

ADMISSION

To either Performancr, will be—BOXES 3s.—PIT 2$ —GAL. Is.—Up. GAL. 6d.
Boxes and places will be taken for either perfi nuance ; and the Grand Saloon, with its admired
decorations, will be appropriated, by a new arrangement, to the use of the company visiting the Boxes
at the second performance, and as a promenade for the comptnv to wait for their carriages, on leaving
the boxes at the conclusion of the early entertainments.
W e are fullv aware that we shall have to encounter many professional jokes upon this occasion;
and -we believe it' is pretty well known, that we have had every thing to struggle against from rival
Theatres, that ingenious opposition could devise We do not quarrel with opposition; because it is
quite natural that every man should think first of himself; and study his own interest in preference
to the interests of another; but we are alike prepared to smile at the good humoured raillery of our
iriends, and the hostile attempts of our enemies; who may both, perhaps, be inclined, in different
spirits, to call this " a Bartholemew Fair Scheme."—Let them call tt what they will'—we know that
our sole aim is to exist by your favour, and by devising all means for your entertainment, till we
ultimately receive an honest reward for our labours
This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the New Plan which I have the honour to submit to your con.
siueration. It is* another effort on the part of the Proprietor to promote the convenience and accommodation of t{ie PubUck; an object which he has never for a moment lost sighted', *inc« he fust
engaged in your service; and, in which he has thus far so proudly succeeded, that he ha- had to boast
an ample share of favour and protection, so far as favour and protection depended on the pnblick.
fateful, therefore, for your patronage, ho trusts this New Plan will be n n s t i o t e d . at a new
endeavour to deserve it. "

An ADDRESS,
Including a JSTEW PLAN for eftansrittsr the Order »fDramatick Performance*
at this Theatre;

Delivered by Mr. BARTLEY to the Audience,
* o« Sufarday, Sep. 20, 1817.
Ladles and Gentlemen,
T H E depressed state «>f all Theatrical Pr >pertv, and tire obvious decline of Pubiick interest in
the once favorit<- Amusements of the Drama, are increasing evils which have been ascribed by varie-seonjectnres to various causes. Tocomiiient. generally, upon these would, in this*place, be impertrner.?;
but amongst others, a large portion of the Pubiick have advanced, that 'be early hour of commencing fh-:
performances renders it impossible to attend an amusement which interfere, with the late hours of
dinner, or tlie protracted hours of business.; and a no leas considerable body of the cornmiwrify baTf
cornplained, that the late hours to which the representations of the Stage are extended... materrai
.leraivge the ordinary habits of life to which they are accustomed. Al! parties, however, have
agreed in condemning, as with one voice, the length of Theatrical performances-, in which tt»e atten; »i
of the auditors can rarely be kept alive during a period o), at least, five hours; and never w.*w- t
fatigue both of body and mind.
In some degree to remedy the evil complained of by those whose habits of life or avocation*
would not permit their early attendance at Theatres, the custom of taking Half-Price was inlrod.ni- ,
But it must be obvious to every one, that this plan has been found incompetent to its object. Mntsy
persons who would be desirous to witness the early part of a performance, are indisposed to pay tb
price of a whole evening's entertainment for that portion of it only which fhey can enjoy : and it m - r
reasonably be supposed, tlrat thousands who might wish to enter a Theatre at a later boar, {an a the
usual time of second price,) are wholly excluded by the certainty of finding the best seats .Kcwpttd
Thus, numberless pen-ons, from the one or the other cause, are deterred from frequenting toe
amusements of tbe Stage.
Long experience and much refection €m these contending JifBcatiies, have .suggested to ute
Proprietor of this Theatre a mode of reconciling them It » obvious, that to accommodate one prmcipal class of the patrons of Theatres, UK- performances must commence st an early h o u r ; ar cl to
gratify another, no less important class, they must be continued to a late one r and as the Man of
Leisure cannot be induced to forego his present habits ot dining at the old English supper-time;
as the Man of Business, and other persons of early and doroestick pursuits, ca-.no. W prevailed spon
to abridge their hours of steep in order to compliment witb their company the performance © f a n <1«
night Melo-Drama; it is become necessary, to the interests (if not the very existence) of 1 beafrt-,
that some measure should be adopted to meet the wishes and tastes of both e l a t e s , on wboeu tu
prosperity so immediately depends.
With this view, it is proposed, as an Experiment for the few remaining nights of this season, to
try the Plait (so novel to a regular Theatre) of dividing every evening's entertainment into Two distinct Parts or Performances. Each performance to consist of a full three-act Opera ; OK, of a shoe;
Cpera, with a Ballet, or a Musical Entertainment.

T H E F I R S T PERFORMANCE
(TJie Doors to open at half-past
Five.)
T o begin at SIX O'CLOCK precisely, and to last till about N I N E .

T H E SECOND PERFORMANCE
T o begin at half-past N I N E , and to conclude at T W E L V E .
Although, as the entertainments of Theatres have encreased bt lengthr it has never been purposed, on that account, to encreasethe prices of Admission.—Yet. now that it is intended to limit their
.Juration, it is respectfully and cheerfully proposed, that the following reduction shall take place.

W e are fully aware that we shall have to encounter many professional jokes upon this occasionJMid we believe it is pretty well known, that we have bad every thing to struggle against from rival

WfHiLE the Patentees of the W I N T E R Theatres incessantly
Complain of the encroachments of other Theatres; and appeal
by Petitions
against those that open under the Lord
Chamberlain's Licences and by Prosecutions against those
that act under the Licences of the Magistrates, it is time that
the attention of the Legislature, and of the Publick, should be
called to the gradual encroachments made by these great
establishments on their more limited and more defenceless
neighbours. I n GarricKs time, the winter Theatres played
never more than 150 or 100 Nights in the year; till within
the last ten years, they never exceeded an average of 2 0 0
Nights; opening in the middle of September, and closing
early in June.
They have now gradually extended their
, performances from the beginning of September to towards
the end of July, leaving only an interval of six or seven weeks,
when the Town is comparatively empty, (and in the dog-days)
for the summer Theatres to reap their little scanty harvest.
The Theatre Royal Drury Lane has now re-opened in the
middle of August, leaving the .summer Theatres
twenty-one
Nights only, free from an oppressive eovetousness, which it
appears can only be bounded by the ruin of more humble rivals.
The attention of the Publick is now respectfully called to
this brief statement; and their continued patronage earnestly
solicited to the Theatre Royal English Opera House, in which
the most animated exertions will continue to be made to merit
their favour.

The WINTER Theatres.
the Patentees of the W I N T E R Theatres incessantly
complain of the encroachments of other Theatres;
and appeal
by Petitions
against those that open under the Lord
Chamberlain's Licences and by Prosecutions against those
that act under the Licences of the Magistrates, it is time that
the attention of the Legislature, and of the Public-k, should be
called to the gradual encroachments made by these great
establishments on their more limited and more defenceless
neighbours. I n Garriclis time, the winter Theatres played
never more than 1 5 0 or 1 6 0 Nights in the year; till within
the last ten years, they never exceeded an average of 2 0 0
Nights; opening in the middle of September, and closing.
early in June. They have nowr gradually extended their
performances from the beginning of September to towards
the end of July, leaving only an interval of six or seven weeks,
when the Town is comparatively empty, {and in the dog-days)
for the summer Theatres to reap their little scanty harvest.
T h e Theatre Royal Drury Lane has now re-opened iii the
middle of August, leaving the summer Theatres twenty-one
Nights only, free from an oppressive covetousness, which it
appears can only be bounded by the ruin of more humble rivals.
SINCE

The attention of the Publick is now respectfully called to
this brief statement; and their continued patronage earnestly
solicited to the Theatre Royal English Opera House, in which
the most animated exertions will continue to be made to merit
their favour.

The WINTER Theatres.
the Patentees of the W I N T E R Theatres incessantly
complain of the encroachments of other Theatres;
and appeal
by Petitions
against those that open under t h e Lord
Chamberlains Licences and by Prosecutions against those
that act under the Licences of the Magistrates, it is time that
the attention of the Legislature, and of the Pub lick, should be
called to the gradual encroachments made by these great
establishments on their more limited and more defenceless
neighbours.
I n Garrich's time, the winter Theatres played never more
than 1 5 0 or 1 6 0 Nights in the year; till within the last ten
years, they never exceeded an average of 2 0 0 Nights; opening
in the middle of September, and closing early in J u n e . They
have, now gradually extended their performances from th/
beginning of September to towards the end of July, leaving
only an interval of six or seven weeks, when the Town is
comparatively empty, (and in the dog-days) for the summer
Theatres to reap their little scanty harvest.
The Theatre Royal Drury Lane has now re-opened in the
middle of August, leaving the summer Theatres twenty-one
Nights only, free from an oppressive covetousness, which it
appears can only be bounded by the ruin of more humble rivals.
SINCE

The attention of the Pnblick is now respectfully called to this brief
statement; and their continued patronage earnestly solicited to the Theatre
Royal English Opera House, in which the most animated exertions will
continue to be made to merit their favour.
The following is the convincing answer of the Lessee of Drury Lane Theatre
to the above statement. The Proprietor of the English Opera House is anxious
to afford it publicity.

" This Theatre overflows every

Night"'

" The Patentees cannot condescend to enter into a competition of scurrility, which is only fitted for Minor
Theatres
—what their powers really are, will be, without any public
appeal, legally decided in November next, and any gasconade
can only be supposed to be caused by cunning or poverty." *
See Drury Lane Play-Bill,

August 18, 1820.

* Note.—The Publick will judge to whom the charge of "scurrility"
attaches.
As to "competition" in the practice of it, there can be none,—for the Proprietor of the English Opera House at once yields the palm (after the foregoing
specimen) to the Lessee of the Major Theatre.

Who having failed in his BENEFIT at t h e SURREY T H E A T R E , thiough t h e unfortunate wetness of the night, and general inclemency of
the Season, is again induced to solicit the Patronage of his Surrej and other friends 6n the present occasion.—And he has further the

justly celebrated

WFJSS

CLARA F I S H E R
they have most kindly tendered him the assistance of this universally acknowledged

Phenomenon

Theatric

of the Jlge !

This young Lady made her first appearance at the Theatre Royal, Dairy L a n e , December 10th, 1817. then just Six Years old, in
Garrick's revived Romance of L I L U P U T , in which was introduced the last act of KING RICHARD T H E T H I R D , and by h e r
surprising performance of the crook'd-back'd Tyrant, drew crowded houses for seventeen nights, and immediately afterwards, played
the same character at Covent Garden, with equal applause and success.
T h e T I M E S Paper of December 22nd, has the following quaint but elegant compliment to her." A f t e r the excellent Corned/
of J o h n Bull, Lilliput followed, and the acting of the Child, Miss C L A R A FISHER, may be considered as the most extraordinary intellectual Phenomenon that ever puzzled a metaphysician."
In which praise and opinion, every Paper and Publication of the day,
warmly concurred. She has since appeared in Edinburgh, Bath, Y o r k , and every respectable Theatre in the kingdom, with the most
decided applause and approbation—and will, for THIS N I G H T O N L Y , appear in THREE of her PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS,
previous to h e r return to fulfil her third engagement in the North.
