In presenting this Doleful Tragedy for the first time on the Stage of
uny Theatre, it is believed that a few particulars relative to its literary
history will neither prove unimportant, or uninteresting. The play
itself, which has been recently discovered amongst the papers of a retired
Cheesemonger, belongs apparently to the Elizabethan period, a supposition rendered more probable by a Latin inscription on thefly-leafwhich,
though nearly obliterated by time, may be decyphered thus: —" Men!
of Rettl Martini."
signifying doubtless the names of the joint
Authors as "Myself and Elizabeth Martin;" names which though not
familiar, perhaps, to the students of our early dramatic history, are yet
of no rare occurrence in popular literature. As the most indefatigable
researches in the British Museum have failed to bring to light any quarto
Orfolioedition of * Ye Tragioalle Hystorie of WilSifcind and uis Dinah,
with ye manner of theyre love-makynge, ye Cruelle Parient's enmitie,
and theyre most pittiful ends," there is reason to believe that it wa
never printed, and, consequentlv, it is fair to assume, that it was never
published. The original story on which the plot was based seems equally
to have baffled the investigation of those who sought to trace the legend
to its primitive source. An anonymous writer in a work dated 1583, and

entitled "A Paradise of Curious Conceits and
D a i n t i o D e v i c e s * ' ' alludes to a similar story in which a Parent
refuses consent to a Daughter's Marriage. The name of Williklnd, however, seems unknown in the Parish Registers before 1602, when it figures
in an entry, which would seem to show that a person of that name then
existed, but whether it was the same individual-- there is now no possible
method of ascertaining. Dinah, or Dian-ah - the interjection "ah!" having
been palpably appended to the first syllable to express the melancholy
nature of her career,—has been often made the subject of reference by
the lyrists of Ethiopia, but there is no reason for supposing that they
eould throw any light on the Present history. Under these circum.
stances, as it would appear that no information oan be gained by pursuing the inquiry any further it seems to be most advisable to desist
from the attempt, and* the curious in these etymological, genealogical,
and archaeological researches are, therefore, confidently referred to the
Tragedy itself, which will be found to embraoe all the particular, hitherto

OF PANTOMIME

HARLEQUIN AND COLUMBINE A T BOMB,

O F

The ttasp being rejected by the fair
Butterfly,
lady Silreruings,
who is i n lore and betrothed
to the
Grate/topper
waits upon Belladonna,
the poison witch, to obtain a deadly poison,
u herewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends,
whom she has invited to a Ball and Feast given by her and the Grasshopper
in honor of their approaching
nuptials.
Belladonna
supplies
him with the poison ; but the buse plot is overheard
by Briqhttay,
the Genius of Spring
and friend of
the Butterflies,
who tells them she will do all in her power to baffle the foul design.
Ihighlray
repairs to the Butterfly I
Haunt, where
the promises
protection
to Sitventings,
saves the Butterflies
from the efforts of Matter Robert and his earnportions
to catch them, and gives permission
to Sihei wings to meet her lover, the Grasshopper,
at thtir trysting
place.
Her*
the lovers are interrupted
by tlie maliee of their enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The Wasp, on his way to the least, to which he has been invited,
looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings,
hoping to find an opportunity
of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banouet:
but the cooks seeing a Wasp
upon the premises,
make
desperate
efforts to catch him, but in tain.
After a severe chase the Wasp
escapes, out in the
encounter
breaks his bottle of poison.
The trumpeter,
Gadfly, calls all the guests to lite Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and Insects and Animals
proceed in procession
to the grass-green
lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels
take
plaot.
The discomfited
Wasp joins the festivities
with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst of
their mirth.
Belladonna
appears,
and demands of the Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of hts
bottle ; when the Witch immediately
changes the beautiful
summer landscape
into a winter one, with leafless trees,
frosen
rivers, and falling
snow.
All the party become torpid and dead with cold ; but the good friend
of th* Butterflies,
the Genius
of Spring,
appears,
and with her warm
rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against
the spite of their
enemies,
changes
the Grasshopper
into Harlequin,
and the Butterfly
into Columbine.
The Witch sends the Wasp and th»
Spider in pursuit of them, as Clown and Pantaloon I when, after many escapes and trials, the Butterfly and the
Grasshopper
are united, and live happy ever
after.

The trumpeter. Gadfly, calls all the guests to the Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the FUts and Insects and Animals proceed in ptoccssion to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place.
The discomfited Wasp joins the festivities with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin i when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demand* of the Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who telle her of the fate of Aw
bottle ; when the Wiich immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leafiest trees, frozen
rivers, and falling snow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold ; but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Genius
of &pring~appears,
and with her warm rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against she spite of their
enemies, changes the Grasshopper into Harleguia, and the Butterfly into Columbia:
The Witch sends the Wasp and the
Spider in pursuit of them, as Clown and Pantaloon { ichen,after many escapes and trials, thi Butterfly and the Grasshopper
are united, and live happy ever after.

Royal Lyceum Theatre
Tuesday, December 2SthAS52.
MR.

CHARLES MATHEWS
Presents his compliments to the Friends and Patrons of the Lyceum, and for the aurasemeirf
of those few among them who take an interest in such matters, begs to offer the following
specimen of the diurnal criticism of a respectable Journal in the Wth century.
It is scarcely necessary to state, that the

MORNING CHRONICLE
(From which paper it is extracted) has been deprived of its privileg. of writing two orders
Rightly to the Theatre > in consequence of previous equally illiberal attacks) but it IS necessarv to
acquaint thefriends(if any) of

Sir ANGUS REACH
(as that gentleman has chosen to throw off the character of anonymous enemy, and to stand fort
the avowed writer of the calumnies which excluded the paper from its usual privilege) that they
must seek the society of that talented Critic in some other Theatre, strict injunctions having
been given to the door keepers of the Lyceum to be vigilant, lest they should inadvertently receive
Ms money (an event, however, not to be feared) and thereby run the risk of admitting a declared
enemy, where it is hoped there may bo found none but friends,
EXTRACT FROM THE MORNING CHRONICLE of December 23th.
"LYCEUM:"
.

** The novelty offered to the holiday audience at this "house consisted oi The ihmd Wcmitm in Die Wend, a f ah y pic i In two acts,
Ciiraili d on Mademoiselle L A FORCE'S tide, by the author of the Golden Branch and the frland of Jcueh.

Knt.-rt.i'n mi ni

this nature have long been so hackneyed that they have ceased to Mouse the public, and tin story being in it• 111 II it i
devoid of any striking or all™ live features. Ilie pit o i !I coldly olid heavily on the ear of the spi <t ttore.

of

• i . md

The ejrcc lb nt ai ting

of Mr. F. M.mitKWi, in the stock extiavagaiura character of a.fiery-fared tyrant, probably alone saved it from a (b • i :vc rnnib inn it ton.

With regard to the songs, the mo-t noticeable w»s one of which the point consisti d in Miss.Jrt.ia ST. Gi:o*<ituavi g

" 0 4 ' inollii r," and Madame V.STRia replying, " Oh ! bother ;" and of the dancing it may be sufficient to remark that it was in
the style peculiar tothe theatre.

Much has been said of the expense lavished on the scenery of holiday pieces at this house, awl

the can and i lrganrr with which all the accessories are got up j yet a very tame attempt was made to make the same scene do
duty twice o v e r - o n c e in the first act, as the view of the banks of Lake Lucid, and again in the second act, as the magic forest at
the boundary of Bloomland.

The management will hardly find its account in such a style of doing matters ; but the tr.il » is

,nite in character with the failed and dingy look of some of the other views, which secmt d designed to predu. e an impri ssion.
There wen. bi side., two other pieces—the Phenmiu nan m the Stanch l''rnc',, which is a mere compound of absurdity and dulness,
and l.ittk

TmlJhlini,

the very rickety progeny, we believe, of Mr. C. MATHBWS.

Mr CHARLES MATHEWS trusts that to those who have ROT seen the New
Extravaganza the name of

MrWILLI AM BEVERLY
will boa sufficient guarantee that this Is a gross libel upon the SCENERY ; while to
those who HAVE, the evidenoe of their own eyes will, he hopes, be sufficient.
For the success (allowing the extraordinary manifestation vt applause of a
first night—the calling before the curtain of all concerned- oven the Painter of the
"dingy views" alluded to—and the eulogies published by ALL the other leading
journals -to be not only fallacious, but absolutely indicative of decisive condemnation.") TIME has invariably been found to be a better Critic than even that of
the morning Chronicle; and with regard to the sweeping oensure passed upon
the pieces, the acting, the singing, the dancing, the getting up, tne elegance and
taste of "doing matters" generally at the Lyceum, Mr Charles Mathews is quite
content to throw himself upon his Friends and the Public at lame, and leave them
to judge whether, after the specimen of enlightened criticism here quoted, he has
not be^n more Mj^p justifled in depriving the Morning Chronicle of its 111 requited

privilege

The following letter, published three days subsequently, in the same paper, will shew the animus with watch
the previous notice was composed:
TO T H E E D I T O R O F T H E M O R N I X t . f l l l i O X I O L E .
Slit—Last night I was at the T.yecum, and rvm\ the vulgar and very silly pMcke by Mr Charles Mathews against your reporter.
I know nothing, and care nothing, as to the supposed personal quarr. 1 between these "cntlcmen : but 1 am hound to inform
you. in justice to your clitic, that in my humble opinion, his a i . m n t i f the p a Ibiniaeer, though it might perhaps have b e n
(.mouthed down a liltte, is neither illiberal nor unjust
Tlic extravaganza appeals to me one of the dullest and most vapid affairs
ever produced ou tlea.e boards, Ihe scenery mediocre and the actiag and singing far from equal Li the aver;, t' of London t'hrtsiinas pieces. The jokes were Hat, and I can positively deel„re lhat the audc-iice received the perbirmm-e with respectful silence.
Oni- pretty .scene, a lake view, d t s e n e s praise, hut beyond this 1 caniior t a < ord my approbation of Mr \1 .thews' extravaganza,
which us even he seems |o ^tu;lll st, depends principal!,- on the scene pain! a\ f o r my own Jiart I preler sec i t hri-tin is pieces as
the Keclcys used to fiivc us, tl tu/ting/nn, Ataklm, #•., to all t i c paint md gildim, of Mr. Mallirw-, iv'ien uasupporied by
huniour and good aiting.
'I'hi DC reui.ii ks \ feel obliged to forward to you after reading the managerial notes on the Lyceum plav lull ; but as I have no
wish to entrust Mr Mathews with my name. 1 beg to sign myself, in ease VflBi may pub'ish this note, \ o e ,,!i -dicnt s -rvani,

If not written by the same reporter this only proves that there are TWO persons connected with the Moruiag
Chronicle wholly regardless of the truth, instead of ONE.
.
It Will not appear surprising that Ihis stranger ' who knows nothing and rares notnintr," should teel so strotiga regard for the Burlesques siven l»y the Keeleys. as he (sonrewhat too ftanriiarly it may \>«. houyht toriso total a
itranger, calls them, when it is explained that Mr Koeley accepted a Faieo by Mr Antjiw R act and Mr Charles
Mathews refused one. The " ricketty bantling." (a translation from the French d'ed i its mf.mcy, while that of
Mr Cuarles Mathews is alive and hearty; and the 'ignorant and eiireless' FHlo-Dram-it ctt" will dmbtless be
pleased to hear that, spite of the attempt of the Morning Chronicle to tbt. angle it in its cradle, both " tdother
and Child aro doing well."

devoid of any sinking or attractive feature., the pieee felt coldly and heavily on the ear of the spectators. The excellent acting
of Mr. f. MUTIMFWH, in the itock extravaganza character of a hery-faced tyrant, probably alone saved it from a decisive condeuuiatioa. With regard to the ».ng«, the most n.ticeable was one "of which the point consisted in Miss ,Tut.tA St. GKOBOE saying
" Oh ' mother," and Madame V i t r e i , replying, " Oh! bother;" and of the dancing it may be sufficient to remark that it was in
the style peculiar to the theatre. Much has been said of the expense lavished on the scenery of holiday pieces at this house, and
the care and elegance withwhieh all the accessories are got up; yet a very lame attempt was made to make the same scene do
duty twice over—once in the first act, ts the view of the banks of Lake Lucid, and again in the second act, as tho magic, forwt X
the boundary of BUnmland. T h . management will hardly find its account in such a style of doing matters ; but this trait wa»
quite in character with the tad.l ».d dingy look of some .f the other vi*w*, which seemed designed to produce an impression,
'there were, besides, two other pieces—the Phenomenon. M» the Smoek jPtvpk, which is a mere compound of absurdity and dolus.*,
and Little Ttddltkins, the very rickety progeny, we believe, *f Mr, C MATHEWS.

Mr CHARLES HATHEWS trusts that to those who have NOT seen the Hew
Extravagatua the n a m . of

Mr WILLIAM BEVERLY

will be a sufficient guarantee that this Is a grots libel upon the SCENERY; while to
those who HAVE, the evidence of their own eyes will, he hopes, be sufficient.
For the success -1 allowing the extraordinary manifestation of applause of a first
night the calUn* before the ourtain of all concerned even the Painter of the "dingy
views" alluded to and the eulogies published by ALL the other daily «& weekly
Journals- to be not only fallacious, but absolutely indicative of "decisive condemnation.") TIME has invariably been found to be a better Critic than even that
of the Horning Chronicle 1 and with regard to the sweeping censure passed upon
the pieces, the acting, the singing, the dancing, the getting up, tne elegance and
taste of 'doing matters ' generally at the Lyceum, Mr Charles Mathews is auite
content to throw himself upon his Friends and the Public at large, and leave them
to judge whether,after the specimen of enlightened criticism here quoted, he has
not been more than justified in depriving the Morning Chronicle of its ill requited
privilege. ,
S a t u r d a y . J a n u a r y lit, 1851.

The following letter, Bahi>hed three d a y . subsequently, in the same paper, will shew the animus with which
the previous notice wan composed
TO THE EDITOR OP THE MORNING CHRONICLE.
PTR—Last night I Was at the Lyceum, and read the vulgar and very sillv tffirhe by Mr. Charles Mathews against your reporter.
I know nothing, and care nothing, as to the supposed personal nitarrel between these gentlemen; bat I am bound to inform
•yon, in jnatH e lei lour critic, that, in my humble opinion, his account of the performance, though it might perhaps hare been
uuoothed don n a little, is neither illiberal nor unjust. The extravaganza appears to me one of the dullest and most vapid affair.
1 ver produoed on those boards, the scenery mediocre, and the acting and singing far from equal ts the average of Lomlon Christ111:1s pieces. Tin jokes were Sat. and 1 can positively declare that the audience i•• reived the performance w%th respectful silence.
One prettyfeeene,a lake Tiew, deserve, praise, but beyond this I cannot record my approbation of Mr. Mathews' extravaganza,
u hii li ,i» even lie teems to suggest, depends principally on the scene {winter. For m v 0 ,rn part 1 prefer such Christmas pieces as
tin Keeleys used to give us, ifHUmglpn, AkJdm, tc, t» .11 the paiat and gilding of Mr. Mathews, when unsupported by
humour and good acting.
Tins.1 remarks I fee! obliged to forward t . yen after reading tht managerial notes on the Lyceum play bill; but as I have no
wish to entrust Mr Mathews with my name, I beg to sign myself, in case you may publish this note, vour obedient servant,
Dee. 31.
" PHILO-DRAMATICUS.
If not written by the same Mporter this only prove, that there are TWO persons connected with the Horning
Chronicle wholly regardless ef t h e truth, instead of OMR,
,, ,
I t will not appear surprising that this stranger •' who knows nothing and cares nothing," should teel so strong
a regard for the BurleMues i i v . n by the Keeleys, as he (somewhat too familiarly it may be thought for so total a
stranger, calls them, when i t to explained that Mr Keeley accepted a Farce by Mr Angus Reach, and Mr Charles
Mathews refused one. The " rick.rty bantling," (a translation from the French. died in its infancy, while that of
Mr Charles Mathews is alive a n d hearty; and t h e 'ignorant and careless' Philo-Dramatious will doubtless be
pleased to hear that, spite of t e e attempt of t h e Morning Chronicle to strangle it in i t . cradle, both "Mother
and Child arc doing welL"
At l e n g t h t h e E d i t o r W a n d s .oldly f o r t h .and i d e n t i t i e s himself w i t h t h e m a t t e r , i n t h e following t e r m . !->
E x t r a c t from t l w M O R N I N G C H R O N I C L E , Monday, J a n u a r y 3rd, 1853.
" On TutHi'av last Mr Chsrie* Math,*, psblished a nB.tk.b1. playbill, ntiacking The Morning Chronicle and its theatrical
cri.ie, v hich has had ih. natural result of Mnd.ting its author the laughing-stock of the week. Perfectly content with the pubiic
derision ev.kcd, we felt a natutsi beeitathm in tteopiag to make otn»*i**s merry either with the man or the thing ; but as it has
been an egested that only » few persona may be swat, ofth, full .bwadity of the exploit—nuy, that even Mt Charles Mathews himself moy be rrnotant of the actual brilliancy .this *wn achievement- wean far concede our prepossessions as to announce that the article
abused was not written by the wdfaduai whs was named, in type »» i n * long, in the Lyceum bill, as being its writer, but that it
• ptBiluatio.. of A pirfectlr ditrVwat paraon, and that the owns, sf the inch-type name knew no more about the sentiments it
. pressed than Mr Charles Mathews diJ himself, untilfeeread it Mat day printed in the paper. Ibis di-»l.,sure of the actual fact
of the ense w ill put thecrowning stroke, in nuWte estimation, to the Lyceum folly, while it will give an aocmate notion of the credibility
,.i the other facts alleged by Mr Charles Mathews.
,
.
" This vary flippant and cranky geatWs,a» seeBS, indeed, to think that a word uttered against hii majesty is t£e highest of
hi«h treason-—that everything he doss must at sacred—and that as soon a» a critic enters tho Lyceum doers he is to abandon
e.'i i .thing like private judgment, and dare t* indite nothing but puff, puff, puff, of the infallible Chstrfes Mathews and the in• fl ble Lycenaj. It it really quite miserable to see a roan of talent in his profession behaving like a .polled child, and kicking
anj sereatning at the wholesome pill administered with the best of mreiitioas. Can it be that Mr. Mathews w.mts nothing but
litcrarj lolipops—nothing but critical Godfrey's Cordial ? In that case let him write his own criticisms—every one knows that he
is a literary man—and let him give them daily to an astonished world, ts he does other striking productions of his pen, on an
.-rtra third side of his bills.
•
•• It is o^ite clear that either manager1! aiueiw. anst, b* adopted, or that criticism must be entirely independent of managcrir.1 whim. One or the ether, Mr. Charles Mathews. B . y»uw own critic—hire your own critic, if you please ; but so long a m
independent and impartial judge enters the Lyesuni, W long will its productions be independently and impartially treated.

O-r The 106th Edition of Professor ANDERSON'S "SHILLING'S WORTH O^MMIC" to be had
w
"it the BoE-Offlce and in the Theatre.
Professor ANDERSON begs respectfully to announce the positive termination of his magical Performances in
consequence of the great pteparalion for his Spectacle and Fantomime at Covent Garden Theatre.

From THE TIMES, Sept. 4th.
Long before the name- of foreign professors of legerdemain—the Houdins, the
H e r m a n s , the Doblers—where
known in this Metropolis, Mr. Anderson, popularly calicd
he " AViaard of the N o r t h , " had an established reputation. H e was, if we are not deceived,
he -first among the present generation who practised legerdemain in grand and brilliant
t y l e . There - . r e conjurors who engaged tavern-rooms, egp^S2j*))v in the suburbs, where
hey performed tricks with cards, and artfully contrived boiCes with" more or less skill, and
n some cases legerdemain was one of the features of a miscellaneous evening's entertainment. B u t Professor Anderson at once ereftttd « sensation by engaging a whole theatre
for the display of his tricks alone, and incre.i*mg the edict of his elaborate achievements by
the splendour of his apparatus.
I t is now ten years- since professor Anderson hist performed in London, and ns during
that interval several celebrated eonjt|traA .frmn Ir-ince at»4 Germain have siicccsRiTpIv
engaged the attention of the public. lb& l l W k a r d •>! tin N o r t h , " on returning to the scene
of his former glories, llM not unwisely deemed it inexpedient to place his sole trust in the
memory of his j.ast fame. Accordingly, for several days, not to say weeks, the streets of
London have been adorned with every possible form of placard, foretelling the re-appearance
of the " W i z a r d " at the Lyceum, on Monday, the 3rd of September. In one place there
has been a simple announcement, in another a series of woodcuts representing the principal
tricks, and in some of the shop-windows a fine lithographic portrait of the Professor, that
would have passed very well for Sir John ttervcbrll or Sir David Brewster, to all who had
no personal knowledge of those gentlemen ; fur it was surrounded not by the implements ot
legerdemain, but by the instruments appertaining to real natural science. Hostile dcciar,.
turns, professing to come from the " Sutra rappers," -, 8 o appeared on the walls, repudiating
all connexion with the " Wizard." who it seemed was about to expose the mysteries of
modern sunernaturalii.il., snd declaring that " Spirit-rapping " should go on in spite of all
his revelations.
From all this it was evident that a l u n n n might be expected last night, and certainly,
when the hour for the commencement of the Professor's performance at the Lyceum was at
liatid, the e x c i l t n u n t ffH extiaordmary. The Boxes and Stalls vu-rc at once filled with a
fashionable audience, and the I'll bnrricuii* w e n f e c - d in, s . that lh- patrons, of this j...rt
of the house, incenvenieneed by the struggle, began their evening in a somewhat sulky
mood, and «»*•.. threatened a tumult when Mr. Anderson made his appearance.
However
after a few words of conversation between the Professor and a ringleader of the malcontent*;!

all angry feeling subsided, -Mid u<
an entertainment of the sort pass off with i
perfect good humour.
We arc not going to enter into * description of the Professor's tricks, which are of the
most elaborate and complicated kind, every one of them being, as it were, a nest comprising
half-a-dozen, and therefore fairly entitled to the name of " a c t . " which he gives to each of
his feats. Handkerchiefs, watches, and rings are discovered in every place hut that tn
which they wer- actually put, live animals are taken out of empty boxes, ladies are delighted

f r o m the Correspondence of t h e Hartford Times, of August 10.
The following is from Mr. D. D. Hume, who is well known to investigators of the phenomena of modern spiritual ism as a " medium " of more than
common powers. H e is now in London, and this letter was written to the Hartford Timet, it being known that here, as i s other places, the singulan
manifestations of an inexplicable intelligence and power which occur habitually in his presence have been witnessed by numerous respectable individuals. I t
appears t h a t the tangible manifestations said to have occurred frequently in this country wore also seen liy Lord Brougham and others on the occasion referred
to below. The letter develops some things which the ordinary letter-writers have not got hold of:—
Ealing Villa, near London, July 2 6 , 1 8 5 5 .
* * * In London I found but a limited number, comparatively speaking, who possess any intelligent or rational idea of the Spiritual Philosophy. T h e
subject h a s not made any great advance h e r e ; b u t those who are investigating include iu their number some of the best minds in England. T h e first call I
received was from Sir Charles E. Ischam, who has proved a must excellunt friend to me, A day or two after this I received an Ifivittiion from Sir Edward
Bulwer Lytton, to visit him at his couitry seat at Koebworth. I accepted his invitation, and had an interesting and delightful visit.
I was deeply interested iu Sir Edward, who i s , by birth, education and mind, a most superior person. Hin love of the beautiful in nature and a r t ,
but especially in nature, is manifested at every part of his wide domain. Knebworth was originally built b y a follower of the Conqueror, and was, in the
year of the Armada, occupied by Queen Elizabeth. The state room contains the bed upon which her Majesty slept. I t has rich velvet hangings—the same
which shaded the slumbers of Queen Hess. The room of the extensive library contains the oak table at which Ctomwcli, Pym A. Co, s i t while planning the
rebellion. • * * We had some manifestations at our stances almost as good as those we had at

presence in the same palpable way, by present'..,.; tangible hands, shaking hands, eta, and Sir I dward a acknowledges the corn," to use a Yankee vulgarism.

I enclose a paragraph from one of the London Journals, giving a sketch of an interview I had with Lord Brougham and Sir David Brewster. T h e
latter, as you are well aware, wrote that article in the Edinburgh Review, some months ago, in which he argued against the evidence of spirit agency in the
production of fhe manifestations, and in which he denounced the whole matter in the btiterest terms, as a delusion and an imposition. His article has been
eagerly and widely quoted by the opponents of Spiritualism on both sides of the Atlantic, and its statements an- doublless believed by those who are incapable
of appreciating or comprehending the truths which they assail.
Sir David, however, has for once met with a " stumper*" for he has seen and felt such manifestations of his spirit friends as to completely upset his
philosophy. He frankly confesses that he is •* sorely ptuzled " at what he has witnessed, and Lord Brougham acknowledges himself to be thoroughly nonplussed. Both of these DOted men brought the whole foree of their keen discernment to bear upon the solution of the phenomena ; but the presence of
substantial, actual hands, and the d-n:onstrative strength of the spirits who thus clothed themselves for the time and moved material objects about the room,
proved to be too much of • question for them to master.

THEATRE.

Lessee, Mr. J . H. ANDERSON, Burleigh Street, Strand.

This Evening (Monday) 85th Representation of M a g i c a n d M y s t e r y .
Those who have not been, should hasten at once.
PROFESSOR ANOERHOW begs to announce his

feT lOOth R E P R E S E N T A T I O N
On TUESDAY, December 11th, 1855,

On w h i c h occasion the W i z a r d will have t h e pleasure of producing something
more astonishing than he has yet accomplished.
Professor ANDERSON most respectfully requests his Visitors to secure places at the Box-oflice during the day, or be early at
'lie doors, otherwise it is impossible to obtain good seats.

Long before the names of foreign professors of legerdemain—the Houdms, the
H e r m a n s , the Holders—where known in this Metropolis, Mr. Anderson, popularly called
he " Wizard nf the N o r t h , " had an established reputation. H e was, if we are not deceived,
he first among Hie present generation who practised legerdemain in grand and brilliant
tyle. There were conjurors who engaged tavern-rooms, especially in the suburbs, where
hey performed tricks with cards, and artfully contrived boxes with more or less skill, and
n some cases legerdemain was one of the features of a miscellaneous evening*B entertainment. B u t Professor Anderson at once created a sensation by engaging a whole theatre
for the display of bis tricks alone, and increasing the ctfect of his elaborate achievements by
the splendour of his apparatus.
I t is now ten years since professor Anderson last performed hi London, and ns during
that interval several celebrated conjurors from France and Germany have successively
engaged the attention of the public, the " W i z a r d of the N o r t h , " on returning to the scene
of his former glories, h i s not unwisely deemed it inexpedient to place his sole trust in the
memory of hi* past fame. Accordingly, for several days, not to say weeks, tho streets of
London have been adorned with every possible form of placard, foretelling the re-appearance
of the " W i z a r d " at the Lyceum, on Monday, the 3rd of September. I n one place there
has been a simple announcement, in another a series ofwoodcuti representing the principal
tricks, and in some of the shop-windows a fine lithographic portrait of the Professor, that
would have passed very well for Sir John Hersehell or Sir David Brewster, to all who had
no personal knowledge of those gentlemen; for it was surrounded not by the implements ot
legerdemain, but by the instraments appertaining to real natural science. Hostile deciara
ttoiiB, professing to come from tho " Spirit-rappers," also appeared on the walls, repudiating
all connexion with the " Wizard," who it (termed was about in expose the mysteries of
modern sunernaturalism, and declaring that " Spirit-rapping " should go on in spite of all
his revelations.
From all this it was evident that a sensation might be expected last night, and certainly,
when the hour for the commencement of the Professor's performance at the Lyceum was at
hand, the excitement wa.i extraordinary. The Boxes and Stalls were at once filled Willi a
fashionable audience, and the P i t barricades were forced in, so that t h . patrons of this part
of the house, inconvenienced by the struggle, began their evening in a somewhat sulky
mood, and t r n threatened a tumult w h e i Mr. Anderson made his appearance. However,
after a few words of conversation between the Professor and a ringleader of the malcontents,

all angry feeling subsided, and neve
an entertainment of the sort \ u s off with mor
perfeet good humour.
We are not going to enter into a description of the Professor's tricks, which are of the
most elaborate and complicated kind, every one of them being, as it were, a nest comprising
half-a-dozen, and therefore fairly entitled to the name of " a c t , " which he gives to each of
his feats. Handkerchiefs, watches, and rings are discovered in every place b u t that in
which they were actually put, live animals are taken out of empty boxes, ladies are delighted
by showers of bouquets and bonbons, and gentlemen are refreshed by every description of
liquor poured from a single bottle. All these things are pleasant to see, but tedious to
describe! therefore we dismiss them with a word of general commendation as excellent ot
their kind, b u t pause awhile to record the splendour with which the whole apparatus is p n t
upon the stage. The roup tfaeil on the ascent of the curtain was truly magnificent; the stage
being converted into a large saloon, every mystic article of which was composed of som*
sparkling material, while busts of the Queen and Prince Albert, a n d the Emperor am*
Empress of the French, gave a national character to the whole. Nor was M r . Anderren'*
splendour confined to the inside of the theatre. A n electric light placed on the pedtwrn*
of the portico turned t h e night of Wellington-street North into day, and attract*.! t h .
rrgaTds of a numerous multitude.
I t was in the second part of his entertainment that Mr. Anderson introduced t h e
subject of " Spirit-rapping." Suspending two glass bells from the ceiling, placing a table
on a platform extended across the centre of the pit, and setting up and automatum figure
tin the stage, he made every one of them answer every question that he p u t as to the number
of letters composing a given word, or the number of pips on a card drawn from the pack.
The table replied in " r a p s , " t h e bell by rinsing, the automaton by gesticulation. T h e
secret by which the answers were obtained he did not communicate. H e only Btated that
the means employed were merely mechanical, b u t not more so than those employed by the
professed " S p i r i t - r a p p e r s , " who now profit so much by the credulity ot mankind, and whom
he denounced as imposters. He affirmed that while at New York he had defied a " S p i r i t rapper " to get out of the table he h a d constructed any sound that could not be traced to
natural means, and that, although he had staked a large sum of money on ihe result of the
challenge, the Spiritualist had failed to elicit any sound at all. This part of the performance was distinguished from the rest by the solemn tone with which the Professor
expatiated on the mischief done by pretended " Media," and was received with serious
applause as the more hilarious achievements were honored b y mirthful expressions ot
delight.

Ealing Villa, near London, July 2 6 , 1 8 5 5 .
* * * In London I found but a limited number, comparatively speaking, who possess any intelligent or rational idea of the Spiritual Philosophy. T h e
subject has not made any great advance h e r e ; but those who are investigating include in their number some of the best minds in England. T h e first call I
received was from Sir Charles E. Tseham, who has proved a most excellent friend to me. A day or two after this I received an invitation from Sir Edward
Bulwer Lytton, to visit him a t his country seat at Knebworth. I accepted his invitation, and had an interesting and delightful visit.
I was deeply interested in Sir Edward, who is, by birth, education and mind, a most superior person. His love of the beautiful in nature and a n ,
but especially in nature, is manifested a t every part of his wide domain. Knebworth was originally built by a follower of the Conqueror, and was, in the
year of the Armada, occupied by Queen Elizabeth. T h e state room contains the bed upon which her Majesty slept. I t has rich velvet hangings—the same

presence in the same palpable way, by presenting tangible hands, shaking hands, &c. and Sir Edward " acknowledges the corn," to use a Yankee vulgarism.
He is much interested in the subject, and lias bestowed no. small share of thought upon the m a t t e r .
I have also had the pleasure nf being presented lo the Marchioness of H
s, Baroness G....y R....n. She is a highly intellectual and altogether
charmiug lady, who possesses much native refinement, and a fearless desire to learn and follow the T R U T H . I met, too, the Earl of K
e, and the Marquis
of C
e, at one of our circles a few evenings since. A most kind friend I also found in the Vicomte de S t . Amirro, Charge d'Affaires front Brazil, who h a s
given me valuable letters to France. I am to meet him and his lady (both investigators) the coming autumn, a t the Neapolitan Court.
I enclose a paragraph from one of the London Journals, giving a sketch of an interview I had with Lord Brougham and Sir David Brewster. T h e
latter, as yon are well aware, wrote that article in the Edinburgh Review, some months ago, in which he argued against the existence of spirit agency in the
production of the manifestations, and in which he denounced the whole matter in the hti teres t. terms, as a delusion and an imposition. His article has been
eagerly and widely quoted by the opponents of Spiritualism on both sides of the Atlantic, and its statements are doubtless believed by those who are incapable
of appreciating or comprehending the truths which they assail.
Sir David, however, has for once met with a " stumper," fur he has seen and felt such manifestations of his spirit friends as to completely upset his
philosophy. He frankly confesses that he is * sorely puzzled" a t what he has witnessed, and Lord Brougham acknowledges himself to be thoroughly m-nplnwed, Both of these noted men brought the whole force of their keen discernment to bear upon the solution of the phenomena; but the presence of
Bttbitantial, actual hands, and (be demonstrative strength of the spirits who t h a i clothed themselves for the lime and moved material objects about the roMn,
proved J') he too much of a question for them to master.
Time will not allow me to mention the various interesting sittings I have had, nor tbe many distinguished personages w h o h a v e been in our clrilee
during my short stay in Loudon, I am at present enjoying the quiet of an English country home. T h e gentleman with whom L am stopping (Mr. Rymer)
is OHO of the most distinguished solicitors in London. He has been a materialist, or dislielievrr in a future >.tiite, all his life previous to witnessing those
demonstrations of spirit existence. H e is now a believer (or rather a ktum-rr) of the future life. The manifestations, so oflrn scoffed.at by professed
Christians, have done fcl him, as they have I'm upwanK of twenty-live thousand infidels and ntlicisls in America, what no power of the pulpit or doctritiM of
evangelical religion could ever have effected.
Is not this one fact alone a mtflicient reply to the otVrtp*otad question o f " what good does it all do ?" T h e r e is many a broad-loving soul that, tailing
in the elfrnt to ti.urow itself down to the limits of a dogmatical creed, has ended in infidelity, or blank atheism ; but the number of these is becoming steadily
less by the influence of the spirit manifestations, which are to them what the placing of the hand in the spear wound was to Thomas. Mr. R,, since h i s
couverMiin. has given a lecture on the subject, and will give another.
One thing 1 will not admit. Mrs. Tmllope, whom the Americans will be apt to remember, came, with her son, from Florence to London for the
express prjrpoie of seeing the manifestation. They were accordingly invited to spend a few days with me at my village h o m e ; and, I must say, 1 w s s
agreeably disappointed in hor. My previous ideas of her had not been such as to prepossess me in her favour, but I have become s o admirer of her private
character. She has none of the stiffness of the author about her, nor any of the " b l u e stocking." She enjoys the realities of existence more fully than any
one I have ever met in a circle.
The seance with her was one of strange interest. H e r son was an unbeliever, and his mother was very desirous that he should be " b r o u g h t to a
knowledge of the t r u t h . " When at length the light did beam upon his soul and the chords of his spirit vibrated in unison with the celestial harmonies that
ushered in the birth of Faith through the shadows of his old unbelief, the result was too much for his stoicism, and tears of holy joy coursed down his manly
cheeks. .Her joy was too great for utterance, a n d her rapturous emotions seemingly too great to be endured. I t was an impressive scene, and an occasion
of deep interest. There are many such in the life of a Spirit Medium.
In a few weeks I leave England for tbe Continent, in company with my friend" Mr. Rymer. We intend to reach Rome in November, where we
purpose to spend a few months, if his Holiness will let u s . You shall hear from me again.

Most respectfully announce to the Nobility, Gentry, and Public, that they have become the J O I N T
L E S S E E S of the above Theatre, which they purpose devoting, exclusively, to the production of

Si W t i S i SIDES tfPJ.yJKISD

MUSICAL AFTERPIECES.
In issuing, this advertisement, they earnestly solicit attention to the following Statement of
Facts :—ft has long been a desideratum, constantly and urgently expressed, both in the Public
Prints and otherwise, that some Establishment should be Opened for the distinct and especial
purpose of affording to B R I T I S H C O M P O S E R S , VOCALISTS AND INSTRUMENTALISTS,a fair
fiHd for the full display of their united eflbrts ; but su«h wish has never yet bee. realized.
OPKRA is a species of Entertainment, requiring the union of Such a multiplicity of
expensive essentials, that it never can be satisfactorily represented in any Theatre, wherein it
merely (and only occasionally) engages a portion of the Manager's attention; mid this is the
utmost it has ever done, even whilst the Theatres Royal were devoted to their legitimate uses :
But NOW, when three of*he principal Theatres of the Metropolis are appropriated, solely, to
the Performance of Instrumental Music, the talents of

BRITISH OPERATIC ARTISTS
are doomed to inaction and obseurity, simply from the want of a proper and legitimate sphere
for their effective exhibition.
Actuated by these considerations, and deeply imbued with an ardent lova and veneration
for the Art, the Lessees have, after tnuoh doubt and deliberation, been induced to enter upon
their present onerous undertaking.
They have had numerous and almost insurmountable difficulties to contend with J bnt have,
at length, the satisfaction to state, that such have been their eventual arrangements, that they
are enabled to submit them to the Public with a very considerable degree of confidence; and
this they <fo with the fervent hope that, as the cause to which they are about to devote their best
energies is both laudable and natit-nal, it will meet with that generous patronage and support,
which alone can crown their efforts with success.

Mr. F R A Z E R.

BRITISH OPERATIC ARTISTS
are doomed to inaction and obscurity, simply from the want of a proper and legitimate Sphere
for their effective exhibition.
Actuated by these considerations, ahd deeply imbued with an ardent love and venerafidfi
for the Art. the Lessees have, after much doubt and deliberation, been induced to entity upon
theifitresent onerous undertaking,
They have had numerous and almost insurmountable difficulties to contend with ; but have,
at length, the satisfaction to state, that such have been their arrangements, that they
are enabled to submit them to the Public with a very considerable degree of confidence ; and
this they do with the fervent hope that, as the cause to which they are about to devote their best
energies is both laudable and national, it will meet With that generous patronage and support,
which alone can crown their efforts with success..

Earnestly solicit attention to tbe following Statement of Facts :—It lias long been a dctidte*
ratunt, constantly and urgently expressed, both in tbe Public Prints and otherwise, that Some'
Establishment should be Opened tor the distinct and especid purpose of affording to B R I T I S H
C O M P O S E R S , V O C A U S T S AND INSTRUMENTALISTS, a fair field for the full display of their
United efforts ; but such wish has never yet been realized.
OPBRATIC W O R K S require the union of Such a multiplicity of expensive essentials; that
they never can be satisfactorily represented in any Theatre, wherein they merely engage a portion
of the Manager's attention; and this is the utmost they have ever done, even whilst the Theatres
Royal were devoted to their legitimate uses I But NOW, When three of the principal Theatres Ot
the Metropolisare appropriated, solely, to the Performance of Instrumental Music, the talents of

With New Music, Scenery, Dresses If Decorations. The new Music by Mr. M. CORRI, the Scenery by Mr. C. PARKERSo great has been the March of Intellect of late days, that the Louisville Journal, United States, credibly informs
its readers, that a Bear was in the nightly habit of frequenting the Pit of the Theatre during Miss Ellen Tree's Performances in that Town, and that he one evening took a Crocodile friend of his with him, who was so fascinated by
her exquisite acting of theWife, that he actually shed teai.s, real Crocodile tears I and the Vermont Mercury asserts that
during one of the representations of Mr. I'ower in Paddy O'Hafferty, in that state, a young Colt who happened to be
stabled at the back of theThoatre, accidently thrusting his head through some dilapidated boards, had his risible faculties so much "sxestcd by what he saw, that he indulged in several involuntary bom. laughs, to tha great edification
of the swinish multitude, who happened to be in trout. U is not intended to be inferred, that these instances of sympathy in what Coleridge has oddly enough called the innte creation, towards our national representations on the
other side of the Atlantic, should be followed by a corresponding observance in the present attempt to display some
genuine specimens of American humour on this ; it is only trusted that on this occasion that our biped public will not
be more fastidious than the quadruped auditors of Louisville and Vermont, but will allow their smiles to be elicited
by those homourous peculiarities and exeeislrieities which have already afforded to CousinJonathan so muchamusement, and which can have no other end than to extend our stores of harmless mirth, and enlarge the good fellow.

" To catch the living manners as they ' ride' " h a s been the principal aim of the Dramatist in mounting his PEGASUS
on this occasion. In playfully lashing (he follies he has encountered while Canterjra along the road of life, and
w a s h i n g its U P S and DOWNS, he had no other than a kind feeling.—Gently to CURB tl» thoughtless, with a ' bit of
good truth,' guide the over hasty with the reins of experience, and somewhat bridle he impetuous is the proper
pro nc of those who drive the " safety" STAGE of public recreation; the better to drau. il has been thought necessary to introduce some Animals upon the boards, but for this STBP no apology is demed requisite, it having a
precedent at present in a co temporary house, and the Beasts being quite as naluril and manageable, a . tho
" / ions" and " Tigers" that add to the attractions of other Spectacles. 'I he Vehicle of exhibiting existence as it
RUNS, among the Males and females introduced, ono has been called into the servicj whose carriage may not
perhaps be found undesiriMe, independent of a litbvry, whose aid has been freely vdunteered.
The SFORHNO
season having just commenced, and the Author being duly LICENSED, he hopes ho may te allowed to " SHOOT lolly
MS it flies," and BAO his OAME as well a s abetter man. II in one or two instances he maymiss his aim through not
having taken his SIOHT correctly, he hopes, under existing circumstances, it will not be considered his *' FAULT,"
but rather his MISFORTUNE.

Nicholas ..tficklepy
TO T H E PUBLIC.
Some of the Newspapers having named me as the person intended to be represented by
an intemperate and vulgar caricature in the last published number of NICHOLAS NlCKLBBY,
which without such information I should certainly never have suspected, it may perhaps be necessary to say a few words in order to set the Public right upon the matter.
MR. DICKENS complains that I have in the present very successful ADAPTATION of
NICHOLAS NICKLEBY, 'FINISHED' his 'unfinished work,' have 'ANTICIPATED HIS PLOT,"'which
had cost him many thoughtful days and sleepless nights.' that 1 am a Richard Turpin, a
Tom King, and a Jerry Abershaw, (that is presuming he really means me.) In fact, that I am
nothing more or less than a species of NOVEL HIGHWAYMAN, an universal ROBBER OF ROMANCE,
having dramatised no less than Two hundred and forty-seven Novels, as fast as they came out,
and very often ' Mirabile dictu,' even ' faster than they came out,' though 1 know not well how that
could be. That I have stolen his brains, (it would certainly appear that he had lost them) an act
which he considers equal in turpitude to stealing his pocket handkerchief, valuing the one at the
same rate as the other, and I know not what other atrocities besides. I certainly plead guilty to
having dramatized his Work, which 1 should not have done till it had been completed, had not
two other Playwrights dramatised it before me, a circumstance that did not seem displeasing
either to MR. DICKENS, or HIS PROPRIETORS, Messrs. CHAPMAN & HALL, as the latter themselves
actually published one of the adaptations alluded to, and thus made themselves parties to it; independently of which I did not commence my version till the original Work had been nearly fifteen
months before the Public, and the denouement was obviously in view—that I should unfortunately
have hit upon the same way of ending the history as that projected by MR. DICKENS, and thereby
have caused him any annoyance, I really regret; but there is a very essy way of making me " hide
my diminished head'' let MR. DICKENS, and he has five months before him, set his wits to work
again, and finish his Nicholas Nickleby better than J have done, and I shall sink into the primitiro
mire, from which I have for a moment attempted to emerge, by catching at the hem of his garment,
a fate I shall deserve for my Quixotic fool-hardiness in continuing as he says, 'to drag into the
magic circle of my dullness subjects not at all dramatic, cutting, hacking, and earring them to the
powers and capacities of my Actors, and the capabilities of my Theatres,' and persuading the innocent
Public, night after night to admire and applaud them.' I could wish it were generally agreed
that no original Novel, Romance, or Tale, should be made use of for dramatic, or other purposes,
without the original Author having an interest in such appropriation, but as such is not the case,
and the Works of Novelists, &c. have at all times been considered fair game to the Dramatis*
without any complaint from their Authors, I do not perceive why I should be expected to become
a solitary exception, and be debarred an advantage allowed to all others. I never Dramatised
bn;t Five Novels in my life—MRS. OPIE'S beautiful ' Father and Daughter;' S I R WALTER
SCOTTS matchless ' Ivanhoe;' SIR EDWARD BULWER'S masterly and complete ' Eugene Aram-;'
The 'Pickwick Misoellany ;' and lastly MR. DlCKENs' very clever NICHOLAS NlCKLEBY.' Had
the slightes-t intimation been conveyed to me either by MR. DICKENS or his Proprietors, that ray
using his Work would have been disagreeable or inimical, T should immediately have desisted;
but the fact is, as in the case of' SAM WELLER,' had the Work been less successfullyfinished,not
a word would have been uttered in depreciation of my using it, by MR. DlCKENS.
I willingly admit, that the common practice of Dramatising Works before their original
Authors have completed them, is an unfair and vexatious one; but it did not originate with me.
I regret MR. DICKERS should have lost his temper, and descended to scurrility and abuse, where
a temperate remonstrance alone was needed, but has suffered his irritability to make him forget
the good breeding of a gentleman, and lose sight of that sense which should ever characterize a
man of letters;—as one of his admirers, I lament he should so far have committed himself.MR. DICKENS is at perfect liberty, if it will at all gratify his spleen, to call me the veriest blockhead that ever catered for the stage: the Public have too often decided upon my very humble
pretensions, to be swayed by his ipse dixit now. Great as his talents are, he is not to
fancy himself ' Sir Oracle,' and think that when he speaks no dog should 'bark'; he should not
attempt to ' bestride us like a Colossus,' and grumble that we ' poor petty mortals should seek to
creep between his legs.' With all possible good feeling, I would beg to hint to MR. DlCKENS that
the depreciating the talents of another is but a shallow and envious way of attempting to raise
one's own—that the calling the offending party EL.thief, sneering at his pecuniary circumstances,
and indulging in empty boasts of tavern treats, are weapons of offence usually resorted to only by
the very lowest orders. Nothing is more easy than to be illnatured. I confess I write for my
living; and it is no discredit to MR. DlCKENS to say, that those who know him best are aware he
is as much indebted to his pen for the dinner of the day, as I can possibly be With respect to
the 'six hundred generations' through which MR. DICKENS expects his 'pedestal should remain
unshaken in the Temple of Fame,' I can assure him I have never anticipated that any credit
I might derive from dramatising NICHOLAS NICKLEBY would more than endure beyond as many
days. Having himself unsuccessfully tried the Drama, there is some excuse for MR. DlCKENS*
petulance towards its professors ; but it is somewhat illiberal and ungrateful, that being indebted
ta ' V stage for so many of his best characters—Sam Weller, from BEAZLEY's " BOARDING
ample—he should deny it a few in return. In putting his present Novel upon the
stag
'as no intention to injure or annoy him; and if it will be any satisfaction to him,
I JM
n that whatever offence I may have committed in the present instance, it shall not be
Uture, at least by me.
I cannot avail myseif of the-liberal offer of ' paying the Tavern bill,' asftlong and sever.
illness of nearly five years, with its consequent deprivation of sight, has during almost all that
period wholly prevented my " Taking my ease in mine Inn," however I might have wished it.
And now, hoping that MR. DICKENS may speedily regain his good humour, and indulge in a little
more generosity of feeling toward his humbler brethren of the quill, I cordially bid him farewell.
" Let the galled jade wince,
My withers are uuwrung,"

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
TIMES.
This house opened its portals last night, and, like its
brethren of older growth, put forth its claims upon the
patronage of the public. Those claims consist in the
speciality of English operatic performances, and
undoubtedly it is a speciality which, if carried out in
integrity and good faith, must ensure a fair reward.
In these days of influenza and of bronchial affections
it is a hazardous.thing to attempt to put an opera upon
the stage; but the more hazardous the attempt the
more glorious the result, and we must record upon
this occasion a complete and unqualified success. The
mechanical arrangements and appliances of the theatre
are manifestly inadequate; yet with these, imperfect
as they are, much may be done, and under the present
able management a vast deal has been accomplished.
Last night the performances commenced with Bickerstaffe's lively opera of Love in a Village. There were
a few minor incidents which might call for a critical
review, but regarding the productions* a whole great
praise must be awarded to it. Every part was entrusted
to a meet representative, and the principal characters
were in able hands. Among the ladies several new
names are seen, but it is stated that they have for the
most part made successful debuts at the Exeter-hall
Concerts. Mr. Rogerson was the Justice Woodcock,
Mr. Lefflcr the Hawthorn; Miss Rebecca Isaacs,
Rosetta; Miss E. Ormond, L u a n d a ; and Miss I. Featherstone, Madge. Miss Featherstone made a most
gratifying appearance and won general applause and a
shower of bouquets. Her voice is beautifully clear,
and her manner graceful and unaffected.
Miss
Ormond sang her rather difficult music with remarkable time and precision; her enunciation, too, was
extremely distinct. Mr. Leffler sang with unusual vigour in his cheery part, and Miss Isaacs, the talented
directress, infused a spirit and diffused a charm over
the whole which made the opening night most successful. Mr. Rogerson, Mrs. Robertson, and Mr. Frazer,
were admirable in their respective roles of Justice
Woodcock, Deborah, and Hodge.
After the opera came the National Anthem by the
entire company, admirably rendered, and all conclucluded with Lee's well known musical farce, The
Inmnf.ihlf.x..

Tf was plnypd with spirit and propriety,

and met with great approbation.

ADVERTISER.
"There is an oasis in the desert,- and when public
patronage of foreign genius and foreign artistic talent
is supposed to be on the wane, Miss Rebecca Isaacs,
directress of the little Strand Theatre, steps in, and,
with great tact, endeavours to revive the old English
opera—we are glad to say not unsuccessfully. Love
in a Village, one of our sweet English operatic productions, was last night brought out under that fair
lady's management, and, the first piece of the enterprising experiment, was entirely successful. The
characters were well cast, and the piece was as well
received, on its reproduction, as its talented author,
Bickerstaff, could have wished to see it on its first
representation—numbers and capacity of the house
excepted. Miss Isaacs, as Roselta; Miss Featherstone,
as Madge; Miss Emily Ormond, as Lucinda; Mrs.
W. Robertson, as Deborah Woodcock ,• Mr. Rogerson,
as Justice Woodcock—Woodcock!
that singular
pattern of a country justice of the old school; Mr.
Warren, as Sir William Meadows, Leffler as Hawthorn,
Fraser as Hodge, and Mr. Henry Mauley as Young
Meadows, sustained their characters with admirable
effect. Several of the songs were enthusiastically encored. The music of this charming opera, possessing
great sweetness and simplicity, was throughout admirably rendered. The little company possess considerable vocal ability; and looking at the success of
Love in a Village, a first effort in the reproduction of
our genuine English opera—long neglected—we congratulate Miss Rebecca Isaacs on the taste and spirit
that have led her to make so appreciable an enterprise,
and trust that the public will give to her and her little
troupe, the support which they so well deserve. The
" National Anthem," complimentary to Her Majesty,
was given by the company with fine effect, the audience
joining in ths chorus. The Invincibles followed, in
which the "female" part of " t h e army" were well
up in the drill.
Tuesday, March 29th, 1863.

SUN.
At this favourite little theatre last night the performances commenced with Bickerstaffe's lively opera
of Love in a Village.
There were a few mir>»«incidents which might call for a critical review, but
regarding the production as a whole, great praise must
lie awarded to it. Every part was intrusted to a meet
representative, and the principal characters were in

sd©

able hands.
After the opera came the National
Anthem by the entire company, admirably rendered,
and all concluded with Lee's well known musical
farce, The Invincibles.
It was played with spirit and
propriety, and met with great approbation.
Tuesday, March 29th, 1853.

DAILY NEWS.
This little house re-opened last night under the
lesseeship of Mr. Allcroft, with Miss Rebecca Isaacs as
directres--, and a very efficient company lor the purposes to which the theatre is to be devoted— the performance of English ballad opera and adaptions of the
lighter description of foreign musical pieces. The
performances commenced with Love in a Village,
Mr. Leffler being the Hawthorn; Mr. Henry Manley
Young Meadows; and Miss Isaaps, Rosetta.
The
pretty and simple music of ihe opera was very nicely
given, and the subordinate parts generally well
sustained; while the dresses, in the style of the period,
appeared to be new for the occasion. The evening
concluded with the musical farce of The Invincibles,
in which Mr. G. Hodson (from the Dublin Theatre)
was very successful in the part of O'Slash. By avoiding all attempts at grand opera, and keeping within
the range for which his resources are well adapted,
Mr. Allcroft •will have a much better chance of success
in his present undertaking than was afforded by th#
more ambitious effort of his Christmas season.
Tuesday, March S9th, 1853.

CHRONICLE.
Mr. W . AUCROFT, long known to the London
musical public as the caterer to its love of monster
concerts, has become the lessee of this establishment,
and appeals for support to the sympathies of those who
do not blush to avow their partiality for old English
music. His aim, as he professes, is to produce the
standard English operas and musical farces,as originally
written, as well as the lighter class of musical pieces
popular on the Continent, and with this object in view
he has secured the services of Miss REBECCA ISAACS as
directress, a selection fully justified by the very
efficient troupe of artistes which she has gathered
round her flag, albeit several of them are new. at
least, to London boards. The pieces chosen for the
inauguration of this undertaking were BiekerstaffeV
pretty opera of Love in a Village, and the musical
farce of The Invincibles, both of which; were presented
to a well-filled house in a manner highly creditable to
the management.
In the opera, the lady vocalists
came out in great force. Miss ISAACS, herself, who
has taken rank as a favourite with the town for some
time past, sustained the character of Roselta with
vivacity, and sang the music allotted to the part with
much breadth of effect, and Miss EMILY ORMOND, as
Lucinda, created a strong impression by her delivery
of the pleasing air, "Cupid, god of soft persuasion."
A little more familiarity with the stage will doubtless
impart greater finish to this young lady's style of acting
which is at present susceptible of improvement. We
are relieved, however, from the necessity of paying
any sueh doubtful compliment to the representative of
Madge, Miss Is A BELLE FEATHERSTONE, who took the
house by storm in " How happy were my days." It
is a long time since we have had the pleasure of recording so promising a first appearance. Her acting
is truthful and forcible without any taint of exaggeration, and a fresh, clear and ringing voice. .LEFFLBR
was the Hawthorn of the evening, he dressed, acted,
and sang the part well.
The opera was well put on the stage, and appeared
to give great satisfaction to a very orderly Easter
audience. The farce of The Invmeibles brought forward Mr. GEORGE HOOSON (from the Theatre Royal,
Dublin,) as O'Slash, who convulsed the house with
laughter. Let the management of the Strand Theatre
go on as it has begun, and there need be no fear of an
empty treasury.
Tuesday, March 29th, 1S53.

GLOBE.
This little theatre was re-opened last night, under
the direction of Miss Rebecca Isaacs, and the entertainment provide d reflects credit upon Mr. Allcroft, the
lessee, giving an earnest that the intention of the management as set forth in the announcement, will be fairly
carried out —that of the production of standard English
operas and musical farces. The house was well attended. Miss R. Isaacs appeared as Rosetta, and sang
the music and played the part with an archness and
freshn<>== *i«t eifcited frequent encores and applause.
Mr. Leffler appeared in his old character of Hawthorn,
and did full justice to the familiar ballads assigned to
the part. The evening's entertainment concluded
with the celebrate musical farce of'The Invincible *

And r e p e a t e d Every Evening sanctioned by t h e Audience.

The success which attended the production of " Othello Travestie" at this Theatre, has
encouraged me to attempt another Un-Shakesperian revival on the same scale. The information we possess respecting the dress worn by the Inhabitants of Scotland in the Eleventh
Century, being almost as scanty as is the dress we know they wear in the Eighteenth, makes
me deem it expedient to set at nought every opinion but my own on the* subject* In the
absence, therefore, of any positive information, I have borrowed some of the materials from
Mr. Charles Kean's instructive " Fly-leaf," and intend adopting his notions as to defensive
weapons, but retaining also the acknowledged superior weapons popular in all ages, viz., Good
Jokes, Smart Repartees, Pleasant Parodies, &c, &c. " The striped and chequered garbs" which
seems to be generally admitted as belonging to the Scotch, will be adhered to, together with
the eagle feather in the helmet, the distinguishing mark of a Chieftain. Party-coloured
woollens and cloths appear to have been commonly worn among the Celtic tribes : they will be
adopted also by me, as I am anxious the audience should see all parties (engaged by me) in
their own colours.

In the battle with Harold IL, (A.D., 1066,) the Norwegians are said to have been without
their coats of mail. In this instance it is my intention to imitate strictly the Norwegians,
and be without them too. Siward, Earl of Northumberland, and his Son, who, with their
followers, were despatched by Edward the Confessor to the aid of Malcolm, -I have equipped
in the leathern suits called Corium, which were introduced among the Saxons in the Ninth
Century, and are described as having been worn by Earl Harold's Soldiers, in 1063, in his
war with the Welsh. All my Readers who suffer from tender feet, will, I am sure, acquiesce
in my adoption of the " Corium."

There is one great fact, however, which has been overlooked by all the various commentators on the Immortal Bard, and which I take this opportunity of asserting (not meaning
to be contradicted) namely, that Macbeth without the slightest, minutest, homoepathetically
infinitesmal particle of a doubt was an Irishman, (or at least if he was'nt he will be in this
Travestie.)

According to Act of P a r l i a m e n t ,

One continuous Scream of Laughter from the rise to
the fall of the Curtain.
RESTORATION OF THE

REAL STRAND "TRAVESTIE/
SUMMARY OF THE OPINIONS OF THE PRESS:
STRAND THEATRE.
This is one of the most active little theatres in the m.tropolis. No.
vclties of every description, musical anddramatical, are brought out in rapid
succession j and no are glad to see that this spirited management meet, its
reward in large audiences. The operatic entertainment of tli. theatre is
really very good, and the singers of more than usual excellence for a house
of this rank. A travestie of "Macbeth," which was brought out on Monday evening, was very successful, and contains much ludicrous and entertain,
ing dialogue and situation.

STRAND THEATRE.
Mr. Allcroft, emboldened by his well-earned success in the English
operatic line, has produced another novelty, entitled Ma/one's Travestie of
Macbeth, an account of which is humourously given by the '• sole,' lessee,
who seems to have some soul in him—a compliment not to be extended to
many managers of the present day. This said new Maibeth is, we are
told, "according to act of Parliament," with the whole of Locke's music,
end is preceded by Mr. Jolly's un-Shaksperian overture, which, in its way,
is decidedly rather a "jolly affair,"—good, nevertheless. Our old Scottish
friend Macbeth is metamorphosed into an Irishman, and in the sequel
we find he is a true Hudibrastic character, (and an Irish one too,) inasmuch
as after being '' .Kilt" he " lives to fight another day." To sum up (which,
to give Mr. Allcroft his due, must be a " summum bonum,") we may
observe that the music, mise en scene, and acting are all good, triajuncta
in uno; and that Mr. G. Hodson does full justice to the Scottish thane in
his Irish impersonation. Indeed, the Thistle and the Shamrock blend
admirably, and judging from the well-filled boxes in the theatre, which contained numerous blushing (?) roses, we may infer that Mr. Allcroft's
catering for the public is duly (not dewltf) appreciated. Mr, Hodson is an
intelligent and clever impersonator of Hibernianism, and is an acquisition
to the Metropolitan stage. Kiss Eebecca Isaacs and Miss Featherstone,
as also the veteran Leffler, deserves especial praise for their able assistance;
and Mr. Fraser's Macduff was evidently not to be " sneezed at,' for he
proved very artistically that " killing was no murder," inasmuch as that
Macbeth soon recovered from the home thrusts of the Scottish claymore, and
the " hard hits' of the Irish Shillelah. The piece was deservedly successful on Monday night, and an excellent evening's entertainment was provided,
in addition, the novelty, Sheild's pretty opera of Hasina having preceded,
and the Invincibles followed the new travestie. A word for Miss Featherstone ; she has a capital voice, which, if cultivated for higher art. would
probably place Jier in a good position amongst our leading vocalists.

STRAND THEATRE.
This theatre is now devoted entirely to the representation of FnglUh
opera, and the circumstances under which it has opened its portals to the
public have hitherto been most auspicious. The most important event of
the past week has been the production of Malone's travestie of Macbeth.
In ibis traveslie Macbeth is an an Irishman, and finds a very able representative in Mr. G. Hodson, who has an excellent style. One of his
greatest charms is in an air of ingenuousness which persuades the audience
he is actually the character he is representing. In this artist we welcome
a great and important acquisition to the London stage in the line of Irish
characters: Miss Eebecca Isaacs has performed both in this operatic
extravaganza and (as the heroine) in S-hield's opera of Rosina. One of
the ihings that strikes us most forcibly in Miss Kebecca Isaacs is her
wonderful improvement, Ker voice and execution are now brilliant. She
has softened down in a manner that con scarcely be credited all the faults
and peculiarities of her style which may be remembered by those who saw
her some years ago. Her voice appears now to be under her control, and
her acting is marked Anther by extravagant gestures now excess of energy.
She is admirable throughout! and her brilliant notes come forth with
a delicacy of tone, and aplomb, and an cfi'ectthat bring down ihe loudest
. applause. There have been full houses lately—so full, that we should not
be surprised to see the company, by-and-by, transferring the scene of their
operations to a lager theatre.

STRAND THEATRE.
The small vocal party which Mr. Allcroft has assembled for the
pleasing performance of slight ntusical pieces, and occasionally of domestic
opera, prospers abundantly, being free from competition at any of the
metropolitan theatres. A fair sample of humour, if humour can be pardoned in the perversion of such a noble work as Macbeth, was offered on
Monday, when the bill contained a quiz of Charles Kean's affickc, printed
like his own a fly leaf. The Scottish tyrant was metamorphosed into an
Irishman, with a broad brogue, and a conscience as unsettled as his last
year's tailor's account, till steeled to the deep damnation of Duncan's
taking off by the importunities of his ambitious wife. The three witches,
or rather two of them, adopt the dress of Bloomers, in a visit on the sly to
the Casino, which accounts for Macbeth't doubts as to their sex. In the
cauldron scene a villanous compound (frequently admitted into burlesques)
of rank evils completes the witch's charm, and the Thane of Cawdor is
perfectly sure of bis safety, since he has to fear no one " born in the usual
way." Macduff, however, a man of no birth, since he never bad a mamma,
having been brought home in the doctor's pocket, ends the story by
encountering and conquering Macbeth with broad-sword, shillaleh, and
fistycuffs, when Ihe murdered parties are resuscitated for the old dance of
" Pop goes the Weasel."
STRAND THEATRE-MACBETH

TRAVESTIE.

On Monday evening, after the performance of llosina, to a very
crowded audience, Mr. Allcroft produced The Tragedy of Macbeth,
aeeording to Act of Parliament, with the whole of Locke's music. A
comic "fly-leaf" to the play-bill—after the manner of Mr. Charles Kean,
at the Princess's—has been put forth by Mr. Alkroft, who has, however,
elicited one important fact no* already known to antiquarian authorities,
namely that "Macbeth was an Irishman, or, if he wasn't, he ought to be,"
and shall be one at, this theatre, where Othello, another Sbaksperian hero,
acquired immense popularity some seventeen years since, as a real Milesian
Moor. The representative of the Hibernian Thane was Mr. G. Hodson,
an actor with a brogue of unmistakably native culture) whose acting and
singing were full of vigour and rich humour. Some of his parodies were
enthusiastically applauded aud encored. He was well supported by Miss
Isabelle Featherstone, in the character of Lady Macbeth, who sang with
exc ellent effect. A magic lantern transparency thrown upon a white cloth
so as to form the landscape in the second witch scene, where Hecate and
her attendant spirits are by some means made to glide o'er " hills and
mountains," produced a novel and pleasing effect. The whole of Locke's
music was, with the exception of the " cauldron scene" given with the
original words, by Miss Rebecca Isaacs, Miss E . Ormonde, Mr. Henry
Manley, and Mr. Harrison as the Witches, with Mr. Leffler as Hecate.
This seemed rather incongruous in a burlesque, but the audience were so
well satisfied with the beautiful words and music to which they were
accustomed, rendered with remarkable taste and skill, as to require no

alteration in either. The extravaganza terminated as usual with the
resuscitation of the deceased characters, who joined most amicably in the
popular dance of " Pop goes the Weasel,'* upon which the curtain went
down amidst loud applause. Mr. Allcroft then cam. forward, and having
begged indulgence for some deficiencies in the representation, owing to the
haste with which the piece had been produced, announced it for repetition
every evening. A call being made for the author, Mr. Allcroft informed
the audience that the extravaganza was written by Mr. Hodson—not Mr.
Hodson, the actor. Altogether, the piece stands a fair chance of becoming
very popular, a result that may be attributed rather to the talent of the
performers than the author.
NEW STRAND

THEATRE.

Macbeth is a great hero—great in travestie as given here—and great
also at the Princess's.—True the New Strand hero is not loquacious in that
choice vernacular of the auld Reeky, but he indulges in a soft Milesian
accent, according, we presume to Malone. He is a broth of a boy, that
uses a shillelagh, toe's it at a Minister festival, or sees spirits in their
ardent form and not in turning boxes—Charles Kean also carries a stick
in Macbeth, that always reminds us of the one carried by Rambo Sambo, the
Indian juggler, and which might in a similar manner afford amusement as
an episode of conjuring by balancing it on the nose or chin. We prefer,
however, the IVew titrand Macbeth of the two, the music is equally, if not better sung here, and there is more real fun in the piece than at the Princess's;
whilst the actors even it they do clip the ' h" now and then in their delivery
of the text, have poetic licence in a travestie, so that it does not strike so
harshly upon the ear as it does when the performers are going in for a bit
of legitimate at the other house. Taken altogether, the Macbeth here
is a good and seasonable hit, and even the large quizzing posters in ridicule
of Charles Kean's M Essay on Costume" is not devoid of point, and shows
the absurdity of people attempting to write about what they do not understand. Rosina, the best of Shield's operas has been revived here, and
affords a good opportunity for those who like chaiming and graceful
melody, to hear one of the best productions of the old English composers.
The parts are well sustained by Miss Rebecca Isaacs, Leffler, Manley, and
Hudson.'

STRAND THEATRE.
The travestie of Othello, brought out here so successfully some time since,
prompted the management to try it on with Macbeth, and on Monday out
come the bills, headed with " A New Irish Operatic Extravaganza," entiled
Macbeth, '• according to Act of Parliament." Mr. Allcroft following the
example of Mr. Charles Kean, issued a " fly leaf," on which he somewhat
facetiously states bis molives for introducing the Thane in a new light. To
suit the purpose of the drama, Macbeth is a red-hot Irishman, who keeps
the audience in a continuous state of cachinnatory excitement. The
dialogue is principally in droll rhymes, made up of strange history, seasoned with jokes, stale, new, and sometimes coarse—smart repartees, pleasing
parodies, and flashes of wit, while the vis comica is increased tenfold by
the humour of Macbeth (Mr. Hodson), whose face, as he utters a pleasantry, or expresses some embarrassment, is in itself a signal for a roar.
Previous to the play the band rattle through an overture, intentionally unShaksperian, arranged by J . M. Jollye, and during the performance the
whole of Locke's music is played or sung. The hero of the piece is Phelim
O'Macbeth, who is gay, sorrowful, brave, bold, and " a l l of a h e a p "
with fear in rapid mutations of time. P'unny enough, the interlocutions during his temporary rule partake of the idioms of all three king.
doms. Mr. Hodson is unquestionably a clever actor in his line, and
does a great deal not "writ down," Could he, however, see himseif at
times as we and others see him, we fancy his characters might be
improved if done a little less " brown." The music of Locke—now
becoming as familiar to the Million as the National Anthem—was a
very even performance. Some of the scenery elicited applause, and,
at the end of the play, a loud call was made for the principal W ten
(Miss Isaacs), for Lady Macbeth (Miss Featherstone), for Hecate (Mr.
Leftlcr), for another "fly by night (Mr. Manley),and last, not least, the
mirth-provoking " Mac" (Mr. Hodson), The play-going public consider the travestie in question to be a decided hit; If full houses afford
a just commentary to the text, the questiou is settled. A new musical farce, the joint production of Messrs. Fitzball and Allcroft is to bo
produced in a few days.
STRAND

THEATRE.

The novelties produced at this house, and the gerieral nature of the
performances have drawn numerous audiences during the past week; and
the character of the entertainments is assuredly such as is well calculated to
ensure frequent visits from those who have once witnessed them. Shield's
very pretty English Opera of "Rosina" has been played first, and the
strength of Mr. Allcroft's operatic corps being more than adequate to the
effective apportioning of every part, the representation has been such as to
elicit the Warmest approbation. Messrs. Manley and Leffler fill the two
principal male characters most satisfactorily ; and Mr. G, Hodson, aa an
Irish labourer, materially increases his rising fame as a rich full-brogued
representative of Hibemia's sons. The chief burden of the plot, however,
rests with the female performers, and seldom, indeed, have Rosina, Pombe,
and William, K - - » " t J > ; " r " ' " 1 " " 1 " " 1 1 ' " ™ - »«!>•«.» W « ,
E . Ormonde, arid I . Featherstone. The former looked the part to perfection,
and sang its .nusic with peculiar sweetness and effect. Miss Ormonde likewise obtained much and well-merited applause in her vocal efforts; this
young lady's acting is rapidly improving as she gains more confidence in herself and familiarity with the stage. Miss Featherstone
looked so pretty and warbled so deliciously, that Phoebe's heart must, indeed liavt* been an obdurate one to resist such fascinating influences.
The orchestra, which, considering the size* of the theatre, is of great force,
deserves special mention for the creditable manner in which the instrumental
music «vas given. The principal performers were all summoned before the
curtain at the termination of the opera, amidst a tumult of general applause.
A burlesque on " Macbeth" followed, being intended as an accompaniment
we presume, to the famous "Othello," according to Act of Parliament,"
produeeu during the late Mr. Hammond's management of the Strand
Theatre- The m °st attractive portion is the readering of Locke's music
by a well-trained chorus, and the principal vocalists of the theatre. An
occasional laugh is created by Mr. Hodaon's personation of Sir Phtlm 0
Jllacbeth, Shakspete' Thane of Cawdor, Paddyised for the moment.
Macdttff't announcement to the terrified Macbeth that his birth, although
not effected by being " untimely ripped" from his mother's womb, according
to the Shaksperian version of that event, was brought about by befog discovered in the doctor's pocket, created immense laughter j and a lively dance
with the peculiar title of " Pop Goes the Weasel, brought down the curtain
amidst universal acclamation. Mr. Allcroft announced Mr; Hodson as the
author.

Opinions of the Press on the Gorgeous Burlesque Spectacle of Nitocris:
be pleased. There was some " excellent fooling " by the gentleman who
played the part of Nitocris. The action of the piece followed that of the
play at Drury Lane pretty'closely, and the situations translated iu,„ Burlesque were olever, and thoroughly appreciat-d by the auuience The
admirable acting of the performers cariied the piece through triumphantly

After which—the Renowned

NITOCRIS

REYNOLDS' N E W S P A P E R , O C T . 27th.
A laughable burlesque upon the Drury Lane " Nitocris "was played for
the first time on Monday, and with immense succes. The plot and language are clever parodies on the original, although that modern creation,
the " Batcatcher's Daughter," figures far more conspicuously than Egypt',
Queen. Miss Somers gave a musical version of the former lady's adventures, introducing several smart and telling hits at passing event,. Mr.
Shalders, as the " rack> tty " Queen, created intense mirth, by his humnrou,
assumption of female modesty and queenly dignity. Misses Cuthbert and
Bennett both aided materially to tile piece's success, and a pretty ballet,
in a brilliant costume, headed by Millie. Hirande, acquitted itself admirably. Ttie Sceuerv ts very cleverly executed : a caricature of the
gigantic sphinx, which figures iu the original representation of ** Nitocris,.
«as fill of character, and worthy the pencil of Leach. The burlesque
was received with loud ap ilause, and at its close, the author, Mr. Collins
was summoned before the curtain.

Performance to commence at Seven o'clock

EVENING N E W S ~ O C T . 33rd
" Atr. C, 3. Collins is one of the cleverest burlesque writers of the day.
l a this, the ni'*t difficult of all classes of stage writing lie revels and excels ; b«t when the public taste for the absurd and grotesque cools, as in
good time it will, %e trust to see some loftier dramatic achievements from
oar old (Hi nd's poetic quill. I t was only the other night that Mr. E. T.
Smith produceii, at Drury Lane, the ponderous drama of " Nitocris."
Last evening, thanks to the skill of Mr. Payne's scene-painter, and Mr.
Collins' wit, much fun was got out of—by antithesis—the lugubrious
.pectMc'e. Magnificent dresses, new silk fleshings worn on the wellturned limbs ot a host of pretty women, who laboured hard and successfully,toplease the B/jtish public, and very creditable scenery, make the
new piece go off'like a bottle of "well-up" Champagne. Mr. Shalders
was richly comic a s the Queen; Miss Cuthbert as the Taghragh, the
E t h i o p i a , merry and musical; Miss Bennett, always careiul and clever,
excellent as A-Man-o'-Fistj while Miss Somen was sly and artlul as
kinehm, and made the most, in very beautiful and fanciqul attire—as she
alwa_\» does—ol a very well-turned pair of limbs and sky-blue boots.
The celebrated Ratcaicher is introduced into ihe piece, and there are several al!u<ioU8 throughout it to his too celebrated offspring; but the connection of the Ratcatcher with the inc-dents of the drama escaped our
critical watchfulness. A new song, " Who's Your HatifiT," sung by Miss
Somere, was encored, and will doubtless improve upon acquaintance, and
become very popular. Mr. Collins was vociferously called for at the
termination of the piece, and caine iorth upon t i e stage bowing his
acknowledgments.

MORNING ADVERTISER, O C T . 23rd.
" A gorgeous burlesque spectacle, in one act anil many tableaux, was
brought, out here last night, and is rather a par.jjhra.se than a parody on
the Drury Lane speolaole. - The story is followed so close that the plot
need not be detailed, thimgh there is a constant reference to the Rat-catcber
Mid his still more celebrated daughter, which wag hiehly effective with
the galleries. The language we may at once dismiss, by saying it is
equaltoits great original.
"* There h a , been considerable effort made to get up a showy burlesque,
and it has well succeeded, and the author (Jilt. .Collins) stands in the
same relation to the drama, as does the author of the original Nitocris.
The audience were highly delighted, and all who think it pleasant to pass
an hour and half with showy dresses, changing scenes, lively parodies,
blight eyed d.iihsels, for ever dancing, and no inconsiderable quantity of
light, noise, and show, may turn in to the litteiheatre in the Strand."

Wednesday, December -2*3, and during t h e Week.
Tke Performance will commence with a Drama, adapted from the French, by J. Robertson, Esq., entitled

"AIR In the Downs" A Davy Jones'Loeker

The Arti»t, Mr. Saunders, determined to stand a* a candidateforpublic favour, has set about his canvas in the most spirited maimer, and has very unnecessarily
coloured himself up to the eyes at the praise bestowed on his beautiful scenery. For the Music, M r . M u s g r a v e ha* deeply dipped into-1 >ibdin, and dived into
divers others, made use of a great deal of Kosin i for his string instruments, picked all he could of Locke, and would, in his desperation, have laid hold of Handel,
if he could turn it to account. The necessity for entirely new Dresses has unfortunately occasioned a great piece of work between I , - . C a n t o r and Miss Balls,
but all difference* are now adjusted, and they have made it up together in the most amicable manner. The Masks, selected from those worn by the most hollow
hearts, with whom it has been the misfortune of Mr S h o v e l l i n g to come in contact. The high " Deus ex Machiuu " whose ideas tCmntch ant/ by M r . T u r n e r .
lb*. P a y n e has moutned this, his hobby, with so much completeness, that however he may lose at the start, he expects to be the favourite in the long run, and
the winner at the finish.
