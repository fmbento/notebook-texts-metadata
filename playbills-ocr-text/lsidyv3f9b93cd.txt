The houfe, though fplemltd in its appearance, was graced but by few characters of diliinfMoa. ia the box next the Princefs Royal and thePrin-:efs Aagufta, fat Lady Salifbury, with a large ■tarty; Lady Wonjbwall, Mrs. Steele, Mrs. Penn, ind Monfteur Calonne, were amongfl the few )thers of dillinction who were prefent.
THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
hx-xr-if tjf] Druryjdni_
Mifs Lee’s new Comedy of The N m Peer agi was performed on Saturday night, for the fifth time, to an audience exceedingly numerous and
genteel---This piece, appears gaining fail ground
in public fivar, and bids fair to'be no lefs profitable than honorable to the mother of the bantling. Mrs. Crouch’s accident was unfortunate in both refpefts, to a young authorefs and valuable a&refs ; but the readinefs of Mrs. Brereton in becoming fo able a fubflieute, has prevented any material injury to the piece. She was on Saturday night much applauded, and wfith great delert, fince to her readinefs the run has ruftained no lois beyond the interruption the bufinefs of the Theatre neceflarily requires.
Mrs. Forlltr fupplied Mrs. Crouch’s p'ace in Richard Cœur de Lien, with great ability.
Among the fafhionable attendants were, the £>dke of York, Duke of Bedford, Lord Sandwich, Lady Salifoury, Lady Elizabeth York, Mrs. Fitzroy, Mrs. Manwairing, Mifs Jeffries, Mrs. M'Lcod, See.

This Tragedy was lad night bro- hr forward, with the added attraiUon of the rainr of Mrs. Static ns, who has not for feme ti ne performed that principal charaft.r. That the attraflion was felt, was evident, from the app*srance of the houfe; and we need fcarcely add that the attendance svas fully repaid.—We have feen Mrs- Siddons play with more force, but feldom more chaftely, or with more correfpondence to the charafter.
What was gained in this particular, svas, perhaps, loll in another ; for Mr. Kemble did not play. He was prevented by indifpofition, and Mr. Barrymore fuflained the chara&erof Percy.

Cobb's Opera of Loye in the Eaft, or Adven tures.of Twelve hours—which has been io lonj delayed on account of Mrs. Jordan’s unfortunati indifpohiion—was performed yefterday eveninj the firtl time-—and received with all that warmtl of applaufe which has ever diltinguiflied thi Gentleman’s dramatic efforts.
The charaders were thus reprefented :

to what, we are generally aceuiiomed to in productions of this kind—for contrary to the ufual operatic IV Hem—pointedobfervatjon—highly fea-foned with the true a-tic lalt, pervade the whole performance—in fhort—fenfe very happily accompanies found. ,
The ferious parts—particularly in the fecond and third acts'—demand the pruning-knife—thole pans which charm us in the clofet too often retard and deftroy ttic itage effedt they are intended tc produce.	”
The mufic is moitiy fcledled—the overture wc were too late to hear, and can therefore only depend upon report—which fpeke mod favourably for Mr. Lmley—The longs by this popular and elegant compofer were dilhibuted among Willi £fc»cs—Jack Bunnilter—Mrs. Crouch—pignum —and Romanzini—who did them ample juftice, (telly was particularly at home in P.teiiello’s famous burletta air of “ The guardian, dear Sir.” Though rather too long for an encorfe, it met with one.	,	,
Jack-Banliifter had two airs—one by Linley— the other by Cimarofa ;—the latter he gave with much tafl.ei feeling, and fpirit. Indeed, in ths whole ch-araf'tt r ot the Englifli Taylor, Cobb has' taken the moil exact mcafurc of his comic friend.
Badbeley made the molt of Colonel Baton. His air and addiefs afforded a {biking portrait of t.w charaeferitlic gait ana gallantry of the French nation ; who iupport their favourite motto of Vive la Bagatelle, in fpite of the formidable attacks of old age and rheumatifm.
Romanzmi Wat every thing the author could have wiilied in llofario; file was throughout lively and inteteihng : her fecond French air promiles to rival that in Richard;—we never heard more exouifite harmutu.-.
bVTrs. Crouch looked ana fang molt delightfully : ùcr firft air of *• Hear me, O Goa of Love,” was the identical one in which Mrs. Sheridan firll charmed the public ; the fecond by Linley, of “ Hope bids plcufyrc/1 is a charming Rondçau, and was as charmnpgly executed.
Dignurrl, Mßlliames, King, Mrs. If'¡I/oit, MJs Pope, and Miß Collet, were all extremely perfect in their rcfpective paits.
The iinale to the lecond act ihould be changed. “Joan faid to John” is a pretty catch, but tnhappily neither King nor Mils Pope “ are dogs at -a catch.”
The firit chorus is adapted to an original Ca--.himire dance ; and the concluding one to the amous Gondolier’s rowing melody. They were noth much applauded.
The lcenes are extremely beautiful j —the nrft is an exact representation of Calcutta, taken from a defign of Mr. Hodges ; it is fo exadt a re-femblance as to give an idea of each particular houfe belonging to the principal inhabitants ;— many of them were pointed out ted us by thofe who were well acquainted with their fituition. The lad lcene affords a picturcfque and elegant view of an Indian garden. The grove of Beetle trees is novel and linking; and indeed the whole ot the garden is well laid out.
The Opera was given out for a fecond repre-fentation without a dilfeuting voice ; and we have no doubt but “ Love in the Rail” will prove a valuable acqutfition to the trealury ot this theatre-

•A'fOri'l THEATRICAL?. /7AJ
The following IS the plot of the Farce, pi.tyec For Baddeley’s benefit. An ambitious old mar Was going to town with his daughter to fee hei married to a Baronet. The Baronet is one c thofe gentleman, whoft example added lb Vnucf to the rage for boxing, and is driving to Odian to fee the famous fight. The intended bride ha; a lover who meets her on the road, hoping to b< able to carry her off. Affifted by the hurry anc confufion of the fcene, he accompliflies this, am the Baronet is left to beWail his folly—the Lady’s fortune being very neietfary to his circuit] fiances.
The fcene lies at all inn on the read to Odiham, and the Author has contrived to introduce a variety of charadters (fbme comic though) running down to that fcene of foil/. The extortions of an Inn, at fucli a time are happily ex poftd. The objedl of the Farce is a dciirablc one, and wc were pleafed to fee it played with thi iucccfs it merited.
JIADAME MARA.
“ \ Taw her yefterday—
“ In my Mind s ejre.-Hoiatx."
Such a quotation might be perfectly applicable to the PlayheU/e ofyefterday’s World.
Much is there reported of Madame Mara—and her exertion?*-thofe rxerthns We truft The Times have not been backward.in tekn-nvlodging—but, eager as we have ever been to pay the commendatory tribute to Mara’s ‘excellence, we have not paid it unjuftly—we have never “ Robbed Peter to pay Paul," for fo fliould we have done bad we praifed Mara’s manner of executing ** Water parted."
“ Water parted," in Ar taxerxes, in the fir if place, does ftet come within the description ci a Bravura ait—not to mention a few elegant epithets which the ingenious reporter of The World has fo very elegantly laviflied on one of the moft beautiful compoiitious that ever graced a* Enghfb Theatre.
But hud “ Water Parted” deferred all that torrent of abufe—we mufl have parted with cam-men fenfe as well as truth—’ere we had given an txali and technical account of exertions which sever exifled-^-or had given merit to Madam Mara at the essence of Mrs. Crouch.

!
THEATRICAL MIS A A' IHROPH1'. &
Since the dc ith of Henderfim, we have,jot h^ any' perfon who has made a tolerable good appearance in the favourite character of Hamlet. Holman was as much too flippant, as Kemble is ftiffand ped ntic, and as to poor Hill tie feems as ill calculated for Denmark’s Prince, as Mrs. Siddons is for the young and beautiful Ophelia.
Tragedy has fome fupport from Smith, Aid Pope. Smith not only fpeaks, but looks and walks with the Dignity of a man above the common herd, and Pope advances fail; to perfection.
Kemble by his filler’s interell has been advanced tp parrs above his abilities,-' and the’ papers,of late have f tile* by fome It range perverfion of judgment, and former opinion, into a kind of panegyric in his performances. The public indeed preferv* the utne fentiments as ufual. He is too much the Pedant ever to make his way to th; heart of an audience, and too fond of his m-.'p reading, infiead of giving what his author meant, to‘pleaie a goad Critic* All isjrt—evei£ word, the effetl offtiidy, and every’ look, and every ftep the work of practice. Hence he mutt always be confined to a te\v parts, and thofc he muft long prafiice in his oiva-way before they are admiflible upon the it age,
lPlough tan in all probability will fill moil of Smith’s parts : It is on this dependance, that our long clteemcd favourite takes iris final farewcl of the ftage. "He often declared he would not quit the Theatre until it had a fuhltitute ; and had fuch a one been found three years ago, he would then have taken leave of the public. To his good judgment, London fiends inuebtod. for Mrs. Jordan. He faiv her perform at York, and immediately got her engaged for Drury Lane.
in the comic line, Edwin 1’uuds confuicuoufly forward: but he is by no metns-equal to the eminence of Parlous, who (lands unrivalled in every part he undertakes. Edwin’s excellence is what the Italian call a Bttjfa Car kata, and in that line he is admirable.
Quick's chief merit lies in the oddity of his voice and perfon. There is, however, fome natural humour about him, which calls fora laugh in many characters, and he appears to greatcil advantage in ftrong Burlefque.
Bowden was brought into notice more by Mrs. Billingten’s fweet pipe, than either by the flrength of his voige or the length of his nofe. He has a bad memory, and aworle add refs, fo that nature calculated him for an orchellra, and not for a ftage. His fucceftbr, itfeentsis to he Ran-niiler, and he mufl be the moil ill-natured of all ill-natured people, who do not fay that Charles has the fined voice that ever founded a bafs note on the Britifti ftage.—Bowden by performing wish Mrs. Billington thought he brought money
to Covent Garden-----“ How we apples fwim”
but Bowden without Mrs. Billington could net draw, even a gallery (Wiling. Let him therefore not plume LttnlHf on his own confequence without he rom antes the fable of “ the Fij and the Chariot wheel ”
Barley*— at the head of a club “ hajl fellow well met” lings moil admirably, as the rinj-ing of glaffes, and the thumping of fills denotes whenever- he prefides. His voice is a good one, but he wants the aid of Science, the poirellion of judgment;—.uid what is a very great misfortune he is now too old to obtain the afiift.mce of either. Attention however, has greatly improved lum ot late years, and he is of rrfocb more confccjuence to the Theatre than he ufed to be.
This is enough for the prefent, and thofe who dont like it, need not be at the trouble of reading the next. *
Mrs. SiJdoas hxi certainly had a reveriionary promifetf the iljymarket Theatre, but at the preliir.g fqiicitaiiin of two noble Lords high in office, it is fdd th-* p-oa.ife has been waved, and that the junior Col.na i will fucceed his father in ail hisfesnte pofielEons. h. nr-10 Ijfij

LAST Saturday right Sbaicefpear ’s Comedy of Twelfth Night,- with Richard Cceur de Lion, was performed at this Theatre. In the reprefentation of this piece the merit* of the performers have been already fo much the fubjetSf of eulogium, that little beyond the bare mention of win fills the parts is necelTary. Dodd’s Sir Andrew, andPdmer’a Sir Toby, are finiihed exhibitions, wherein the true nú cómica is (hewn with the nioit forcible coulour:ng of nature.
The Viola of Jordan» were it poffiblc, we (hould be inclined to afiert, increafed with every fucceeding reprefentation, fo admirable is "her delineation of female fweetnefs joined with manly ftnfe ; nor muft we omit the Olivi of Mrs, Crouch, who had little lefs claim to applaufe in it than in the rnoft favo.írite put (he fo often and powcifully excites approbation.
Beníl y fuftained Malvolio with his ufaal
correclnefs.

verend Editor of a
Public Advertiler.
Mr. KEMBLE,
ffch- ^ n<w
T is neither a new ■nor very profound obfcrvalion that public animsdverfion is morel'alutary to public men than the par^ tiality of all their friends, and the venality of all their de-_ pendants. The Re-Moroiog Paper, who
fcovrers charafters like Swift’s dirty mop, has placed the merits of his friend on a level with thofe of poor Garrick; and though I fhnnlil have tiiven no credit to any delcription by fuch a driveling univerfal dauber, whofe ertek-brained profe is lefs intelligible than PHioi’s ; and whofe quotations are beneath thofe of Partridge ; y«t as he was fatd to live in habits of dhily intimacy with the perfon he described, I concluded he would not have offered’yon fuch art injury without Co me pre» vions knowledge that you was unoffended by the compjffifon. 1 confniered therefore the puff as a fort of advertifi-ment from yourfelf of your new pjvtenftons ; I admired your fpirit, wilhed well to the attempt, and attended with curiofity four neat appearance at Drary-lnne. I wil' acquaint you with the refuit. -I had been pr.ftm at your performing there on other «ccnlidns; had heard veur name mentioned wish f>me r -gret as the intended (utceffor to Mr. Smith, and the ue-^pe>a*,vqnven.cion on your appearance fifed to be, * how much yon refeipbled Mrs. > Siddonaj’’ n ver, as I recolleâ, how much yoq, resembled the character you was by the play-bills foppèfed to perfonate. I am forry to add, n»-.«lher Emotions were excited in me, or iu thofe around me, than we had before experienced.; nor did I hear any other remarks relating tc.yourfclf in a circle not in-edifffrfed to conveiiation, except that thé .drtifs were new and rich ; in which article I will allow you-ai much fuperiority over the liberality of Garrick, as-every man, fpending Jthe fnoftey of h's employers, is entitled to, above one who isfpending his own. The part you performed that evening was Lord fowflley, for which your folemn didaétse manner might have beea conceived not inadequate; and yet. to my fight and heating I had never an idea of the character longer I than for a fiogle featenc ;• which; after a ftu-died Tirade, recurred with the moil fcrtipu-lous monotony of cadence, and. uniformity of manner. In (lead of an entire part, varied according to the feene, yet never broken; in (lead of tranfitions fo eafy as to produce their effeif, and yet elude all difeovery whilfi they were pafiing ; infiead of department and manner fb fpirited and graceful as to challenge impunity if the poffeffar was lefs perfeft ; infteid, I iiy, of thefe, and num-berlefs other qualities which ebay who remember Mr. G rrick may conceire more eafily than ¡efcrtbe, what was your representation of Lord fownleyi bnt a disjointed fucceffion of artifice too Dalnable to feduce.
and too uniform n»t to difguft, and a feries of (trained exertions without grace or fpirit, and iaDorious declamation without fire or effect?
In your occafional efforts at fluency, which I fear you will never attain, you often relin-quifhed propriet y; as in pronouncing the words,
“ It is indifferent to me whether a black ace or a powdered coxcom > is in poffeifion, See.” the audience would-conceive from the emphafis, or rather want of it which you feemed to affeft ; nof that it was indifferent which of j the two p iffeffed Lady Townly’s heart, but whether her heart was pofiefled or not t.y either. To foeak more in general, I for one cannot allow yen the rank claimed by your injudicious friend, becaufe I cannot admit a performer of fentences who ftrews the ftage with the disjunBa membra poeta to be an «flor, any more than cur poetical critic would allow the fftinger of wrrds in a dictionary to be an author. If I may borrow Hogarth’s expreffion of the oppofites to grace, I fear your confirmed habits are fo angular and full of afperitus, that they are incapable of fufficie&r poblh even from your allowed diiigenee; but your better fuecefs in future, to which 1 am as much a well-wither as your flatterers, is not the foie motive of my addiefling you in print. Your conduit, as Manager, is of more importance to the public, than the fuccefs of your exertions as repreientative of a fine gendeman o r a hero. Your predeceffor was a man ot perfect good tafte, and a deferved favourite of the town; perbips too much fo to be fafficirntly dependent on his employers ; and l fear a great avowed Whig on another (lage, was like other abfolute Monarch» in his own kingdom; I mean defirous that his Minifter lhouJd depen 1 more on himielf than on his popularity for fupport. As however the relation you bear to Mrs. Stddons and other confiderations, which it is needlefs for me to mention, make it probable that you will lorg continue in the direction of the Theatre, Ido, as an admirer ot the ftage, deprecate your attention to fuch fnlfotce flatteries, as it appears you are likely to hear ; 1 deprecate any hired applaufe fcattered through the Pit; lolicit your imitation of Mr. King’s modelly and good fenfe ; and, above all, adjure you nottopoifon iheveryfourcesof our amufement (•• from your fituation you may eaftly do) by diffeminafi.ng your imperfections and talle tafte amongft the rifiug candidates for public favour, which however I fhonld never Have fufpedted you was capable of attempting, if I did not think a critic, who amends Shake-fpeare without authority or fcruple, and in his very Noviciate conceives himftdf fuperior to Garrick, is not likely to become more diffident by the increafe of flattery, or more modeft from a continuance of power.

Aftettlie Tragedy of JANE SHORE, a Comedy of three ads, trljcii from "Tit IVeli’Tis No Worfe, and culled 7f>e PANNEL, "¡» perform, «d for the ftrii time, and favourably received. ’7u WtU 'Ta No IVerfe was a tianflation firon* the French by Bicker ft afFe, and wa* brorght out at Drury-lane Theatre, in NwvMtiber» 17 70, where, although it was noil powerfully performed (efpeciaUy the two cliaraôtr» of Beatrice and Muf-cato, by Mrs. Abington and Mr. Jhingj) it did not keep its hold, being vioktttly oppofed on tl»e firfl. night of reprefentation, and laid «fide as foon as the ninth was over. It has now been ctlt into an aftei-piece ; and at it is full of comick incident, and is in fait a fort uf fpeaking paiUomime, it will probably continue to excite laughter during the winter. The characters were in general well affed. Mrs. Jordan played the pat* of Beatrice pieafantly, but not fo well as Mrs. Abington had done before ber. Bannifter was fucceftful in Mufcato, and had we not feen King in thé fame charaâer, we fhould have pronounced Baaniftcr’t performance fuperlatively good. Mrs. Goodall looked and a ¿ted very prettily. Mrs.' Kemble was interefting in Aurora, and Baddeley and R. Palmer each (hewed their flciO and comick poweis in Don Guzman and Lazarillo.
The dreffes were new and handfome, bnt Mrs. Jordan’s was wholly out of charaéter ; furely no Spanifb file de chambre was ever fo dreiicd before. Abrngtun, we recolkâ, wore a neat fluff jacket and petticoat, with hanging fleeves and puffs, fucli as a Spaniih waiting woman might be fup-pofed to wear, and not a fhewy fatin robe and petticoat fit only fora^agedyjQueen.
Mrs. BiOington is faid to have two airs in the Prophet allotted her, which are inthe bravura ftyie, and are reported to equal any thing that (he Has yet fang« eitner m the Daenua or Robin Hood.
Of Pil »n’a Ward in Chancery nothing is at prefer t faid. We hope, however, that it will he put in the hands of fome fucceftful wi iter and finimed for dramatick repn. (cotation.
O’Keefe’s Valentine and Orfon is another piece of which much was once anticipated, thourh it feeds* to no purnofe. Perhaps, hovre^r, the p(ece was never written.

The Author of The Theatrical Traits, fignea Polydore, is dfired to recanfider what he fends us hereafter, before he tru/ls his MSS. to the poft. Jn the hurry of the paß week, an article of Polydore’s obtained admißiun inadvertently, which equally dif graced the Printer and his Paper. 7 he article alluded to, was given under the head of Mr. Baddeley, and contained itfinuiitions as illiberal and malignant, as the Printer knows them to be unjufl and untrue.

Mils RoifjNimf.
The ftiori time Mifs Rofnanzini has trod the EngHlh ftage, affords but little room to fpeak of her abilities, either as a finder or an aftrefs : in the firll {he is certainly the molt at home, though by care and attention we doubt not, but in time, {he will be found, in particular ebaradlers, a nfhFill find pleafmg a&refs. »
Mifs Romanytim’s focal powers are. far from great or of much extent; but, at the fame time, mu ft be allowed to poffefs a fweetnefs and melody, that mtift ever teiiSer them valuable and engaging; and if the poffeffor but refains from wantonly fporting with the higher notes,
iin order to imitate others) the reftriftion will be bund of much advantage, and the lady become what ihe is tapidly- riling into) a favourite with the publick.
The little charafter of Antonio, in the muiical Rseiance of Richard Ceeur de Lion, may be {aid to have firft tended to exhibit Mifs Romanzini, in a favourite point of view with the town ; the beautiful aii beginning with “ The merry dance I dearly love,” male's fuch an impreflioi. on the audience, from the limple and feeling manner in which Mils Romanxini fings the fame, that it never fails te receive a general encore.

Colley Cibber’s comedy of hhe would jW She 'would not was yeftereliy evening ■performed at tliis Theatre to a brilliant and, confidering the feverity of the weather and the holiday time-, to t numerous audience.
Mrs. Jordan’s performance of Hippolita needs Po encomium fiom the pen of the critick ; it \«»ts t ideed aimoft beyond paneryrick» Her debv iy cf the long was exquifite, and her aiding in the duel feme, was incomparably well. Mrs. Jordan’s f- cond drefs does her taile great credit ; it was elegance itfelf.
Up n the whole we never faw Mrs. Jordan SrefTed better, nr perform with mote fpirit and

Mrs. Wllfon played Flora very prettily, and Mifs Pope’sVilvtt t was extremely arch.
Snett’s Trappanti had much merit, and Bad-Scley’sUiort part of Sato was given with great truth and charafler.
The laughable Farce of The Devil to pay followed, and M'S. Jordan’s Nell, and Moody’s Jobfon ker>t the audience on a continual titter, ldannifter Juni ,r’s blind Fidler ought not to be forgotten ; it was admirable.
Mrs. Ward’s Lady Lçvrrule was fo excellent a piece of ailing, that we have no doubt (lie would play Catharine in Catharine and Petruchio admirably.

* Mr. Kemble’s departure from the other Macbeths in his manner of repeating “ to-morrow, to-morrow, and t )-morrow,” is one of the greatefl lingula ities of that very fiugular performer. In this inftance we do not, ncvertheltfs, intend to cal! his judgment in queftion, and we wifh he never excited the indignation of his criticks by any ab-, furdity mute glaring than this.	-
It it ouP.wifh, that the Witches, when thev next reply to Macbeth, “ a deed without a name,” would fo fpeak, that the audience may lie imprefled with the fublimity of the above paflage; and that Mr. Aickin, whofe ftyle of playing is certainly deferving of a better part than that of the pritiii-i pal Witch, be difmiffed from attending on the,duties of the Cauldion.
The method in which the array of Macbeth is now introduced upon the ftage in the beginning of the play, feems to have tak-n its rife from the judicious manoeuvres af Mr. Kemble, and it is but a pieeeof juft ice to that performer, to acknowledge it is attended with a plea flag effeâ.
Our attachment to comedy and opera in pre -ference to the heft produirons of the Tragick Mnfe, argues a mo ft unpardonable deficiency of tafte, and will, ere long, be evinced by the corruption of our manners.
Tire uproar, which enf red at Drury-lane Theatre. upon the la ft repnfemation of Macbeth, in eonfequence of the galleries calling upon the or-cheftra for the tune of “ God lave the King,” ohli red the performers to retire, the curtain to be again let down, and the gentlemen of the band, after much reluftance, to give it in perfection.
It is with concern we take notice, that fome of our bed p- tf 'rmers have got into a method or deftroyingthe f r.fe of a pafltge, by feparating too frequently the adjective from its fubftantive, and the v. rh from its friendly -oun, when common ftnf- poin'S out the connexion. This has been fometimei* dene, when the aftor has been making his exit, and when he has been exerting himfclf to give the laf1 word all the force he thought it de-ferv d: as • e hope this impe-feefion will be amended, we will not, upon ihis occafion, difeover their names.

THEATRICAL CHARACTERS No. XXIX.
Mr. R. Palmer.
WHENEVER the dawn of genius is difcover* able, it becomes the duty of an impartial writer, to nctice the objeit i > fuclra manner as may tend to forward, ard not deprefs it ; Mr. Robert Palmer has given us reafon to think from ftveral characters lie has recently apptated in, that lie is neither deftitute. of talent, geitt«** or judgment ; theugh at the flute time we mult confefs, that in t(Te performances alluded to, we have but too of;eu witutiled the muit drfgnltiflg fnibleJ thrown into each character ; one or two of which, we Aiail in-it.ance, in order to prove tve are neither influenced by ill nature or faihhood ; but, hcmpeiled to fpeafc the dictates of truth. Firlt, anJ principally* that we could wifn this Gentleman to avoid, is a mine-ing, frivolousj and inllgiiificant aCfoii, that fol-1 ovs, as if ir.ltin&ively, every charatter he iup-ports, and thereby weakens, i>- not totally takes away from the iutereft ami confequciice of each) and leaves as a fnbltitute, a dancing and aifeited lltadow. A rapid and hnauantiig utterance isalfo an ertor we cod’d with Mr. R. Palmer to dlfpepfe with ; his voice is naturally good, and dillinct, and if not variable in tone, is fcldom difcord.mt or grating on the ear, and ivonlj if properly nianaged, never be Ultpleafant or difgu!t.:—One fi.ult is at all times moll glaringly cotiipjcudt'3 in Mr. Palmer’s acting, which is now become by habit io general that our wonder is excited, if by chance, (which is feldom the cafe) the fume is not vifibW-a-ws m. an a wanton,an idle inattentivenefsto charafterand filua-tiou. The beautiful luminaries tliat nighty occupy the front and fide boxes, we readily allotv to pof-fefsa molt powerful attraffion ! but in making this allowance, we are led to imagine it is neither the wiflt of the channels in tjucftiun or thakof the audience t 'fufTer the entertainments of the evening to be diminilhed, merely to gratify the abfurd cu-riofity of theif entertainers.
Mr. R. Palmer as we have before cbf< rved, bids fair to arrive at a very rrfpeft hie height in his pro-fcffioh ; we have therefore tingled lit thofe errors that have hitherto Itood in the way of his advancement, and wh ch if weeded from the fruitful foil ef- his merits, mult tend-r re-appearance in inch parts, as Lord Minikin. Prompt, Jofeph Surface, Vane, DangF, Sir Harty Beagle, Sic. chirai’ar-iftick, decent, and uncenfuraUe. Having fecn this crurc’iau in fuch a line of characters, as above fluted, we cannot but hope, to fee hisuame, no more announced to appear in the nonfence of pantomimes, the abilities of the actor are above fuch a degradation, a.id which if cultured according to their value, mult place the pofiliTor in a lhort time in a light far above mediocrity.

The managers of the Oratorios at"Drury-lane, deferve prnife for keeping up the original prices, as a conceffion on this point would furuifh a triumph to the other theatre- The Coveri Garden Directors however are not behind hand in meriting approbation for the feleilion of their muiual pieces, and their vocal aud initrumental performers.

We can by no means approve of the ditricWn from Mrr.

This Tragedy's the produilion of the Hon. Elemy St. John (brother to the Earl ol Doling-1 roke) and was nceived with repeated ptoofs of i tie foiled approbation, by a molt brilliant ar.d crowded Theatre.
Mr. St. John has opened his tragedy with that e'lvtimltance of our hillory, which loon followed i ha refuge M-*ry fought in England, after the battle of Glafgow in the year lj68, viz her being detained at ‘Scroopw.houf'e by the orders of Eliza*
-1 . th. The other principal and mod marking evtnts that followed till the execution of Mary at Fother-mgay Catlle in 1587, foun the remaining incidents of this eventful play, rlcnce the padion th.e Duke of Norfolk entertained for Mary, his being arrelkd by tlie oidi.rs 1 f El zabetlphis having been forgiven by her; bis rets r<i with redoubled arih ur ts> the f.rviceof tlie Cutlet¡1 of Scots, till his fecond at-red, and execution, are among the confpicuaus f. a’urtsof this Drama. The niaflitcre of the Pro-fellairts in France is alfo introduced, and fuch other ! cirtumihuices as characterized this memorable period of our hid .ry. It is fearcely necefTavy for ns to add, that Mr. St. John lias taken the favourable tide of the qucRioii, in regard to Mi ry, and repre-iVnted her as a much injured Queen. To have treated the fubj-ft otherwife, v ould been to have differed widely from feme of our bed and moil credible hiilanan«, and to have given the incidents a turn unfavourable to dramatick intereft.
When the difficulty of working up and combining fuch a ferira of hiftorica^ fails into a tragedy is con fide red, and wl en it is liken ife confdered, that it required all the genius oi Shakcfpeare fo to decorate, heighten, and improve the important events that occurred in the letgns of cur Richards and Henrys, as to render them the fubjefts of in-terediug Dv-.tms, it mult be allowed, tlrat Mr. St. John has fucceeded in his Mary Queen of Scots, snuch better than could have been txpcfhd. The incidents are flnkingly placed in view, the characters of the times are itrongly marked and wtll-di fori ruinated, and although the play occationally dragged in reprefentatii n from want of more intereft, the prinrijiil fecnes p-oduce a fufficient portion of theatrical effect. The -denmumuit in parricidal ii better managed than the oihci parts of the conduit of the trai^lj, and imprefles the mind mull powerfully. Scents n prcfciiling important fails that (land recorded in the Annals of Euglifh Hiftory, naturally engage and intereft •our fadings, and prefervr our 'continued attention; dint that fort of attrafti m is dittinil from what is deiiouvn-ited dramatic inttr ft, which h excited rather by the “ cunning of the feene,” am! the de-prer of iu.nruity evinced by the Poet in his cond jiff of the pint, than by the fails themfelves, however important, however aff filing. For this renfon it is, that we wifh Mr. Saint John’s Tiagrdy, had more of dramarick inter.ft. We Ijink the puhli k greatly indebted to him, however, fir his having chofen an htftorical fubjeft, and f kited it from our own annals. The rmrefent-ing the important events that fwelltlie veil met of lliitilh hiilory in our Theatres, not only itifttuils the ignorant and uninformed in what they ought to be familiar with, but neceffarily impels thofe of an higher order to recover their loft time, and immediately fet down to make ihcmfelves complete mailers of an hillory, with every page and part of which, it is their indifpenlible duty to be conver-fant, and well read. Mr. St. Jihn, therefore, as far as the producing a lingle Historical Drama, will warrant the affertion, nw done his country a fervice; and fo did Banks, when he wrote his Ijband Qyrr'i, afterwards adted under the title of The Albion Queens.
The Jidtiivi of Mr. iit. John’s pi y was extremely unequal. The author feemed rather to have aimed at the fimple and the ptrfpicuous, than the poetical, the nervous, and the fublimc. Moll of Ins thoughts are juft, and fome of his fenli-metits dignified; hut the expreflion of both was, generally fpeakitig, .conveyed in fuch plain and familiar phraie, that the author appeared to have been afi aid of incurring the charge of affefta-tion, and of writing fuftian. Several of his metaphors were correct and pertinent, although we did not notice much originality of alhllion, nor much boldiufs of imagery.
To Mrs. SidJons the au her ib highly indebted. f>he played excellently upon the whole, and was wore free from the etri»r of fubftiviting a cosrfe ar.d vulgar llyle of action and attitude fi r dignified skportment, than we almofl ever witnefTed, where much is left to the pet firmer’» manner, and where that manner mult be fpirited. She had conceived the nsagnatihniiy of Maty’* mind judieioufly, and ■was peculiarly felicitous in expreffiug the heroifin of it. Herfenfibility alfo was more affecting thanufual. Several of the pafiage» file gave will» great dignity ;.nJ mail imprcflivr effect; in fine, lhe inflamed the character of the Queen of Scotr, with mo:e uni-f-rm fuperiuri'.y, than we, who (wit being pliant enough uniformly to fwir.t with the tide, or grow frantick with applaufe in compliment to the herd of indiferiminate approvers,^ admit always to have been the cafe, when the Theatre has been almoil rent with the roar of the mil judging multitude. Mr. Kemble, in Norfolk, dch-rved great praife. The character did nut afford {¡cope for much exhibition of fkill ; but at far as it did afford Rope, Mr. Kemble fuccefsfully fe'zed each opportunity cf difplx) ing >t; and wsfavarm and einp iflioiicd.
The end of the third a£t was the feiae fa which we allude. In the next ait he pl.iyed well, but Nor folk’s going to the fcaffold is fo nearly allied to Buckingham’s exit in Shakefpcar’s Henry the Eighth, that to an equal extent the fame fort of ailing has been feen. Mrs. \V ard played Elizabeth wi:h anobviousfegard to thecharaiterifti-k features of the queen’s mind, and as far as her voice would admit, ihs played ably. Mrs. Farmer delivered fe-veral of the fpeeches of Lady Douglas veiy affectingly. There is fomewhat peculiarly expreffive of feuhbility in her countenance, and of plr.intivencfs in her voiee ; but why does (hy.carry lur imitation of Mrs. Siddons to fo abfurd an extent, as to throw her arms about with, a wild extravagance, in fucli a cHaradtev as Lady Douglas ? Mrs. Sid-dons’s perfon is above the ordinary fixe, and the parts file plays frequently demand the difpliy of a more than female heroifin ; both, circtimflauces that lend an occafiona) grace to extravagance jbvit. where fenfibility and a gentle difpofition are the diftinguiihing features of a charadfer like Lady Douglas, the performer cannot be t^o governed in adtion. TendeVnefs neverdemands violence of ex-piefTtm; a melting foftnefs is its mofl eloquent language.—Whitfield and Wrooghlon did fulljullice to the litilepartsof Murray anti Lenox. The haugh tinefs of the Regent’s character was well hit off by the former, and Wroughton fpoke the fiugle fpeech of Lenox with great feeling.—Barrymore, Aickin, and Williams played their feveral parts 1 very refpeftahly—Phillimore contrived to give the Earl of Huntingdon’s charadter full blunt-nefs.—We pitied Jones, when the Honfe burft intoa roar of laughter, on his emphatically faying, Let us proceed. The fault was not Jones’s. The author mould have given him a fentence more emphatick to utter, or have padlocked his tongue.
In point of (tage afiiftance, perhaps there never was a tragedy performed in a theatre, which fpoke the great care and attention of the man ’gers more forcibly. The dreffes were not only in charadter, as nearly as Itage effect would admit, but thofe of the principal performers fph ndid almofl to a degree of wanton expence. Mrs. Sidifbns had two entire new drefles, and three feveral changes of appropriate decoration. Her firfl was a cl. fe Copy of the drefs of the unfortunate' Mary, as handed down to us by t^e tradition of the bell of thofe neceflary and almoft equally import nt liif-torians with thofe of the pea, the hiltorians of the pencil. As thefirlt painters of the time in which the Queen of Scots lived, have reprefented Mary, Mrs. 6iddon8 on Saturday appeared. When her misfortunes drew near their crifis, and (lie was confined in Fotheringay Caftle, her drefs was changed to a fuit of regal mourning, in ihefoun and ornaments of which the ftridteft attention was paid to the tale and fafhion of 1587. Upon the arrival of the noble Mtffengers of Blood, | (which hiftory dates to have beeft the Earl of Kent and othirs, and not the Earl of Shtewfbury)
(lie threw afide her mourning veil, and came forward with a beautud white veil, decorated with filver (tars, havjug at the fame lime a golden Agnus Dei, and- a Tofj*y pendant from her neck.
Ln h?r lull drefs hhc made a molt beantif. 1 ap-) pearance. Mr. Kemble’s drefa, in Norfolk, was extremely rich ail 1 elegant. "Mrs. Wartl,*Trom the propriety of her habiliments, the artificial rednefs of her hair, and the correit fhape of her niff, gave a very lively impreffnn of the h^ugucy, politick and unitable Elizabeth. There was fomething revolting, however, in the fliffturn ofher head, which, perhaps, was extremely proper in itfeF, anJonly appeared unpleafant from the more flimfy manners of modern times. Mr. Whitfield, Mr. Barrymore, and the other performers were alfo drefled with a due attention to charadter. In a word, all that conflitutes itage decoration, was ; in the belt llylr, highly to the credit of Mr. Kemble’s care and fcience, and to the Managers liberality.
The Prologue, we did not arrive at the theatre in time to hear, but, we underftand, it was a fo-ber but able preparation of the audience for the play, well delivered by Mr. Wroughton. The Epilogue Wis a motley performance. It contain«! a few ftidden (tarts of highly finiflied poetical thought and expreffion, mixed with fome profaick lines, and falfe points. Fo,r the fake of futprizing the audience into an Inj idtcious laugh, the following lines were introduced :
Learning and Wit were once eSeemed, and then
Een Johr.fon had his day—’tit now Big Ben.
Shaktfpeare mike room for Humphriei! that’athe way To hrin* your Blen of Ftjhion to the pliy.
Perhaps there never was a more inapplicable attempt at fatire. Pantomimes have received the fanition of ages, and Humphries, Mendoza, acd the other pugilifts (lately feen on Covent Garden itage) were introduced in an approved pantomime, to make room for which, neither any one produflion of Shakefpesre or Johnfon, nor even of the maudlin dramatifts of modern times , was fet afide. Nor were they brought forward to draw the men of fafhion to the play, but merely j to gratify the galleries. Men of fafliion, who are nst naturally men of good talle, and pofiefTed of an elegant mind, are no more to be beaten into rational propenfities, than reafoned out of their, follies; nature will prevail—and, as a blockhead born is not lefs a blockhead, becaufe he happens to have a title, and wear an embroidered coat, it is the worft of all poflible compliments to the beau monJc, to fuppofe that the exhibition of a bruifing match will draw them to the Theatre, when the genius of Shakefpeare, and the learned L b*ur of Ben Jonfon, cannot attraft their attention.
Mrs. Siddcns fpoke the Epilogue better than we ever heard her fpeak any compolition of flippancy before.
Mrs. Billington’s Yarico attracted a very crowded audience,011 Saturday evening, toCovent Garden Theatre, and gained great ap; l.iufe.
We hear that Mr. Byrne, of Covent G rden Theatre, has received a very hamlfome congratu-litory letter from the French Ballet Mailer, who got up the Ballet on Captain Cook’s Death, acknowledging the fat is fact ¡on he feels on hearing how well-the Ballet has been prepared fortke puhl ck, and the Uelerved reception it Las met with \ froiii a Bijtilh atidieiHC.	,

AuuodC ïS ° f _ THEATRICAL CHARACTERS’ No. XXXI. •
Mr. L A M A & H.
THE talents of this performer may be rendered extremely uftful to the ftage j his figure is good, his delivery unexceptionable, and when per-fonifying fuch characters as valets and coxcombs, may be deemed a pleafant and agreeable comedian.
When it fo happens that Mr. Lamafh is theatrically dignified, the affirmed confequence fits aukward upon him ; for however wtll the aclor may be dreffe;*, the low and affected conceit of the menial continually glares in the manners rf the Lord, who, thus nietamorphofed, advances, recedes, and cuts as many capers in the courfe of a minute, as a fribbling dancing-mailer in the hurry of momentous duty.
We are, however, of opinion, that Mr. Larnnih might be employed much oftener in his pri.feffinn than is really the cafe, as he undoubtedly poffeffes abilities fuperior to many who reprefint characters, that in right belong to him. We are well aware of the difficulty in calling parts according to the merits of thofe who are to fullain them ; but in making this allowance, are obliged to acknowledge thqt, private partiality and prejudice too frequently have weight with adding nvina rers ; and the refult arifing from fuch oetty diltinfrtions, often tends to the injury of authors, thepubliek, and the intereil of managers thsmfelves.

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
The dramatic Romance of CYMON, with alterations was performed for the firft time by the Drury-feme Company, at the Haymaiket Theatre, on Saturday evening, when the characters were thus reprcfented:	.
Merlin, Mr. Bannifitr,
Cymgw, Mr. Kelly,
Derm, Mr. Parfons,
Linen, Mr. Bannifter, Jan.
Demur;, Mr. Dignunr,
Dorilas, Mr. Cook,
Cupid, Mailer Greiglon,
Drtvron nf Feren^e, Mr. Sedgwick.
Urgar.dj, Mr«. Crouch,
Sylvia, Mifs Hagley,
Fatima, Mrs. Jordan,
Firji Shephar defs, Mifs De Camp,
Second Saephcrdefs, Mrs. Bland,
‘ Dorcas, Mr. Suett.
Fairies, Lovers, Spirits, Shepherds, &c.
Kmghts, and numerous Charaiters in the Proceffion and Tournament.
Scene, Arcadia.
The dramatic Romance of CYMON has generally been confidered from the day of its firft production, under the immediate infpe&ion of its author, (the late David Garrick)', to the pre'fent hour, as an exhibition more ihewy than interell-ing, more tending to furprife the ienfes than inform and amufe the tlnderftanding. Its original muGck wa* a ijjafsof dullnefs, occafionally relieved by fomc-of the moil beautiful airsthat ever were penned by a compofer, with a few choruffes imagined with greatnefs of conception and executed with a correfponding felicity and force of expreffion. In his literary eflbits the author had overlaid the natural.fimplrcity of his fable, and in the mufical part the compofer had copied the author’s fault fo far as to lefien, if not deftroy the eileft of his own taile and talents. MaUrlem fuperabat opus was therefore its true character, and having long fo con-fhiered i’, we were not a little fuiprifed to Jearn that it was reviving at a great cxpence at the Hay-market Theatre. That k was coming forward with alterations was known, but when we recollected how difficult it is to lift literary lumber of the dramatic fpecies, when weighed down and pinned to the ground, as it were, hv ponderous mufick, we defpaired of feeing the Romance fufficicntly cured of its defedts»_to be worth the exi mce that it was generally under ¡tond was about to be beftow-cri upon it. On Saturday evening, however, alt who thought with us, were agreeably difappointed,-aod though we can never perhaps be taught to think CYMON, under ail poffiblc improvement, capable of being entitled to be coniidered as a cbej-iToirure, it iruft be acknowledged that in con-hquence of fome aiaterial mufical alterations, added to one of the moil magnificent and fplendid JpcSacIes that ever the ftage exhibited, CYMON ftands in its prefent (late of reprefentation entitled to a much greater ihare of praife, than we bad imagined it evir could be wan anted to claim; The. audience of Saturday applauded it loudly in its projrrefs as a performance, and were in raptures wifh ihe proceiTua of the Knights of Chivalry and the fnbfcouent Tournament.	.
The. order and uharadters, that formed the pro ceffion, were as follow:
Four Herald?, two by two.

The alterations in the Romance itfelfare chiefly mufical, and confift o£ Ducts and Trios by Sto-lace, Airs and a Rondeau by the fame compofer, And a Trio by Linley. Thefe are ail of them of great but different degrees of merit, and tend to communicate a (hare oflightnefsand variety to the performance, which it much wanted. In the Trios, both Storace aud Linley have been Angularly fuc-cefsful.-	,	_	. _
A procefiion of the Knights In the dreffes of the warriors and different orders of chivalry in former times, particularly the Anglo Saxons, Danes, and thofe -of England, France, and Norway, was introduced at the termination of the action of the Romance. To thefe were added a grand car, with the figures of St. George and the Diagon, another with Cupid heating a filver arrow, and rhe whole accompaaied with the Duke of York’s Band. The proceflion ended, a tournament took place of both hotfe and foot, between feveral combatants in armour, who fought with lances, lpears, fwnrds, and ba tie-axes ; three living horfes are introduced, and managed with much dexterity. The Prince of Wales’s Highlander made one of the cavalcade, and entered the lids as a champion, fighting with an enormous club; againft him an Amazon of¡¡elite iiae was oppoied,by ’»hole agility and adroitaefs, the Giant is fubdued.
TW Proceflionand Tournament malt neceffarily have coft an enormous ium, and certainly exceed all former inftanccs of pageantry and (hew that lit times fo fired with a rage for fpeSacle as the pre-
fent, human ingenuity has contrived. Sofplendid
an exhibition as this is, and an exhibition conr-pofed of fuch a number of performer», »11 of whom have material feparate aelion, refpeflivcly allotted to them, was perhaps never before arranged with fo well ordered a method, or executed with a better, more regular, or a more (Inking effect. The horfes themfelvvs pranced and paced theatrically, Mid one of them (hewed how much mote clumfy an animal his rider was than himfelf.	,
The Performers did themfelves great credit, and kindly proved, that where the Theatre had a great point to carry, it cxuld not fail of fuccefs, from the want of their bell efforts to fupport it. The characters of this dramatic Romance were all well fudained, Mifs Hagley, who, from the mere con-fequence of accident performed the part of Sylvia, may blefs the hour that threw it in her way. The public could not olhei wife have imagined how much (he reflects credit on her mailer, Mr. Linley, and hew infinitely (lie is improved as a Singer and Comedian. Her Air of “ Sweet Paffion of Love” was charmingly given, and mod defervedly encored. Mrs. Crouch was, as (he has been uniformly this feafon, vaftly beyond her own par. She fung tnolt admirably the whole evening, efpecially in Storace’s compofuipas. Mrs. Jordan’s Fatima was whimfically pleafant, and could we forget Mrs. Abifigtou in the character, we ihauld pronounce 1 her. greatly fuccefanH ; bift her Fatima though '
conceived, and lent a grace to (us lublequcnt animation and fpirit, when cured of his (implicit)' and ignorance.	_
Mr. Bannifter, by his emphatical and exprefiive delivery of the words, as well as his able-and (kilful manner of giving the fongs of Merlin, proved that the Managers had not made a b d market in their engagement with him*. Jack Banniller kept up hisfpiritsiu Linco, and as he ever does, contributed much to the good humour and pleafantry of the audience. Suett’s Dorcas was one of his bed performances, and ferved, from its chadenefs, happily to heighten the dronger coloured chaiaCter of Dorns from the pencil of Parfons.
Mifs DeCamp and Mrs. Bland did every thing in their refpedtive parts that could pofiibly be at-chieved, and Dignum, we are convinced, would have done more, if he had been gratified with better opportunity.	_
The Duke of York’s band, by their afitflance, added conliderably to the mufical effedl of the exhibition bf the fpeftacle, and the Giant of the Burning Mountain may be confidered as no /mail indrumeot in fupport of the (hew of the Tournament.	_
Such of the feenery as was new, was beautiful and becoming Urganda's magiek. The two gardens did honour to Mr. (greenwood’s (kill. The dreffes were extremely rich and elegant. Thofe of Mrs. Crouch, and Sylvia were oppofed with great tafte and propriety. The overture was grand and well adapted to the fubjedt.
We cannot clofe our Article, without noticing a circumdance fo aufpicious tc* the future intereds of the Drama, as the kind attention manifefted by a perfonage of the highefl rank, in the getting up of the dramatic Romance of CYMON, to whofe fnperior talle, we have no doubt the publick (land indebted, for its prefent fplendid (late of exhibition. His Royal Highnefs Frederick Prince of Wales dood forward as the friend of Thomfon, the celebrated Author of the Seafons, and of Tancr*d and Sigifmunda, and on every oc-cafion didinguiihed himfelf as the Patron of Genius and Talents, wliich threw a la ire round his cha-rader, that added much to its fplendour and dig* nity. That his lineal fucceffor will follow deps io honourable to himfelf, fo liberal to the Aits, and fo advantageous to the Publfck, every day gives forr new promife, and that promife uniformly rife? into reality.	,
CYMON, with its alterations and magnificent addtnda, can fcarcely fail to repay the managers amply for thj bold rifque they have hazarded in venturing more largely than theatrical precedent has yet warranted.
• In Caliban we had not the pleafure of feeing Mr. Bannifter laft Tucfdar, but judice requires we Ihould declare, that h« is the only performer, whoever fatisfadtorily conveyed to our minds a fit idea of Shakcfpcare’a meaning, when lie imagined fo bold, and yet, allowing the probability of its exitlence, corrcfpondently drawn a charaSer.

The Young Lady who attempts to come forward at the Haymarket Theatre this evening, as the Heroine of her own Tragedy, is peihaps more t peculiarly entitled to thejiberality and kinduefsof the audience, than any former Candidate for then favour. After a week’s confinement with a fey ere hoarfenefs and cold, willing to accommodate the convenience of the Theatre, not daring to trifle with the patience of the pubfick, and anxious to convince them, that ihe would rifque every thing that regmdsher own fame, rather than iircur their difplea uirr, (he ventures, although unwell, to appear befote them, and to attempt all that her powers will permit, to prove her fincere wiflrti to he found worthy of that generous proteflton, which has ever been the dittinguifhing . charatierillick of a Britiih audience.	.
TJjis Tragedy L the produftion,x)f Mifs Hannah Brand, a naiiveand inhabitant of Norwich, highly . refpefted as a woman of irreproachable character and uncommon literary talents, by all who have the pkafyrcof her acquaintance. A Novice in the prait'ce of writing for the ftage, it is not to be wondered at that duller authors* more familiar with thejeu de 7'hca‘re would have avoided errors that are obvious hi the cortitrqclioa of the play. The lcenes are fame of them much too long, more of the working of the plot is brought iute the aftion of the fccae and lefs thrown into defcription than Ihruld have been the cak, and the character» are fo abundant that it demands (as the call of the play evinces) fuch a number of performers that fcarcely any modem EngHih Theatre can well feleft ferrous actors enough for reprefentatives of the Dramatit Ptrfmc of aTragedy at this day, when Mr. Sheridan by Iris powerful ridicule exhibited through the medium of the Cxittcx has almoit laughed alf Tra-geyly off the ftage. In other refpeds this play is eminently entitled to praife. It poffeiTes intc-.££&. creates a proper portion of fuipenfe and car. rics it on naturally, and gradually. It is conducted 1 with art and ingenuity but not by any circumftances I revolting to probability. The characters aie drawn j aaddi&nainated with a mafterly liand, the page of ’ hiftory in all the main incidents is religioriiy obfetr-ed, and the circumfrances of The Siege of Belgrade (for that would have been its title had it not*have been pre-occupied) are baldly and ftiLkiugly pour-•rayed. ’Above all, the language, though fuffici-ently poetical, is vigorouily plain and remarkablv perfprcuous. The fp echos of the Old Oificer, and fome of thofe of Agmuuda are undeniable-proofs of the verity of this affertion.
As a firft produ¿don, Huniades is a Tragedy which reflects credit on its Author, who, as fhe acquires more knowledge of the praftical ufeof the ftage, will doubtlefs advantage herfelf of h£.r »^proved experience and aim more at ftage eftya. Yefterday evening the four firft ads were received with great apaiaufe, but the fifth, from its extreme lengrh, the imperfeftnrfs of fome of the performers, and the hoarfenefs of the Author, which occafionally gave her voice a roughnefs of tone (that by no means naturally belongs to it, for it is of ,tlfU* ^hcn unhurt by a cold, clear, au lib’e and more than ordinarily powerful) and from other unfortunate circumftances did not prove equally fuc-cefjful, but provoked fome tefiftance. and whin he 1 ragedy was announced for reprefentation to-mon-mv evening, there was a confide.able degree . ^.approbation, mingled with the oppofing u *e majom>'’ The Author will, doubt^

r Utyftes, and if fo new an archer as a young C5Ty, who never before attempted to touch a ftage bow, could not always bend it adroitly and powerfully, (he may well be deemed guilty only of a very venial fault. In the fecond aft the young Lady fpoke fenfibly and diftmftly, but not loud enough for the ftage of fo large a theatre. In the third (he exerted herfelf more fuccefsfully, often- delivered her fpeeches with great dignity and effeft, and .*as honoured with much applaufe by a mod Crowded audience. In the fourth (he kept polltf-fion of her place in the general eftimation, bnt in the fifth (he became extremely hoarfe, and that fatal circumftance to a fifth aft of a tragedy, the rifibility of the audience having been provoked by fome aukward and ludicrous execution of the ftage bufinefs, that fort of general murmur prevailed, that rendered it impoflible for her to be heard diftinftly, which added to the too great length of her dying feene, furniftted caufe for the difpleafure which fome of the audience manifefted. Her action and department (as the aftion of every ftage novice »111 be) were rather redundant, and fome-times ungracefbl; but occafionably both irillanced elegance and produced effeft. In the management of her perfon in the third aft, when flle uttered the word “ my ¡elf,” nothing could be more happy ot" rtore dignified. Her conception of the character throughout was evidently precifely correftj htr execution not always adequate to it. Want of j ufe to publick delivery will, with every liberal and | candid mind, fufilciently plead her excufe. j The other parts were powerfully call and ably performed. Mr. Kemble, Mr. Wroughton, Mr. Aickin, Mr. Whitfield, and Mr. Packer are eminently entitled to the Author's thanks for their exertions,and Mr. Barrymore in a ftiil more particu-lar.degree, fince in confequence of Mr. Bentley's iud-den and fevere illnefs, he undertook to ftudy the character of Count Celley at a day’s notice. Mr. Palmer {flayed Mahomet ably, but he would have much afilfted the general effeft of the Tragedy had he been more petfeft. Mr. Benfon, Mifs Collins and every other performer merit acknowledgment for their zeal in the fopport of parts effential to the play, bnt not calcola-e i to enable thofe who exer-cile the pro (Villon peculiar to the ftage to difplay thfeir t ilents to much advantage.
The dreftes were rich and appropriate. That of the Heroine n t lupetb enough ; and that of Huniades, though proper to the charafter, was feen in a moment, when the audience being dif-pofed to titter, the effeft was rather ludicrous than felicitoufly impreflive.
The Prologue was written as an invocation to M ercy for Mifs Brand, who in her extremely new fituaiion threw hetfelf on the candour and generality of the audience. What it might want in grace and effect as a compofition, it derived from the ability and (kill of Mifs Fairen, who pleaded angcl-tongued our Authoi’s caufe.
Mr. Bannifter, Junr. fpoke the Epilogue, which began in the chaiadler of a Norfolk Ploughman, addieffing the audience in his Sunday’s clothes. The provincial dialeft was given by Mr. Ba-.niiller with his wonted force and humour, and r.o performer on the ftage, except himfelf, could perhaps fo na urally aud fo powerfully have given ine feri-ous line* which form the conclufion of the Epilogue. Both Prologue and Epilogue C3me from the pen of the Author of the Tragedy.

-7	^ ^	■ i ^	,
On Saturday evening Mrs. Siidons appeared iOr the firft time on the ftage of the Haymsrket Theatre, and playrd the ebarafter of Ifabella in Southern e’s Fat A Marriage with all her wonted fuecefs. Mrs. Siddons, though much thinner than when we h-ft law her, is not a worfe figure, and peihaps never aited this part with more exquifite tafte, better judgment or greater effeft than on Saturday. Her management of what in ordirifcty hands would be Ca'led the little things cf the feene was admirable ; moil efpecially in her conduit of the few words ¡he had to fay previous to her quit- . ting the itage at the end of the third ait. At her exit in the fourth ait, where file leaves Biion, her grief boiled over, and the expreflion was rather ludicrous, which blurred the grace of the feene. Kemble, whofe Biron, generally fpeaking, was made the moil of, fet her the example by his “ thou, thou, thou>” which ¡¡ meant as a new reading, fhould be difearded as a moil abiurd one. Palmer played Villetoy ably, but furely his wedding coat,&c. might have been of a gayer colour. He feemed to hive drilled nimfelf for ¿iron’s funeral, rather than for Isabella's marriage. We cannot dole this article without ob-ferving that the voice of Mrs. Siddons, at the heft not powerful, is a great (offerer in this extenfive Theatre, and that her expreffion of countenance (and (he has hitherto been remarkably fuccefs-fiil in the command of her features) is wholly loft. Her diefs was uncommonly neat and elegant without the (mailed attempt at finery—a ftinng proof of an improved judgement iu the weaier.
The Editor of a daily Paper having thought proper to affert that Brand is not the real but the a flamed name of the young Lady, author of the new tragedy called Huniades, we beg leave to undeceive the publick in that particular, and to acquaint them that Mifs Hannah Brand, writer of the play, and who ventured to hazard her fame by attempting the principal character in her own Tragedy, is the younger fitter of the Rev. John Fitz Brand, who has fonie church preferment, and is Chaplain to the 34th regiment, (his Majefty’s own regiment) of dragoons. Mifs Brand is at prefent employed in altering her tragedy, in order to compreis it, and remove the few paiTages in the fifth aéi, at which feme of the audience exprefled tokens of diiapprobation.
Thus much may be anticipated of the new Opera in preparation at Covent Garden.—That, in point of Lnguage, eveiy line is ftamped with the mark of poetical talents. Senfe is not facri-£ced to found, nor gramma'- obliged to yield its good (ènte to the dictates of the gamut. To fay that it mull fucceed, would He arrogating too much—but to hint that it defeives fuccefs, is no more than what it merits. This little tributary anticipation is teat to the pretti by one who has heard the Opera read, commented upon by thofe who are judges, and approved of very highly by all who were prefent.	.	‘

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE. Yefterday evening CYMON, (whole magical force exceeds lhat of*Urgand«’s art greatly) was ' performed for the niF.etcenth time, and under the difadvar.'age, for the feta id time felt, of Wanting, the powerful affillSnce , f Mrs. Crunch s vocal excellence, to a molt large and brilliant audience. Mrs. P--well was again obliged to lead the part of Urganda, which (he reads ..ell, and herd with df-fetved applaufe ; but furely the public ought not to be napped info a deceit t Mrs. Goodall played the charaftgr of Fatirra, and played it with great cafey burr,oar and elicit. The Romance anj us w.nRferful pr refit n, fa a moil wonderful fptlaclt it certainly is, were received w ith that warmth tf applaufe tb it undeniably indicates a continuance of celebrity to the reprefenta ion. Wei! knowing tnw much the public re», ret the aLfcuce t.4 » perfcr.rer, f<’ jotlly-their fjv .uiite as hi s. Crouch is, we are happy to announce, that fue is on her recovery, a d in Tt pro!-ability v.ill be able to wave the wand of U>-ganda on Monday evet.irtg.

THEATRICAL ARTICLES.
The qu-nlcm HUNIADES is coming forward again under a new till } and very conftdrrably altered, in order to obviate every one of the few oh-'eflions offered agrinil the play on the fit ft night of lepiefeination. The author, though-confined by illnefs ever fince her debut, has not idled away her lime; the improvement of her tragedy has occupied her attention, and employed the whole of hut lei-fure. Every poffible provilion has been made to lefien the length of the performance; the fifth aft will come forward under the operation of a complete change as to tke conduft of the catailruphe* and a new Epilogue will be fpeken by Mclfis. Snett and Bamtifter.—We fcarcely remember that the four Gift z£ts of ary tragedy weie mere fa-v UTably received than thofe of Hux jades; and finely, when 1.) extraordinary a circumftance as tlio Gift venture oa the boards of a young Ludy, who was author of the play, is tak. 11 into the conG-deration of the candid, however the interfiled and the envious may wifh otherwife, and endeavour, by every ft older art, to cany theii in lirecl putpofe, it will be generally admitted that fuch honed and powerful claim, to fair fame meric encouragement rattier than repulfon.
Cymom has done more for the Hay-market Theatie, than any one Piece, whether till.Gcal, t-agick, rr comick ; or whether fupported by all the aid of Lag and fosguets, pathos and acting, vis tomica, or laughing pkaiantry, Ncitbir Crouch, nor Storace, nor Kelly ; n;r Siddony, fior Kemble; nor Fairen, nor Jordan, nor Jack Banciiler, have ever drawn fo much money, when individually con-ftdered, as the dull, but dulcet, nonfenfe of Cy-rr.on, bolllered up by the a!l-attraftive power* of pageatitry 3rui fhew, exerted fo as to be original in aim, and uarxarop'ed in execution.
The Day in Toasty has proved the fnurce of many nights entertainment in London : whether it will equal the „umber of the Arabian Night* Entertainment or not, next feafin may evince. If leport raav be credited, Mr Merry’s M.rgiwaa .promifes to lbew, that bis fpclls are irrelill.'ult.

Mifs EeakD and Utr T&aCECV redeemed !
1Vhe»t a laugh is railed agafuft fceues, intended to product a feriqus effeft, whether by the accidental cireumftanccs of lepicfeutation, or the error of the author, theconfequer.ee is generally fatal to the Play, becaufe it i, more natural fbi mankind t© be prone to laugh than to'cry; and if they arc called on to be fad, the fmalleft provocation to mirth is pretty fure to prove fucceisful. In the courfe of the reprefentatiqn of the Tragedy of H U N l A D £ S laft Wednefday fortnight, the author had given little poiltble opportunity for liability to attach upon the performance, but in the acting, ample food for laughter prefented jtfelf to an audicuce, whofe patience was tired out by the too great length of the feenes, and who were thereby prepared to relieve thernfelves, by the firft oppor unity, to relax their mufclel, that ihoutd offer. Unluckily for the author, Mr. Pah mer was imperfect throughout the fourth aft, acir-cumftauce which dangcroufly disjointed the intereft of the play. In the fifth, it was evident that the heroine had fallen hoarfe (another untoward circumftance!) The followers of Mahomet, in their threat to-kill their matter fooner than fuffer him to fall a captive, talked rank nonfenfe (a third difafter!) audio the aft of forcing hitn away, it was not ¡a the power of Heraclitus him-felf to hare kept his countenance ; but when Mr Kemble came on in his fable fuit of fatar.ic. ar-mo.tr, and looked lo greatly grim, Diogenes and all his dilcontented difciples could not haves appeared four ; the fugat had. taken full pollefiion of the punch, and ttagedy was turned into farce, downright bioad laughable farce ! The audience were entertained, and the author was left to all appearance damned.
Such was the fate of Husiades, a fate which fate itfelf (to uie ihe Stage Blafphenry) appeared fcarcely likely to redeem, but cool, deliberate re-fleftion taught her friends, that a Lady {who was capable of producing filch a corapofilion at the Tragedy Called Ilumiadcs, in which, amidft great errors iu point of mifeonftruftion and mifconduA of plot (arifing merely from a want of knowledge of the jeu de Theatre) there is as much power of writing, a3 much ftrength of compofition, and vigorous fimplicity of language as any modem play can boaft) ought not to be left a. facrifice to »be accidental ridicule of the moment, but that feme effon fhould be made to reftore her to her merited tank as an author. Hence the fe-cond .appearance of her Tragedy laft night. She fell experimentally the forcc yf cuftotn, and to redeem her fame, liftened to all that her, friends faid on the fuh), ft of popular prejudi-1 ces, and the neceflity of bending to them. 1 W ith a manly fpirit (he fubmitted to the fuigieal eperatiens of the occafion, cut tailed and altered her piece, fo as not only to obviate, but abfo. lutely to defy the Force oF ridicule, and the fuccefs ihe lalt night experienced, has fufficicntly proved that (lie has acted wifdy and well. AGMUNDA yettetday evening came forward in a cold atmof-phere,b«it under a genial iky. The audience was not numerous, but it was genteel, generous, and juft. They liftened with attention, they heard with candour, and they applauded with liberality. In -^e rri*edr> improved greatly as to’ftage effect iu coiifequence of the alterations, not only was re5i*'^d without a muimur of difapp obation, but with nrohf mar ks of genuine aoulaufe. The eon. t I u'1C I,rt fcene* ,lm °f ‘he death of Agmun-“•’hasbeen changed from one extreme to the other, and trill requires amendment. It «as on the firft
rcDreientation ot HUMADJiS, too lingering anJ tedious. It was laft night too hafly and abrupt. This defect a drop of ink will do away.
Mifs Brand exerted herfclf, and fnccçfsfully to merit the favour of her audience. Though labouring under the heavy drawback of a fevere cold, ihe wa» heard with diftinftuefs, and convinced all pielcnt, that (he could not only fpeak intelligibly, but with imprellive force and energy, j
it is a hard fate, when a lady, who aiming only at aving her literary compofittons produced on the Stage of a London Theatre, cannot find her way to the public, though the medium of onr firft Aftrcfles, and is refuted admrflton to the Temple of Fame, owing to the caprice, the arbitrary will, or the wanton exercife of power in the Managers or the principal perfotmeis, and at laft finds her-iclf compelled either to abandon the honeft (take ihe plays for, and lofe light of the reward that might follow the labours her talents have diftated, or rafhiy to brave the danger of the effort, and by venturing to ftep upon the ftage, play her principal charafte', and expofe herielf to all the ridicule and ribaldry that ipay make op the confequence. Mifs* Brand, were (he profeffi.inaily an riitrefs, or did (he come before the Publick io that point of view, would be a juft objeft of fev:re criticifm. It would then be fair to talk, of her provincial dialect, her ungraceful action, and her un man aged deportment, but for the fake uf common-liberality, let us treat a female, comiag forward under eifeum-Itancesal.ogether new, a.i3 perfectly unprecedented, with fomething like a due degree of .delicacy and refpeft.
Mr. BecCey yefterday refumed the chaiafter of Count Celiey, whirl) he played uncommonly Weil ; he threw an air of dignity and importartce'into it, which thofc, who have atrended every Rchear-Cal of the Play, had fcarcely thought it in the power of acting to grace it with. Mr. Palmer was perfeft, and looked and fpake, and moved like Mahomet. The Characters, were feveral of them new dreffed ; in particular, Campcftran, who, on the firft reprefentation, inftead of reminding the Audience of the Leader of a Ciufade, at. the head of 40,000 Troops under his own command (as Hiitory Hates) refembied “ A bare-footed Brother of our Order.” Inlhott, the whole ftyls of the ¡performance vefterday evening gave the idea that the fupreme Director of the Theatre was expected to be prelcnt, ?nj that he thoold not fee a theatrical exhibition brought iorw4cd on his own itage, under erreumttances fo fcandaloufly dif-jrraceful to the Theatre, as that of Jfuttiidei laft Wednefday fortnight, but more tf this hereafter.
Mifs Farren deferves ill tl—*- yuailc c.;i L..I.-rr^ lor lier more tli vrGfterly kindueis in Jo nobly aid in'v a female. al .O 'cther unknown to her, by chear-. tmir ner«eg cn»« « aorerte taorarnt, ttm whfn with X«« ihew of tesfon a capital »ftrefs tike herielf might leave withdrawn her alUiUaCt, to fpeak. the Prologue, winch Ihc gave with molt perfu-five elabueuce.
The Epilogue was » new one, hut wot felicitous in eft«ft. Suett, as an undertaker, came on, ex-pedling that Agmunda was dead, and muft be burieth Mr. Brnnifter, junior, an honttl tar, had (as the fiftion ftated) broken the under aker » head, for Grfpefting. that becaufe Agmuoda fainted, (he muft be fit for funeral ; he thdtefore raHtes the undertaker for hia over hade to gel a job, and fwears that he would brave all danger to lave a woman in dtft.efs, md land her fafe on ihore-

ring's Sheathe, mat market,
Cymon and his knights were again brought forward yefterday evening. The only nofelty, how*, ever, Was Mrs. Crouch’s refuming the part of Ur-ganda. Pleafed as we mull ever be to fee and heaf her; we are much afraid that her real for performing her theatrical duty, has on this occafion rather outrun her prudence. Her appearance but too evidently pointed out that her late indifpofition had been a fevere one. She looked, as Ihe ever rnnfl, moft beautifully, but fire is certainly rather thinner; and though Ihe exerted herfclf fo as to lender it fcarcely perceptible, Ihe Hill retains fotne degree of her hoarfenefs j infomuch that (he Was obliged to omit a beautiful Rondeau in the third acl. Her diefs was new, elegant and chn-rafteriftic. The other characters were ably fuf-tained. Kelly-, in particular, never was in better voice. If it were neceflary for M s. Crouch at this day to be told how great a favourite ¡he is with the public, the falhioiiable and overflowing houie that attended yeilerday muft molt decidedly •onviace ber of it.
_ 72^- <fl ! J CfL Drury-Lane.
The theatrical novelty of this Houfe, laft night, was the appearance of Mrs. St boons, for the firft time, as the Queen, in the Tragedy of Ric hard the Third. To fay that this great aftrefs did ample Juftice to the charafter, would'be'faying no more than (he deferves ; but it mull .be faid alio, that the part is far below the- rate of. ber talents, and prefented little of importance. Kemble was, as ufual, critical and forcible, in the favage hero of the piece. Who affigned the part of Ludy Anne to Mifs Collins, we know not; but we hope, for her Own credit, ihe will not be induced to af-fume it any more. The Houfe was .very well attended.	.	~	' '
THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
Yefterday evening Mr. Kemble gave a notable Tamplt of his policy aB a Manager, and his powers as an acl rf. He fnffered his filler to fink into the character of the Queen in Richard he Third, in order that his own impoitance in the chara&er of Glotler might be fu'tained. Sncb a confelfion of vanity, egregious bevond all compatifon, and fo glaring an inftanee of tolly, we never before vrttneffed. Does Mr. Kemble ftragme, that fbe Theatre is fo befotted as to con-f nt tn pay his lifter the large fum ihe draws from the Tre*fi»ty every night of her performance, merely to make him pafs in the eyes of the publick for a great adtor ?
Mrs. Siddo'.s, we need fcarcely fay, gave the little part of the Queen infinite importance. She played admirably. Mifs Collins, acomie aft-efs.was calt the part of Lady Anne, and did all Ihe could to maintain the decent dignity of the character.

The perfiarmante at this houfc tail uightj was The Messiah, one of the molt fnbliine compofi-tions of HandeLi It was opened by Kelly, in i bold dnd impredive ftyle. His “ Comfort ye my people,” and “ Every valley,” were highly interefting. Among the other merits of the per* formance mutl be noticed the exeitions *if Mrs. Crouch, Mi is Hag ley, Mi's. Bland, and particularly Mailer Walsh, who poffeffes a ▼cry fine voice, with ilrong indications of talle and genius. The perfon cf Mils Barclay is very plcafing, and, with mote pra£lice, (he will doubtleis prove a ufcfulpeifurmer. Y oungBuiDCE-towfr played a Violin Concerto in a wonderful ttyle for fo infantile a mutician. The audience am-muted to a coniiderablt number, though Mattered about the theatre.
Covent-Garden.
The talents employed in the Oratorios at this Theatre are of the firlt kind, aud the effeft is proportionate The entertainment of laft night was a judicious feleftinn fiom the (lores of Handel, in every refpefl admirably fuftained. Harrison and Mrs. Billington conftltute an holl of vocal ability, and they drew forth their utmoil powers. The grand chorus, “ He gave them hail ftones,” was encored, and the audience endeavoured to get other parts repeated, but a fenfe of the fevere labour n ceflary to the general performance overcame the felfiih impulfe. I he Band was well led by Young Ashley, and the ChotufTes went off with a fpirit and accuracy worthy of the immortal comp iler.

The play was interrupted on Saturday night, For upwards of Joalf are hour, by a party of ■vagrants, ftationed in feveral parts of the houfe, to clamour for the air of Ca ira. As this is the fecond time that the audience of this Houfe has been difturbed by iimilar enormities, we have only to fay, that the public' have a right to expefl that the M a n a c e rs will prevent a repetition, by cauling the offenders to be apprehended. They can do this legally, be-caufe they are not obliged to deviate from the bill of fare they Publiih upon any account. That thefe rioters came to the Theatre on purpofc to breed difturbance, cannot admit of a doubt—who, but a brute hired by money would have thought of calling for that or any hallaid-air, when Mrs. Siphons was about-to perform Isabella l

The feleftion x>f harmonic merit at this place on Fridgy laft, was admirable, and was performed in a ftyle truly capital. We have not room to be particular,. and therefore fhall only obferve, that among the more confpicuous excellencies, were to be claimed’thtf efforts of little Walsh, Kelly, Mrs. Crouch, and' Morjlli. Walsh’s
Thou (halt not leave his foul In Hell,” was highly, beautiful. " KellY’s Recitative and Air from- jeptha, were delervedly admired. Mrs. CRpu.y fi gave in-fo charming a ftvle “ As from the bower of facred lays,” that ihe received three plaudits At the concluiion. Tie jtsvo Italian Trios fung by Mrs. Crouch, Kei-ty, and MoltEt'Ll, were much applauded and encored; The Harp Concerto by young Meyer, was a rriifter-piece of taffe; delicacy, and execution. Tltp famous Battle Chorus was encored. The audience was numerous.	'
Co-vtnt-Garden.
.. .The remarks wc made on. the performance of Alexander's Feast, a fortnight fmee, render it unlretelfiry for us to expatiate more particularly on the.merits of Friday’s performance. The Selection con lifted of foms capital pieces, which were given in a ftyle of grandeur that drew' forth the warmdl plaudits of a very brilliant Houfe.
After the play, Mr. Bsnnifter, jun. came on in the ¿refs of a Fencing Mailer, with a foil in his hand, and announced thmfelfto be Jigbti gjfa:ky, in wh;ch tharafter he addreffcd the audicnbe, ar.d after a fc.v floutifhes in the tecnical language of the maitns ¡Formes, he defired to be conGfierr^l as
A kind of mongrel mental Fencing Mailer, armed for the pu poif of pinking thofe who carried a catcall, waging war'againft falle ctiticiim, put:ing an end to groans and hides, and determined to run Hander through the guts.
After much point and pleafautry of this fort, he came' to the main objeft of the compoCtion, viz. to befpeak the fevour of the audience, for the gentleman who that night was to cotne forward at friendihip’s call, and might be rather off his guard. He whimfically declaied, that the gentleman’s pnrpofe was not

Nor let the guilt lie heavy on his foul,

The Epilogue was written by Mr. Colman, jun. and was at once an undeniable proof of his fi iend-ihip, his wit, and hi» talents. All the technical allulions were coiredlly made, and applied with infinite humour and pleafanlry. It was admirably fpoken by Mr. Bannifter, jtin. Nor did Mr. Angelo prove uodeferving of Mr. Colman’s civility. He played the character in dofe imitation of Foote’s manner, and with great fucccfs. JgH
THEATRICAL TNttLL&FVCS. ■
Mr.Cohnanhexcellent Flay, called *ht Surrender of Calais, was yerferm-d yeiicrday evening at the Haymarkec Titmice, by the Drury-Ianc Company, for the benefit uf Mi.Buntii!ler,Jiin.aud we are hao-py to have it inour pov.'er to add,toa moil crowded audience. Mr. Palmer, Mr. Barrymore, Mr. Suett, and Mrs. Powtll, petfocmed the charaiieis of Rib-beaumont, Kivg Edward, the Serjeant and Julia. The other principal parr* were in the barSls of thofe performers who originally played them at Mr, Colman’e Theatre. The Play was well acted, Lut did not appear to the fame advantage as whan re-prefented «n ■ he (lage on the o'her fide the (licet. rheimmenGly of the King’s Theatre docs not aid theatr ical reprelcolation, tut rather tends to weaken its effect. The audience complimented Mr. Bin-niller, Janr. when he Grfl came on, whh a continued ihuuder of applaufe, and when Mr. John-.! (lone appeared, they hailed him in a very hand^ fome manner. His lad fong, and the three of Mrs. Bland were loudly encored.
Palmer and Barrym.ue played well, but the robe of the latter was more like that of au Opera Dancer than any part of the camp drefs of fo martial a Monarch as Edward the Third. In fact, it hid nothing of Englilh charatter about it.

The length of the debate prevented US from giving an account xjf the delightful Selection of Wed-nefday evening. Mr*. Crouch’s two airs were admirable. particularly her “ Sweet Bird,” which thrilled through every bread. The air of Morelli, and his trio wi'h Mis. Crouch and Kelly wete alio highly applauded, and were mod defervedlyciKorei. Little Walih alloniihcs us more and more every the London amateurs muft Gncttcly regret, that they are fo foon to |ofe him. Kelly being engaged every TVcdnefday at the Tottenham-flreet Concert, was only able to fing “ His Mighty Arm,” which he. gave with great efferrf. The chorufies were excellent, and the Houfc lafhion-able and crowded.

Mas. Jordan’s Night.
The Country Girl was the play, and the performance of Mts. Jt»idan met with univerfal a p-plaufe.	’
A New Entimaimnmt was introduced by Mrs. Jordan, and received with loud and reiterated peals of applaufer. Tfte chara&er of the Village Coquette gives to Mrs. Jordan a new opportunity of displaying the variety of her powers, and the author has happily given her two fongs, one without mufick, which juftly deferved the approbation it fo warmly received,: the other is in a martial ftyle, in which we mnft confefs the excelled her ufual out-doings. •
The Rural Breakfaft, or Fefteno, as given by the Hon. Mrs. Hobart, at Sans SoucT, is introduced with great effect; the Scenery is entirely new, and executed in the rnoft charming ftyle.—We are always glad to have an opportunity of favouring the excellence of Mrs. Hobart’s tafte, and to it the pub lick arf indebted for the arrangement of the piefcnt feene.
The piece is taken from. the French, by Mr.
Simons, who well deferves jhe applaufe bellowed laft night, and from which there can be no doubt of its future fuccefs, for its claims are founded upon novelty.
The mufic, which is light and fanciful, is the tompofition of Mr. NichoLi, and received univerfal applaufe. We congratulate the Managers on the reception of this piece, which from its merit, and the powerful ailing of Mrs. Jordan, cannot j fail of great attraftion, and repaying the cxpence ■ the Theatre muft have gone to in producing it.

Mrs. Sm^cys much to her honour, wrote Jd the Theatre yeftexday, to exprefs her anxious deure, that the run of the Fugitive lhould not be interrupted by a ffrift adherencc-to to her fub fitting Cttgigements with the Proprietors, ¡For appearing on a particular number of fixed nigh* st Ik coifequence of this liberal and elegant .offer, Mr. Richardson’» admirable Comedy cax> no* be performed at leali three times a week ; -e hare only to regret, that the benefits 1 however cannot be fufpended) to a degree,

! mterrtptions that have been given to the Ornunce of the Fttfitrve, are. infinitely to be “* ■ °y lovers of the Drama, and are , a ferious difappointment to the awakened curiofity of the publick. But let it be remembered that benefits, as they are the gratuitous remuneration on the part of the town, to ment, fuccefsfuiiy exerted in their fervice, are peculiarly entitled t-o a benevolent attention: and we will aniWer fòr Richard son, that a fufpenlion of his admired Comedy, fo produced, will be more confojaio'y to his mind, than if it arofe from any criVercaufe. The truth is, he ought to feel juttly-for fiat fraternity who have done fo much j a ilice toiim.

‘'I	Havmariet.
A fort of free tr(inflation of Metastasto’s
I£>oera, Didone, was exhibited at this dace laft night, und-r the tide of Dido, Qaeen of Carthage. As this piece was chiefly brought forward fir the purpofc of introducing M a tt a uoon the Englifli Stage in a new charailer, it holis forth a reafonable claim to critical lenity. The truth, however is, that in point of poetical merit,-it is not a work of much cnr.feqwnee. The Mufic is •well compiled from the Works of eminent Italian Compofers ; and S rot ace has added-fome of his own, t'-at does rot fuffer by a com 'ari'on with thé compofitions with which it is imningled. The Overtvf;, however, is not Fie happielt efforts of his foil!. Ma a a has much to do in the charailer of t)t do ; hut it is not calculated to draw forth the \v ole of her gretft powers, though foe touched all foe had to do ira very fuperior flyle. Mrs. Crovch, in Æneas, acquitted herfelf verv ir.eri-torio-iflv, and fung in a verv freer flyle. Kelly had all his ufual animation in Jeirbcu. Mils Barclay. who made hey foil public atipeara ,cein the -Oratorios at this Theatre, came forward as (inna. JHer voice is feeble, but the tone is not bad. S le Bid an encore, W ;ch relieved her from a weight o( diffidence. The Opera was we.il received ; but it «vas confiderafov too long, as it did not terminate till juft ten o’clock. , A prbeeflion was introduced, in which an Qflrich, A Dromedary and an EJstthrnt marched to flo-jj vmjk.

“ For tfie whole of the performers I have to fay, that their Zealand pride are fo blended to obtain your fupport, that it is impolfible their exertions fhould not follow the endeavours of the Proprietor, to render the entertainments worthy of your approbation j and proud are they when this. opportunity comes, that they may publickly dedare the fenie they have of your indulgence, and the happinefe they experience when their effoits can give you plealure.
“ I have to add for the Proprietors, that they hope their labours and expence, in preparing for your accommodation and entertainment for the the next feafon, will be found to merit what is both their ard the performers ultimate wiih—your patronage.” .
The Haymarket Theatte will, no doubt, fhortly produce fome novelty fjr the public eye ; but thi5 Summer muft. riot be expected to prove fo fplendid as the lalt. A piece of equal merit with the Surrenmtr of Calais, cannot be expelled every feafon.

On Saturday evening Pe great Theatre in the H.tvtn,:rfcit, was opened for the win’er. It did not g:ve to the town the moil prwnifiog hopes of their exertions to p’.eafs them, that Mr. Kemble, the tr. gedian, prefented I irnfelf in the comic chancier of Charles, in the Sc!jto!for Scandal. When 1 petihn thus determines to cuif.icc difguil, the public will become inquifitive as to the re .lions. I( cannot be igncr.mce, for Mr K'mble is dif-riplinc.i, by the repeated admonitions of the iudjer.ee, to abiLin from comedy. It ctr-lot he perfon.d vanity ; for his gl.ifs wcu'd tell him that all the powers of the htilrionic art cannot mould his features into a fmile of genuine cheer-fulnefs. He may enlighten his face for an inilant, by “ forcirg his foul up to his own conceit;” but his fmile performs its duty like an impreiied man, egcvfi the grain, and has neither the eafe nor the fpirit of a volunteer.
To what then can it be owing, But ar. unfpeakable condefcenfion, which induces him to brave ridicule, in order that he may five the proprietors the expence' of a qualified comedian. We do not mean to abllrail from the gallantry of this conduit in the Manager, but to a iFire him that it is an improvident ceconomy. The two Theatres havean advantageous monopoly ; in return for which they are bound to give the beilpollible entertainment to the public. There would be lefs objection to the advance of prices, from time to time, if the public faw the mea-fute accompanied with more ardent efforts to pl.afe; but they mull not be tcld, that it is a tax upon luxury, wr.ich no man needs to pay unlefs hepicafes. Tnis could o.n'y be true, if the Stage were uq-luackled by charters, and if it were left open to any man to build a Theatre.
We have made this obfervstion on Mr. Kemble’s Charles, becab-'e the other parts of the play are executed with fuch nuflerly talents, that they make the contrait more obvious and irkfame. An ac tomplifhed Comedim is wanted to make the Schoo-ror Scandal an entertainment from which tail* would derive its moll delicious banquet.

There was little in the performance of laft right to merit the attention of the Town. If the Haunted Tower had no other recommendation than Kelly’s iong of execution, it ought however to be dear to the public, for his long is a fchool to vocal performers. His ailion in it is graceful, nervous, and impreffive. We wifh that our ftill-life fingers would form themfelves on his model.
In Catharine and Petruekio there was mummery that would have difgr„ » d Bartholomew Fair.— JfionJello knocked his feliow-fervant dov/n, and afterwards fpit in his face “ to fuitthe ailion to the word.” Such flrollers play is unworthy of what, by the way of diftioftion, we call a Royal Theatre ! A little more attention to their habits al'fo would not be improper in the aftors. Mr. Palmer and Mr. Baddeley came forward immediately after the defeription of their antic dieiErs, without having correctly one fingle article as deferibed. Of Mrs. Goodall, as the mere fubftitute of Mrs. Jordan, we do not fpeak.—She was tam« when a fhrew, and afhtew when tamed.

iUTMAiimr ?H£A7R&
Lift night tvas performed the re-viicdcomedy ( »!: the bills ityled it) of Love Makes a Man, or hi Fop's Fortune, a play patched up by Cibber, out of two of Beaumont and Fletcher’s, Tit Elder Brother and The Cvjh-m of the Country. Nothing can be laid in favour of the plot, at leaf! if the firlt part be excepted, nor is there either much, fagacity or knowledge of nature displayed in the charaflers ; but the buflie and variety of incidents and perplexities, and that odd humour of Cibber’s, which Concrete called “ fomething like wit,” have made this Comedy a greater ailing favourite than many plays of far fuperior merit.
The alterations [»romifed in the bills chiefly con-lifted in the onfimon of foir.c plTages, and one whole feene, generally retained before ; and the addition of fome ipeeches hitherto generally emitted. For \yith relpetfl to the numerous deviations from the author in fingle words, forms of exprel-fion, tranfpofition of the different members of the Fniences, &C- we have too great a regard to th? Manager’s judgment, than to believe that tbefe variations were in any degree owing to him, or made any part of bjs plan. 'To Fy the truth, we have, not without regret, long obferved that this habit of varying flora the author’s words has gained'ground upon the flage; and we fhould be glad to put a flop, if it were in our power, to this inveterate evil. For this prailice. there can only be one of two reafons : Either they thiok it indifferent in what language the authoi’s ideas are clothed, provided they barely reprefent the fkeleton of the feotiment; or they H itter themfdves that th.ey can improve his rude expreflions by the force of their own happy genius. In the firlt cafe, they are guilty of an unpardonable negligence ; in the fecond, sf a vanity that ought to be correlated ;—in the one they p.iy too little refpeil .0 their audience, in the other too much to them-felves. We mean this eenfure to be extended to
tne generality cr plays that we hare of late feen ailed. But as this lame play was given out again for next Saturday, we hope that the performers, if they cannot, or will hot, reform this vice altogether, they will at leaf! reform it indifrrent •well. They may remember what a certain author, whale judgment ought to have fome weight on thefe points, fays, concemuig the infertions of wit fometimes made by the players. “ There be of them, that will themfelves laugh, to fet on fome quantity of barren Jpe&ators to laugh too; though in the mem time, lame neceffary queitioa of tne play be then to be confidered : that's villainous ; audjhe-.us a tnojl pitiful ambition in the fool that ufes
it." In juilice to Mr. Kemblf, he is to be exempted from this reproach. He was very accurate.
Mr. BaCDeley, in Antonio, was not very fuc-cefsful.' He has a habit of railing his voice, with a provincial accent, at the concluding word of the fentence. Mt. King too, we think, is in part liable to the fijne cenfure. Perhaps, thefe gentlemen may have contraile i this fault from endeavouring to avoid |its oppofite extreme (which lias lately become very fafhror.able), of finking the voice too much at the lall word of the fpeech. The Aril, is Certainly milch the more pardonable mi/lake of the two. Though we were very well pleafed with Don Lewis upon the whole, yet, in our opinion, he dwelt too long upon his fentences, where the fubjeil, and the peculiarity of the charaitir, leeir.ed to demand a more rapid elocution. This was a fault common to him with Mr. Kemble’s Carlos. While Carlos was only the bookworm, the mere reclufe, the folitary ftudent, Mr. Kemble was completely at home ; but when he falls in love, we fear, he retained too much gravity to make him agreeable to a lady. In the one fenfe of his mif-trefs, he fhouid become quite a new man. The light of Angelina ihould roule him from his fcholafiic lethargy ; it ought to operate upon him (to ufs Mr. Smirk's expreffion) “ like a touch from tire Promethean torch,” and animate the ftatue with life.”
Mr. Donn’s Clodio was, on the whole, accurate and judicious ; but perhaps a little, a very little more aftion, might not have had a diftgreeable effeil. Mrs. Goodall’s Angelina was pleafing; and all the principal ladies were drefled in moil becoming taile : a circumllance of theatrical merit, which we are fo far from defnifi.kg, that we recommend it to every ailor’s fenous and particular at* teation.

Talking of maiden aunts, lomehow *r other, puts me in mind of virgins.—In your tragedies (for I expeft fomething of the kind from you, as Sir. Kemble has confented to play difmal again) ; I fay in your tragedies beware of virgins.—In r,v* lait tragedy, I accommodated my heroine with a vi-gin to bear up her train ; and the huffcy bore a child within an hour of my benefit-night.
And, this, by the bye, leads me to mention am.it-ter of great confequence to you. In giving out the parts of your play (provided you have any voice in the arrangement), it is af great confequeice to attend to the health and wealth of your performers. During my dramatic progrefs, I loft a great deal by pregnancy ; and nothing, indeed, can be fo mortifying to the pride of authcrfhip, as to have the run of a new piece interrupted by the fquall of a baby, or the touch of a bailiff. If I were a Manager, it fhould go hard but I would prevent both. —My aftreffes fliould be nuns, and my aftors Members of Parliament.
As to dialogue, it is very immaterial what kind it be, only fuit it to the performer. If he is a dull dog, you mull nuke it up in fet fpeeches ; but if he makes faces, the l«fs faid the better. Betides, feme of them have of late fo eminently diftinguifh-ed themfelves for extempore compofuion, that you need not give them more than nn outline, leaving all the reft to their improvifatorial genius. Some authors have been even at pains te prick down the dammees, although thefe are well known to be ad /¡¿¡turns. An eminent comic ait or Ltely afTured me, “ no mar. can tell when a damme fhould some in, before he has entered -warnl'y into hit character
\ The fentimental dialogue will of courfe engrofs your attention; all your morality and falvation depend on this. In writing the modern fentimental, I know of no better rule than to make your fentences very long. When an aftrefs is out of breath, and gafping paffes for fenfibility, you cannot fail of a clap.—As to moral fpeeches, I would, as ufual, keep them for the old men, the half-pay generals, and otner make-weights. Fine ladies and gentlemen Ihould always have a great deal of wit on the ftage, efpecially if you intend them for originals.

TO DRAMATIC AUTHORS. ‘
LADIES AND GENTLE MEN,
At the commencement of a new feafen, when wc have got a new houfe, and have reafon to expefl from you a number of tie*» pieces, permit a brother-writer to addrefs a few hints to you.—I havt made no fmall figure in forne of thole fituations is which you will probably ftand. I truft that you art all now returned from your furtimer excurfions, and that you have prepared your Tragedies, Comedies, Operas, and Farces, at thofe marts of wit an* re. partee, Margate, Brighton, Weymouth, and Chel. ter.ham. It is fortunate, Ladies and Gentlemen, for die Stage, where the demand for novelty is ifi-cefiant, that you do not keep your pieces nine years, as was the old fafhion, but confider nine -wests as quite fuffident preparation for what, in the com. mon courfe of nature, cannot lift above nine days. Plot, fable or ftory, has no doubt been your firft conflderation ; and you have, no doubt, adopted the old plan of an upper and an under-plot, or a Grft and a fecond, as fome chufe to call them.—To this I have no objection—ail I wifh is, that you fhould form fome fmall connexion, ever fo trifling, between thofe two plots, and that (if it is poflibie, but by no means elle) you would caft an eye now and then towards probability or common fenfe.—I did lately, indeed, fuppofe that all under-plots were to be done away, when I heard of a Theatre built without a gallery.— I began to oonfider the plebeian under-plots, compofet! generally of fcrvants, chambermaids, and peaiants, as wholly unneceflary, and that it would become us to write for the boxes only. But as John Ball infifts on having his fhillmgf-worth, you may as well go on the old way — N. B. From the advanced prices, you will pleafe to take notice, tint John is entitled to only onefxth part of your attention.
As to characters, they being fo numerous, the great point is, to make a proper affortment, and fo to vary them, that they may eafiiy pals from the tomic to the tragic, and from that (an eafy ttanfition) to the farcical. The ufual collection confifts, if I miftake not, in a Lord,a Colonel,an Irifhman (whether a peer, or a peafant, fignifies little) a beau, an old merchant, a fniveling fteward, a country ferrant, maiden aunt, pert chambermaid, wanton widow, and, above all, a young lady (who does not know her own parents, until the laft aft) qui’e running over with fentiment. Lords and Colonels are pretty much the fame they have ever been—I defpair of mending them—Iriihmen have of late been made to blunder upon morality and fine feelings—virtue certainly is amiable with a brogue. In the manufacture of maiden aunts, the chief matter attended to of late years, has been their circumference. Mrs. Webb is a model of this kind, for all lines draivn from the centre to the circumference are equal ; (he has confequently more wit flying round about her, than any aftrefs on the ftage; except, perhaps, her fifter-in-bulk at the other houfe. The country Managers are now aware cf the advantages 0 theatrical thicknefs. One of them (hewed me ? regular charge ou his books-—“ For fluffing mallei aurts.”—

The ftrufhire of the piede is French, and the chief, or rather the only interefting incident, is in dumb fhew. The plot is founded on Spaniih jealoufy, though the feene is Lid in America. It is the old ftory^one at Croft Purpofct, except that here the paffio.is are deeply tragical, and chains, imprifonment, and death, are the fubjed throughout. The pleafure it gave was greatly due to Airs. Bxahd, metamorphofed into a drummer, and to Mifs Menage, a child, who fpoite and afted with a degree of intelligence, which we often look foi in vain in her feniors. However, it was the general fenfe of the houfe, that the drunken feene was te* dious, and rather difgufting than comic.
The muftc of this piece is chiefly the competition of Mr. Atw ood, who, we understand, is an elevc of his Royal Highnefs the Prince of Wales. Had Mr. Atwooo attempted left, he would have been more fuceefsfuf. The, overture has neither originality nor fpirit, and the bravura fangs are “ full of found and fury, fignifying nothing.” Some of the airs are however pieafmg, particularly Mrs. Bland’s drum ballad, which (he fuag charmingly, and little Walsh'S fong in the Grit ait. Kelly gave the fongs allotted to him with his ufual talle and energy, but the perpetual rattling of his chains in the prifon fcene, as an accompaniment to the muftc, has, in our opinion, a very bad effeft.
The entertainment upon the whole was very favourably received, and given out for Saturday , with conGderable applaufe.	„
The following is a fpeciraen of the fongs :
AIR—Mr DionosA.
Whene’er (hebade me code to plead.
Her bread wou’d gently heave,
And grav'd her Up beguil’d a heart IB-practis'd »0 deceive.
As fweUing wave, that feem inclin’d.
To greet the (harts they leave behind.
AIR—Aire Crouch.
Come from Horror’s dreary ceU,
Where Jealoufy delights to dwell—*
Come, fell Revenge, that never Beeps,—
,. Revenge her fang in mortal potion iteeps,
And madly laughs and weeps.
And fmiles at rival’s pangs, and acts the deeds of hcJL Come, thou that art above cootrool,
Route my vait purpofe—all my madden’d foul 1

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
U /7c :
Dfiu bv-Haymaricet.
The re-appearance of Mrs. Jordan, added to the attraflion ulually inherent to a new produftion, drew together, as might be ex-peeled, an overflowing audience at the fir ft reprefentation of the Comedy of Ann a laft night. Mrs. Jordan was welcomed with every mark of good-will and approbation, and ieemed to have loft nothing of her comic powers by an abfence from the ftage. Of the merit of the piece little can be laid, it conftfted in fitnations By no means new, as was mentioned in the Epilogue. No left than three couple of lovers are introduced, and among them Mrs. Jordan in the cha-rafter of Anna, appears the foremoft. The dialogue is deftitnte of wit or point, and the miferable pans allotted to Bannijlar and Suit! bring upon them, undefervedly, the con-, tempt of the auditors. An eccentric country Chambermaid is perfonated by Mrs .Bland, who is aHb made a fuhjcfl of laughter by the ludicrous ftile of her drefs. Some ful-fome compliments are indelicately applied tb the Englifh generality of chara&er, but with fo little diferimination as to be quite difgufting. The fame is prafiifed in the Epilogue, which in the latter part is more relative to the fpeaker, Mis .Jordan, than to the fubjeft it pinfefles to treat on.
The piece poHefting nothing like a plot, and being perfeftly uninterefting, was much difapproved, fo that it will, no doubt, be foon conftgned to obligion. Palmer contributed to its bad reception, by being ablent when he Was moft wanted on the ftage, and occafioning thereby an aukward chafm, which put the audience out of humour. - He was otherwife highly reprehcnfible for hi* imperfefUons in his part.
