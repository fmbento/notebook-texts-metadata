THE FOLLOWING
ADDRESS
*
Has been received, as written, expressly for this occasion, by a Gentleman of Manchester ; the reason it cannot be spoken on the Stage, is, in consequence of its not having passed the Lord Chamberlain’s OlTice.
“ Hard is the fate of the infirm and poor !”
In times like these, the truths of this is sure.
How many do we see, by hunger led,
Crave, with imploring looks, their daily bread ? Can any eye, e’er bath’d by pity’s tear,
Refuse the drop of cordial Comfort here ?
Can any heart the piteous suit withstand ?
Can Man from Man xvithold his helping hand ?
Fair Charity ! we supplicate thy pow’r ;
Oh! save the poor in this inclement hours O’er them .extend thine all-protecting wing,
And for their Comfort, food and raiment bring. Benevolence ! here let thy bounty flow;
Teach fellow-man to feel a Brother’s woe !
Who opes his hand to soften sorrow’s cares,
May he ne’er want the mite he kindly spares.
To you, ye Fair ! we make our last appeal,
Surely, your tender hearts can warmly feel ;
The female-heart is pity’s known recess;
’Tis your affection, only, Man can bless !
Prove that you also boast the lib’ral mind ;
We knoxv you’re lovely, be ye also kind ;
Bestow your favors—aid our gen rous cause ;
And thus secure the world and Heav’n’s applause !
Give—all rvho can—your fellow-creatures food, And, in return, accept—their Gratitude !
