BENEFIT

OF

THE SUFFERERS AT T H E
BRUNSWICK THEATRE.
T H E Public is most respectfully informed, that Mr. DOWNE, desirous of affording a channel
by which the Gentry and Inhabitants of Hull may contribute to the Charitable Fund now raising
at the Theatres-Royal Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden, in behalf of the Sufferers at the New
Brunswick Theatre, intends devoting the Profits of this Night to that purpose; and, from the
liberality attributed to the Patrons of the Hull Theatre, doubts not the means will be eagerly
embraced, and the result prove that the influence of commiseration and benevolence extends
beyond the precincts of the Metropolis.

This Evening, THURSDAY,

March 13tA, 1828,

His Majesty's Servants will perform the popular Drama of

T h e E a r t h in the E c l i p t i c , represented by a glass G l o b e , six feet in circumference, accurately adjusted, b y which the diurnal
and annual motion of the E a r t h and its Parallelism, the interesting causes of D a y , N i g h t , T w i l i g h t , long and short D a y s , and the
different Seasons, are agreeably and beautifully r e p r e s e n t e d ; this being the only scene ever yet introduced that is competent t o
e l u c i d a t e the three-fold motion of the E a r t h .
T h e D i u r n a l a n d Annual motion of the E a r t h a n d Moon round t h e S u n , b y which the P h e n o m e n a of the E a r t h and M o o n ,
their relative situations, and t h e Eclipses of the S u n and M o o n , are clearly and fully demonstrated.
T h e whole Solar S y s t e m , with every Planet and Satellite, including the Georjjium S i d u s , Piazzi, O l b e r s , J u n o , and Vesta, in A n nual and D i u r n a l motion—their revolutions, oppositions, and conjunctions ; forming a most sublime and beautiful Spectacle.
A C o m e t will descend in a parabolic c u r v e , from the top of the Machine, progressively accelerated in its approach towards the
S u n , and t u r n i n g r o u n d that luminary, gradually retarded—describing equal areas in equal times, agreeably to the laws of P l a n e t a r y
motion
T h e D i u r n a l motion of the E a r t h round its Axis, its Annual motion r o u n d the S u n , and that round t h e common centre of G r a vity with the M o o n , familiarly explaining the universal Law of G r a v i t a t i o n , and its influence in p r o d u c i n g the S p r i n g and N e a p

A view of t h a t * x q u i s i t e l y refined relation between Celestial and S u b l u n a r y N a t u r e , in which the whole volume of the Heavens,
every Stur in the N o r t h e r n and S o u t h e r n Celestial Hemisphere, and the countless millions of Stars, which constitute the Milky W a y ,
will be represented
t o t h e S p e c t a t o r ; likewise a representation of o u r Solar System, in unison with other S y s t e m s ; the whole
divinely harmonized and m u t u a l l y dependent on each other.
Each varied Scene will be beautifully descriptive, and perfectly explanatory of the varied Phenomena of the Heaven*; and the Stars which constitute the
twelve Signs of the Zodiac, will have a familiar and impressive introduction. A telescopic view of the Comet of 1811, which appeared so placid ami benign in
the Arctic Sky. It will also receive wonderful assistance from auxiliary aid, &c.
These Lectures beine intended to direct the Inquiring mind through Nature " u p to Nature's God," SEMINARIES and FAMILIES will find the present offer

was an observation of S I R ISAAC NEWTON, that Nature anil Philosophy, which explains
the Phenomena of Nature, do always agree with Divine Revelation. The Science of Astronomy, in an emphatic manner, demonstrates this sublime and sacred truth. The Theatre is
therefore open for the only time: the terras easy of access to every individual who has now
an opportunity of contemplating the glorious works of the Creator, for God is ever present—
ever near—in the wide waste, as in the city full; in the midst of a Theatre, as in a Holy
Temple : here the Infidel will feel reclaimed, a beam of Deity will illumine his benighted
mind; a ray of immortality will dart upon his soul, and he will be persuaded to become a
Christian.
IT

Parents and Preceptors will feel the interests of the rising generation eminently consulted,
should they feel it eligible to embrace the opportunity now presented to them of attending
this elegant, familiar, and instructive Course of Astronomy.
An offering so replete with local accommodation may never recur.

an accurate idea of the general constru.ti o n of the Universe, These Lectures will bo illustrated by a new

the Earth—Attraction of gravitation (real cause of,) illustrated by experiments—Present inclination of the Earth's Axis—Diminution of the angle of
the Ecliptic, and its consequences, shewn to have formed the basis or thu Chaldean and Egyptian Astro-Theology—Pictorial and symbolical writing

celebrated Zodiac of Dcnderah, and various other ancient monuments—Origin and meaning of the Sphynx—Precossion of the Equinoxes—Secondary

Hindoos, with the life and doctrine of Jesus Christ—Allusions to the expected Messiah, shewn to have been prevalent throughout the Eastern World
ages before the Christian aura, typified in the MYTHRUS, HORUS, and-BRAHMEE, of the above nations [this knowledge probably derived from
prophecy—facts earnestly recommended to the consideration of Deists]— Th» Chronological periods of the Chinese proved to have been a r b i t r a r y Astronomical Key to the Chronology of the Hebrews, &c.

ADDRESS

(Written by Mr. W. L. Rede,)
WILE. B S UH CITED BY BIB. C A L V E S T .

The Performances of the Evening will commence with the National Anthem,

" GOD SAVE T H E KING,"

W I T H A FULL CHOHBS.

MR. CUMMINS
Conceives it due to his future Patrons to place before them some of the leading
principles of his intended system of management.
Deeply impressed as he is with the advantages resulting to society, from a
carefully directed Theatre, as well as the moral and literary superiority of the
Legitimate Drama, Mr. C. cannot but attribute any occasional declension, to
the too general practice of administering to bad taste and depraved appetite, in
place of maintaining the exalted station which has ever been the attribute of
the Dramatic Muse. In the conviction that those walls, which have echoed to
the inspirations of Shakspeare, or the wit of Congreve and Sheridan, are degraded by the display of mere muscular effort, or the " Sports of the Ring,"
Mr. CUMMINS announces his attention of devoting the Hull Stage (during the
term of his Management) to its avowed purpose, the LEGITIMATE DRAMA. His
utmost means will be devoted to this end; and he asks for support so long
only as this may be unequivocally obvious. Although, in the opinion of a '
popular writer, " every species of mendacity seems licensed by custom in a
play-bill," Mr. C. is resolved never to lose sight of the respect due to the
Audience, as well as himself. No announcement of " N e w Scenery, Dresses,
&c." will ever be made, unless literally true: nor will he insult the frequenters
of the Theatre by a detail of the remarkable features of a Drama, or recapitulation of the Songs, &c. in an Opera, announced for Performance. By a careful
regard to internal regulations, Mr. CUMMINS announces, that the Entertainments of each Evening shall comprise, to the full, as much matter as usual,
and terminate at an hour unprecedently early. Mr. CUMMINS further pledges
himself that his care in abating those Nuisances, more or less attendant upon
all places of public amusement, shall be unceasing; and from his success
hitherto in such an object, he confidently anticipates the most satisfactory results. Mr. CUMMINS has too well-founded a knowledge of the Public of Hull
to suffer any restrictive feeling in expenditure to influence him, and throws
himself fearlessly on its support, fully satisfied that if he fails, he cannot have
deserved to succeed.

TOM COFFIN TAVERN,

Late Manager of the principal Theatres in the West Riding, and of the
Minor Theatre in this Town.
ASSISTED ON THE OCCASION BY SEVERAL

AMATEURS OF KNOWN AND TRIED

ABILITY,

AND PROFESSIONAL LADIES A N D GENTLEMEN.

The THEATRE-ROYAI. in Kingston'pon-Hull,

I hope on the Nineteenth of May will be full,
That is to say almost—not quite—though it may—
Nay it will, if all go who have promised to pay.
And I now most respectfully ask all my friends
To attend on that night—as on that it depends,
I'll endeavour to cater to their satisfaction,
Once more calling forth all my powers of attraction.
But let us be brief—'tis the spirit of wit,
And it rhymes—as it should—to invite to the Pit;
And as one for the Gallery 's not equally easy
To find, then for RhymiDg's sake why should I tease ye—
So at once, you're right welcome to all parts ('tis certain)
Of the THEATRE-ROYAL, before the Green Curtain.
The Play is J O H N BULL, and it commonly cures
Blue Devils and Dismals, and always ensures
A treat to the Public and all the playgoers.
I've a few Amateurs to assist—kindly hearts—
And they're all of them perfect, and tried in their parts.
Professional Ladies, and some of the Gents
Are Professional too; therefore to all intents
And purposes, you will perceive that the Play
Will be acted as well as it need be—so pray
Take your Tickets and Places without more delay.
And I'll give a MELANGE, and T W O FARCES beside,
Of one I'm the Author, the other 's been tried,
And so too has mine pass'd the ordeal with glee,
And I hope 'twill again—If you please come and see.
'Tis called and entitled "MISS POP." She's a rum 'un
Is the Lady that I play,—the other's a woman.
With many more Nick-nacks, got up with precision,
All known—except those of our own composition.
Next comes "ROBIN ROUGHHEAD"—and
humbly I move,
Though he's last, let him not be the least in your love.
—And to sum up the whole in few words, I would say
That I hope you'll remember the Nineteenth of May.

upon the earth; and let them be for signs and for seasons,
and for days and for years." He made the stars also.
In splendour bright is rising now
The sun, and darts his rays;
A joyful, tender, happy spouse;
A giant proud and glad
To run his measured course.
With softer beams and milder light, steps on
The silver moon, through silent night.
The space immense of the azure sky,
Innumerous hosts of radient orbs adorn.
And the sons of God announced the fourth day
In songs divine, proclaiming thus his power:—

His breath was our arrow, his word was our sword.

Blow, gentle gales, and on your wing
Our long-expected succours bring.
Look! look again! 'tis all in vain.
Lo ! behold ! a pennant waving!
"Tis the sea-Jird 's pinions laving.
Hark ! a signal fills the air,
'Tis the beetling rocks resounding,
'Tis the hollow wave rebounding,
Wild as our hopes—deep as our despair.

Mr. White.
Mary ; I believed thee true,
And I was blest in thus believing;
But now 1 mourn that e'er I knew
A girl so fair and so deceiving.
Few have ever loved like me>
O ! I have loved thee too sincerely ;
And few have e'er deceived like thee,
Alas ! deceived me too severely.
Fare thee well. Fare thee well.

5
Fare thee well, yet think awhile
On me, whose bosom bleeds to doubt thee,
Who now would rather trust that smile,
And die with thee, than live without thee.
Fare thee well, I'll think of thee,
Thou leav'st me many a bitter token,
For see, distracting woman, see,
My peace is gone, my heart is broken.
Fare thee well. Fare thee well.

Water parted from the sea
May increase the river's tide,
To the bubbling fount may flee,
Or through fertile valleys glide:
Though, in search of lost repose,
Through the land 'tis free to roam;
Still it murmurs as it flows,
Panting for its native home.

Si lagna e sospira;

OVERTURE.. (Der Beherrscher der Geister)

FRENCH MEIODY.

Mr. White.
O! no, we never mention her,
Her name is never heard ;
My lips are now forbid to speak
That once-familiar word.
From sport to sport they hurry me,
To banish my regret;
And when they gain a smile from me,
They think that I forget.
WEBEB.

Mrs. Cummins and Mr. White.

They bid me seek in change of scene
The charms that others see;
But were I in a foreign land
They'd find no change in me.
'Tis true that I behold no more
The valley where we met,
I do not see the hawthorn tree,
But how shall I forget ?

Da quel sembiante appresi,
L'arte d'amor fedele ;
E benche sia crudela,
Amaila voglio ancor.
Se nell inganno vivi,
Nell tuo fatal martire;
Non cessero di dire
Ch'ai troppo erudo il COT.

They tell me she is happy now,
The gayest of the gay;
They hint that she forgets mc,
But heed not what they say.
Like me perhaps she struggles with
Each feeling of regret ;
But if she loves as I have loved,
She never can forget.

PHILIPFS.

Mr. G. Bennett.
Tho' my eyes may grow dim, and m y locks t u r n to grey,
I shall feel not the storms of life's bleak winter's day ;
For m y cot is well t h a t c h ' d , a n d m y barns are well stored,
And cheerful content still presides at m y board.
The traY'ler is welcome who stops at m y door,
And a crust I can spare to the neighbouring poor.
The glow of m y heart does each bounty repay,
And lightens the cares of life's bleak winter's day.
In life's early years, I look'd down in the vale,
Where age pines in poverty, sickly and pale:
While those high-raised Dy fortune scarce deign to bestow
One heart-cheering smile on the wand'rer below.
But tho' hardships assail'd, at misfortune I'd smile.
For light is the bosom u n b u r t h e n ' d with guile.
And the glow of m y heart shall each sorrow repay,
And give sunshine of joy in life's bleak winter's day.

'Tis when to sleep the world retires,
That forth the robber steals;
The thirst of gain his heart inspires,
Nor fear his bosom feels.
Ere we q u i t the cave profound,
The silent watchword passes round,
In whisper'd sound.
Then as we tread t h e secret dell,
W e hear the distant village bell,
A passing k n e l l .
Still as undaunted on we stray
T h r o u g h many a tangled brake,
W e pause to mark the silent way
The cautious trav'lers take ;
Then from each scabbard flies the sword,
And P l u n d e r is the word
That r o u n d is heard.
In vain the timid victim flies,
In vain for aid or mercy cries;
He dies!

GRAND TRIO

(first time in Hull.)

Her dark brown hair is braided
O'er a brow of spotless white;
Her soft blue eye now languishes,
Now flashes with delight.
The hair is braided not for me,
The eye is turned away ;
Yet my heart, my heart is breaking,
For the love of Alice Gray.

BISHOP.

Mrs. Cummins, Miss Burrell, and Mr. Hart.
Mrs. C. In pity hear my ardent prayer,
Nor drive your suppliant to despair.
Mr. H. In vain you plead, you know your fate,
Rejected love now turns to hate.
Miss B. Does not her grief your pity move.
The victim spare of faithful love.
Mrs. C. Oh ! save me from the dire decree,
And let me owe my life to thee.
Miss B. Oh ! save her from the dire decree,
And trust her heart shall grateful be.
Mr. H. My solemn vow I must obey,
Your death's decreed at dawn of day.
Mrs. C. and MissB. To sacred vows and love still true,

I've sunk beneath the summer's sun,
And trembled in the blast;
But my pilgrimage is nearly done,
The weary conflict's past.
And when the green sod wraps my grave,
May pity haply say
Oh! his heart, his heart was broken
For the love of Alice Gray.

Beloved youth, j ^ ' ^ £ for you.

A love without decay.
Oh! my heart, my heart is breaking,
For the love of Alice Gray.

The maid for whom I languish,
Whene'er I wishful sigh,
Must haste to heal love s anguish,
To meet my vow must fly.
To beauty bright as morning,
Or love-lorn swain e'c - saw,
My offered passion scornmg,
Adieu, jusqu'au revoir.
The maid of soul most tender,
Must prize my constant care ;
To her of fire, 1 render
A heart as free as air.
But should the haughty fair one
Enforce tyrannic law,
To her, though ne'er so rare one,
Adieu, jusqu'au revoir.

SONG

Irish Melody.
Miss Burrell.
O leave me to my sorrow,
For my heart is oppress'd to day ;
O leave, and to-morrow
Dark shadows may pass away.
There's a time when all that grieves us
Is felt with a deeper gloom ;
There's a time when hope deceives us,
And we dream of bright days to come.
In winter, from the mountain,
The stream like a torrent flows ;
In summer, the same fountain,
Is calm as a child's repose.
Thus in grief, the first pangs wound us,
And tears of despair gush on,
Time brings forth new flowers around us,
And the tide of our grief is gone.
Then heed not my pensive hours,
Nor bid me be cheerful now ;
Can sunshine raise the flowers
That droop on a blighted bough.
The lake in the tempest wears not
The brightness its slumber wore,
The heart of the mourner cares not
For joys that were dear before.

EXTRAVAGANZA . .11 Fanatico per la Musica..English
Version..Mr. Baker, a la mode Signor De Begnis.

Preciosa! woman's envy,
Man's delight, and love, and praise ;
To her beauty's sunny splendour
We our voices loudly raise.
Preeiosa! woman's envy.
Thus may hope, and love, and pleasure,
Cheer her path with mingling rays
Thus may all that mortals treasure,
Crown her life with length of days.
THE CELEBRATED ECHO CHORUS.

(Six Horns Obligati.)
Through woods and lonely dells and hills,
Where echo dwells,
To shrill sounding horn, on fantastic toe.
We merrily,merrily, onward go,
Trara! trara!
The world to us is given,
Our tent the vault of heaven.
To shrill sounding horn, on fantastic toe,
Thus merrily through the wide world we go.
Trara !*trara!
AIR. Mrs. Cummins.
Though from him I love afar,
How near me still he seems to stray ;
Shedding round, like yonder star,
A hallowing power and soothing sway.
E'en the few short hours of sleep
That weary nature steals from woe,
Bids me still his absence weep,
And still the joys of hope forego.
Ever thus o'er hill and plain,
With me his image still will stray.
Life can now know joy nor pain,
While torn from him I love away.

GYPSIES' GLEE AND CHORUS.

With mirth and song we pass along,
Whatever reception we rind.
Content's bright ray still lights our way,
And sorrow we give to the wind.
Or near or far, one only star
Still shines on our wandering way;
In thee, in thee, that star we see,
While with thee, Preciosa, we stray.
VINALE—GLEE AND CHOBUS.

The stars that in clusters shine o'er us,
To earth had a soul-cheering glow;
Though midnight broods darkly before us,
Our pathway grows bright as we go.
As stars gem the azure of heaven,
That else were mere darkness and night,
So hope's starry beams have been given,
To shine when joy looses her height.
But brighter than all the stars o'er us,
As hope in misfortune's dark night,
Is love setting smiling before us,
With beauty's majestical light.
To earth fate awarded three treasures,
Like stars on life's darkness to shine;
And mortals may taste those true pleasures,
When love smiles on laughter and wine.

By particular desire, "* God save the King" will he
sung, as harmonized by BOCHSA, and with the celebrated
Accompaniments for a Grand Orchestra, composed by him,
and performed at the King's Theatre on the last Anniversary of His Majesty's Birth-day.

The Lord he will have mercy,
In peace he keepeth Zion.

Deeper and deeper still, thy goodness, child,
Pierceth a father's bleeding heart, and checks
The cruel sentence on my faltering tongue.
Oh ! let me whisper it to the raging winds
Or howling deserts; for the ears of men
It is too shocking. Yet, have I not vow'd ?
And can I think the great Jehovah sleeps,
Like Chemosh, and such fabled deities ?
No.—Ah ! heaven heard my thoughts, and wrote
them down.
It must be so—'tis this that racks my brain,
And pours into my heaTt a thousand pangs
That lash me into madness. Horrid thought!—
My only daughter—and so dear a child—
Doom'd by a father! Yes—the vow is past,
And Gilead hath triumph'd o'er his foes.—
Therefore, to-morrow's dawn—I can no more.

Uplifted roars the boisterous sea.

In serpent error rivers flow.
Softly purling, glides along
Through silent vales, the limpid brook.

Of him who ever rules alone,

He only is my rock, and my salvation,
And my defence, and I shall not be moved.
In God is my salvation, and my glory,
The rock of my defence; my refuge is in God.

And praise.him all ye people;
For the merciful kindness and truth of the Lord
Endureth for ever. Praise ye the Lord.

The interest excited by this Piece arises from the following circumstances:
The great affection of the MONKEY for his Master, T H E DUMB SAVOYARD, and his
anxiety to ascertain bis Master's wishes—his strenuous endeavours to assist in their completion
—combating with the effects of his natural propensity to imitation productive of some serious
mistakes and LUDICROUS BLUNDERS—involving the objects of his solicitude in CONSIDERABLE D I F F I C U L T I E S , from which however ho becomes I N S T R U M E N T A L in

•d Comic Sonff, by Jflr.

Angel.

T o conclude with the Popular Melo-Drame, called

Luke the Labourer;
Or, The Lost Son.
Since the production of" George Barnwell," no Drama has appeared so highly calculated to
•mend the heart, check the progress of ungovernable passion, and excite the tenderest sympathies of human nature, as the above Piece. The incidents are of that description which can not
fail to interest every class of auditors. From this Piece, the man of austere principles may
learn to look with a charitable eye on the errors of a fellow creature, and extend that mercy he
~»J .He day require; and the revengeful character may be taught that the completest triumph
over an enemy, is to F O K . I T E . The story is founded on fact; and the interest of the Piece is
e •ifiderably heightened from local circumstances, the plot lying immediately in the vicinity of
York.

Master Burke
I* Engaged to Perform this Evening.
MR. BUTLER, in conformity with the general wish, despatched a messenger to Mr. BURKE to request his Son's services for one of the Regatta nights.
The following answer which he received from the Secretary, he respectfully lays
before the Public.
MALTON, 25th August, 1829.
Dear Sir,
I am desired by Mr. BURKE to acknowledge the receipt of yours,
wherein you state that a great disappointment has been expressed on the part
of several families in HUM., at not having MASTER BURKE there during the
present public week. Not having contemplated so signal an instance of continued attachment to his Son, (after his having made three visits in rapid
succession, and taken a formal leave of the Hull audience), he had made
arrangements for his performing in other quarters. But the receipt of your
letter has caused him to alter those arrangements. Mr. BURKE bids me say,
that be should consider himself extremely ungrateful were he to refuse to
"fatily a wish so kindly expressed,; and will take care that Master BURKE shall
ne in Hull on THURSDAY, so as to perform there the'same Evening.
I beg to remain,
Dear Sir,
Yours, obediently,
_

This present THURSDAY,

After which, (for the first and only time at tlijs Theatre,) a comic Drama, written expressly for
MasUr Burke, and performed by him in London with the most enthusiastic applause, called

Home for the
OR, YOUNG MASTER.
This piece is founded on an ancient custom, still observed in Germany, that the heir of an
estate, immediately <>n his arrival at borne, for the University vacation, is constituted absolute
Monarch of the house. The idea is, that, by p;>viuu a jouth uncontrolled liberty for a few hours,
to indulge in al! his wishes, whims, and fancies, a more perfect acquaintance may be made with
his ehaiactcr, fo'bies, and secret inclinations, than could possibly be acquired bv ages of observation otherwise.— I he Author himself has stated in his preface that, " the national custom,
which forms the subject of this piece, has been dramatized, both on the German and French
stages, with oonsmerabie < fi'ect. It was put into its present shape for the purpose of legitimately
displajing the talents of that very extraordinary little boy. MASTER BUBKE, in the character of
I'irior J'liyel, which he sustained in a stjle of excellence that would not have discredited the
elTorts of the most txpei i<'iieed actor on the stage."

Positively the Last Night
Of the Company's Performing- this Season, and Last appearance of
M A S T E R B U R K E IN
HULL.
On SATURDAY

Evening,

26th September,

1829,

Will be performed, a Dramatic Anecdote, founded on an interesting Nautical Tale, and adapted
to the Stage, expressly for Master BURKE, called

W I L L BLOCK;
OR, A SEASIAN'S

HEART.

T H E Eccentricites of a very distinguished Naval Commander, have furnished the matter of
this Dramatic sketch.—The Daughter of a Brother Officer, seduced by the Admiral's Nephew
and Heir, is accidentally encountered by the Hero of the Piece, in one of those "cruises," which
the adventurous spirit of his profession, and the natural benevolence of his heart, had made
matter of custom with him.
Jn announcements of this nature, anticipation is forbidden, but
it is presumed, that the incidents arising from this Rencontrej and the display of character it
induces, have formed a very interesting and effective Drama, which is now, (for the first time,)
respectfully submitted to the judgment of a candid aud enlightened audience.

SURRENDER OF

CALAIS.

In this Drama are comprised Tragedy, Comedy, Opera, and some degree of Farce; yet so
happily is Ibe variety blended, that one scene never diminishes the interest of another, but they
all combine to produce a most valuable composition.—Edward Third after the battle of Crcssy,
laid siege to Calais, made his approaches and attacks without intermission, but the Citizens
were obstinate in repelling all his efforts; at length famine did more for Edward then arms, be
issued orders if they meant to save their City, they must send him six of their principal Citizens
with

NECKS,

tendering the City Keys; six men who prized virtue dearer than tile, voluntarily offered up
their inestimable heads to PRESERVE T H E I R COUNTRY:

A SOLEMN

CITIZENS

TO

EXECUTION!

Queen Phillipa intercedes with Edward for their preservation, convinces him the stage on which
they would suffer, would be to them a staee of honour, but a stage of shame to Edward, and a"
indelible disgrace to the HONOUR O F T H E E N G L I S H NATION.—That nothing now remained of leaving him a share in the glory of this action save that of granting an indispensable
pardon to this brave but little

BAND OF P A T R I O T S !
T h e highest panegyric that can be pronounced on this Play is—that the SURRENDER OF
CALAIS is considered, by every critic, as tho very best of all the Author's numerous and successful productions ; it presents a most striking

L E S S O N TO

GREATNESS,

shewing, that excellence is not of Blood, of Title, or Station ; that virtue gives a dignity

SUPERIOR

FAREWELL TO T H E YORK CIRCUIT,
BY MR. W. L.

REDE.

Broad Yorkshire, fare-thee-well! fond memory pleads
For merry Wakefield and for smoky Leeds;
Each Leith smack I behold b u t brings to m i n d ,
Whilst on her hull I gaze—Hull left behind.
Farewell t o eyes of b e a u t y , bowls of wine,
Lasses and glasses t h a t I m u s t resign.
Farewell t h e spot where Cummins, it is said,
Tho' he'd T W O Bakers, couldn't make his bread.
Farewell to Hope,* r e n o u n ' d for t a c i t u r n i t y ,
To Ivers, and t h e fiddling fraternity.
An exile now each luckless Actor roams,
Forced to forsake their Hope and quit their Holmes.f
Farewell, old Remington, in praising you
" W i t h o u t a prompter I should know m y cue,"
Where'er I wander I shall joy to find
One half as clever a n d one third as kind.
You'll t h i n k upon us w h e n we've j o u r n e y ' d thence,
Whilst Andrews sits, and rues our parting hence.
Adieu, y o u n g R e m . w i t h odd grimace and queer shove ;
Adieu, t h y friend " last not least," in our Dear-love.
I'll think of ye in Scotia's land, so delly
J o i n ' d with some " reminiscences of K e l l y ; "
Farewell, Jem Garton, where is now a slighter man,
Since rheumatism's t u r n ' d him to a lighter man •'
Adieu dear Mrs. F r e n c h — m a y she remain
An evergreen upon old E b o r ' s plain;
May the York Circuit find her long a lodger,
Saying to Time " that for you, you old Codger."
A n d oh! whilst other names m y verse has sung,
Amid old friends, shall I forget the Young ?
Thou, " J e m " by name and " J e m " by n a t u r e too,
To thee, and Anderton I bid a d i e u :
My Billy, when I hear some tone of wonder.
(Yet b u t t o yours as sneering is to thunder,)
I'll cry " in fond r e g r e t " hence Northern flat,
" How silver sweet" was Billy's tone in t h a t !
Harry, adieu, (a shrewd tho' slim and small boy,)
Born with a caul and therefore made a call-boy:
W e soon shall be where Youngs no more are seen,
Find " Angels visits few and far b e t w e e n ; "
A n d much I fear engagements will so bar her,
That we shall hear no more of Macnamara.
Farewell, then, all, and oh! adieu, adieu,
The stage I've often t r o d — a n d once fell through.
Alas! should fame reveal, none would believe her.
How much we've butcher'd—with
a single C L E A V E R ;
A Cleaver! in the North we shall not match it,
Tho' Reynoldson will thither take his " H A T C H E T : " J.
A Cleaver that despite the victim's sighs, (size,)
Charms as she cuts and wounds—but w i t h her eyes.
Adieu to Collison,§ I k n o w no taller m a n ;
Adieu, John Bailes,|| a w o r t h y t h o ' a smaller man.
Farewell " Professor" Wilson,^! farewell—scene-room.
Dressing-place and wardrobe, stage and green-room.
Long may you flourish, scenes of future mirth,
W h e n I am " a remembrance upon e a r t h , "
W h e n all now r o u n d ye are b y death subdued,
A n d when old Time " the brinded cat hath M U D E . "
