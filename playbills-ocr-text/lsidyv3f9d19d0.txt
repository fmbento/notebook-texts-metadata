DRURY-LANE THEATRE.
On Saturday night this Theatre opened for the season with the usual formality, the anthem of ‘ God, save the King’ being executed by the whole of the operatic corps, and received with the same demonstrations of applause by the audience which they h*ve been long in the habit of manifesting npon such occasions. Some alterations nave been midesince last season which appear to be chiefly, if not entirely, confined to the body of the house. The most remarkable is a change in the form of the orchestra, whieli is now comprised within a semicircle, intruding, of course, in its sweep, upon sonic of the front seats of the pit, hut more than compensating for that disadvantage by facilities and improvements which afford increased effect to the music. Arranged as the orchestra now is, the leader has the double advantage of facing the stage, and having the whole of the band under his eye. The grouping together of the different iuatruments, contributes also to the perfection of the harmony, which may be considered another improvement resulting from this alteration. But perhaps the most important rf all, is the opportunity it has afforded of bringing forward the organ into the orchestra, instead of allowing its notes to be wasted somewhere at the hack of the stage, ns was the case in all oar Theatres, until the present plan was introduced. The pannels of the dress circle have been newly painted, medallions of our celebrated dramatists adorning each alternate box, the others being ornamented with appropriate devices. Over each medallion is inscribed the name of the Dramatist it represents, an expedient which, though necessary to explain portraits so little known to the mass of the public, has a paltry appearance in the very temple of the Drama. Each of the three boxes which stand on either side of the stage lias been newly painted. Their fronts are now a deep green. Why they should be different in colour from any other boxes we know not, but the effect is bad. ft destroys the harmony of the colonriog, and by such an abrupt transition ftom tbe light character of the other decorations interferes with the general effect. There may be some other alterations of minor importance. We have noticed the most proimnenr«itowever, observing only with respect to the appearance of the house, that it is, notwithstanding the green and sombre sbadi which is thrown npon it in one part, a light and beautiful object. With respect to the performances we have not much £» say. The first was the romantic drama ef Fan-stus. We did not expect to have seen this piece put forwaid at the beginning of the campaign, after the experience of the former season, when it was certainly exhibited without any violent demand on the part of the public for its repetition, ltseems, however, that we are to have more of it. Our attention was only called to it by the change which lias taken place in one of the principal characters. Mr. J. Kusivll having made bis first aripearaiicc at this Theatre aa Aliphisia-phiUt, the part originally performed by Mr. Ttunr.
with that heartiness of welcome which is alwaja cheerfully awarded to an actor of his fine talents. The play was The ATerry Wives of Windsor, interspersed with music; and Mr. Dowien again essayed the very difficult character of Falstaff— most difficult, we should have said, for, we believe, no man, having a true relish for Shakspeare, ever perused the character of the facetious knight—that concoction (In no small space, certainly) of various whimsical and laughable humour*— without forming a beau ideal picture of the ancient debauchee, which the effort* of no human being could realne. Laying our closet remembrances aside, Mr. Vow too plays the part well. Hia description of the purgatory of the back-basket It as rich and aa uncuous as the napkin* is the midst of which the adventurous soldier in the wars of intrigue was borne to an unwelcome cold-bath. His nolens talent penitence was good. Falstaff was defeated by circumstance»? but the “ lurking devil” leering in Do »ton’s eye told both wife and husband that he doubted not to overcome die virtue of the one. and the vigilance of the other. Matter Slender waa pleasantly represented by Harley. Since we last saw him, he has mellowed in the port. When he first appeared as Slendt r he was somewhat too lively both in hia speech and motion. He la now, after the manner of Ben Jooson’s Master Stephen, more melancholic aad gentlemanlike. Wallack is very well, while Ford in a mere level speaker ; he introduces himself, for instance, with much adroitness to Fatstof; but when his suspicions are confirmed, when Ford feels (albeit falsely) that he is dishonoured, his aeting did net keep pace with the interest of the scene. It wa» outrageous, not’natural. Mr. Horn's Fenton compelled us to offer up many prayer* for the return of Mr. Brahirr.; and although Hiss Graddon rings pleasingly, many a day must elapse before she can eradicate from our minus the thrilling melody of Miss Stephens, who originally executed the music attached to the character of Mrs. Fori, The house was tolerably well attended.

fj D*JaY-LAWE Theatbe.—The monstrosities ef Orr Freuchutz were last night again brought before the pub. lie. The audience was very numerous, and appeared to be highly delighted with the incomprehensible " devilries” of the German fabulist. The extravaganza of The Dfvil tc Pay followed. This is certainly too much of magic for one evening ; and, had not Dowton represented JobtOR , and Mrs. Davison appeared in the chaiacter of .Vetf, we fear that the antiquity of thia very absurd and stupid farce would nothavesnved it, from late, but just damnation. On ihisoecasion, Mrs. Davison made her first appeannceo.n these boards, after an absence of very great length from the metropolitan boards. Her reception was most gracious, and her performance of the cobbler’s wife, half sulky and half good-natured, proved that shode-served every plaudit that was bestowed on her. Dowton’s JnbeoH is a piece of sterling humour. We were almost in. dined te exclaim, at the termination of his performance, so greatly did it please us, “ jVe sntor ultra crepidam /”

LRVRY-LANE THEATRE.
Colman’s agreeable comedy of The Heir at Law * was performed, on Saturday night, to a remarkably scanty audience. The bills declared that the piece was selected “ by particular desire," but why it should have been selected, we cannot conceive. It could not be on account of the manner in which the play was east; for a greater portion of ineffisiency we have not often seen assembled within the compass of a single drama. Mr. Dowton, who appeared as the Chandler-Lord, is, of course, an exception to this general censure. The broad vulgarity, and, at the same tinie,J the honest bluntness of the character, were described in the most striking and ludicrous manner. It was an excellent performance, deriving no part of its effect from grimace :	the whole of Mr. Dowton’s,
performance was subdued and quiet, lie appeared unconscious that there was an audience before him—and, in proportion to his abstraction from all, save the immediate business ef the scene, dul his efforts corn muni-cate mirth and pleasure. Mrs.H arlowe’s LadyDubtrly has much merit. It is, however, a little too coarse and boisterous even for her suddenly-exalted ladyship. Mr.'J. Russell, to our great annoyance, took the character of Zekiel Homespun. We congratulate him on the admirable condition of his lungs, but we con- . fess it would have pleased us much had we been absent from Saturday night’s display of their capacity.
ITbis gentleman has been long enough acquainted with the stage to know, that strong passion may be expressed without absolutely “ splitting the ears" of an audience. Mr. Knight, who we are sorry to learn is seriously ill, played the character in a very*different and certainly in an infinitely better manner. Mr. J. Russell must have seen him, and if lie would ponder a little on that gentleman’s performance, and, without absolutely imitating him, would endeavour to adopt the sober, yet feeling tone by which Knight’s Zekiel H vmespun was distinguished, it would be a very gTeat improvement. Miss 1. Paton sustained the pari of Cicely Homespun. Simplicity, kindheartedness, and an utter absence of affectation, are the sole characteristics of this innocent village girl. Miss Paton quite mistook the character. No fine lady ever was, or could be, more entirely under the influence of affectation. It induced her to clip the King’s English, and to constrain her every action and motion. Mr. Harley's Dr. Pangloss is well known. His looks are somewhat too youthful for the pedantic tutor; but his lively performance leaves us little time to criticise his appearance. After the play, O’Keefe’s wretched farce of The Son-in-Law was performed. This piece has for a lung series of years slumbered on the prompter’s shelf, and it was on this occasion revived for the unworthy purpose of placing Mr. J. Russell in the character of Signer Arionelli—it being pretty generally known that he would in that character introduce imitations of Velluti, as Mr. C. Bannister formerly had done of Tvnducci. Acting on a manly, intelligible, English feeling, we certainly opposed the appearance of SignorVelluti in this country. Towards the individual we did not, and could not, harbour any dislike. We combatted for principle—we had no wish to insult misfortune ; but on Saturday night we felt ashamed and disgusted when Velluti’s peculiarity of voice, arising from a practice that cannot be too much condemned, was brought forward as a subject ef imitation—as a matter of amusement—as a theme of ridicule. The experiment has, however, failed. The squeaking of Mr. J. Russell, as well as certain indelicate allusions, which, as Signor A riant III, he had to deliver, were, after the surprise of the moment had abated, most heartily hissed. We were glad to see the galleries exceedingly active in manifesting their disapprobation. The feeling is a most just one; Esto perpetva.
BHVR Y-LtANP.
The Heir at Law was performed at this theatre on Saturday nlrflt, and if the Daniel nomine at Dotrton bad not the rich: grotesque an-mour that we have bee» accustomed to In Liston» yet, on the whole, it waa a rerv good performance. There is something in this actor that always 'pleases, though he may not be exactly placed 1« the character suitable to bis peculiar genius. The DoctorPanglou of Harley is of an e/lremely hupioorous description- The Caroline Dormer of Miss Smithson wanted sdul. That young lady ha* a pleasing physiognomy and a good lignre, and speaks her word» out tolerably plain, but she wants genius. Wise I. Paton played Cicely .Homespun very well ■, but we would recommend thjs yooBg lady In certain words and passages not to i e-quite bo pointed. The greatest charm appertaining to woman is delicacy» the contrary, though U may raise a laugh for the moment, is not liked by even the most indelicately kScllrfed
on refiectlon. The new Military tJMvertlsemen t. The Canip. is .ofan exfrernely pleasing description, and went off with much eclat. The
dancing is Terr prettV throughout, and being dlvendiied, passed off* much to the satisfaction of the aodieuce. The dancing of Mr. and Mrs. Noble, in the petond dance, was very diverting, and well executed ; but the formal minuet might os well be Emitted, and rorae-thioK more lively substituted- The Son-in-Law followed, is wh.ch Mr. Russell gave some admirable Imitations cf Vellati, but we would recommend Mr- lElliston’s mjo to cause nearly the whole of the dialogue to be omitted. We observed one party of ladle« leave a box. In justice, however, to Mr. Eilutoos son, it sboald be stated that the management of the stage and orchestra i» well attended to. The band are very prop^ly kept at their duty between the acta, a»d there is none, of the usual tedious* ness of waiting between the play and afterpieces. Owing to such attention, though tber-i were three pieces, on Saturday night, ths performances were over »littie after eleven. ThU Is aa it should be. The Bcwkitt of Harley in this piece Is beyond all praise—be skipped and danced, and grimaced the chnracter In the most farcical style imaginable. The Orator Mum, by Mr. O. Smith, was very well played. His haute, look, and tone of voice, were all conformable.— The house was pretty well filled, but not so much so as jf the fsshiomible absent.sea were in town. But Mr. M'Culloch would say lust such absence made no difference in a Dmry-laue treasury ‘policies! economical Report, j but whether Mr, Dunn, the treasurer, nr, whether the Drury Jane proprietors, or Mr- BttVston, the lessee, will agree In opinion with Mr. hDCuHocb, so Car as Drury-4ane is concerned, we will leave them to determine._

The Manager put forlh last nigi? a large portion pf the strength of "*s company for the ensuing season. The play chosen for the intro--‘*:»n of, at least, three nfw performers on these boards, was the dy of The Road to Ruin, a play which, for its moral, in these I of ruinous gambling, might be frequently repeated —~““
, some good effect. The part of Old Dornton was -William«, late from one of the country theatres.
1 his profession, he has attained a respectable pro shows a capability of conceiving rightly, and •dgly, the character assigned to him. His destinati Mitre seems to be, to supply the place of Mr. Terry, an constantly reminds the spectator of that excellent performi V the chief faults we found In his performance last night was, »eared more intent on imitating TeTry than acting Old, i materials enough within himself, and needs no model, r study of the part set down for him. Another first apj i was made by a Mr. W. Beimstt in the part of Sulky. ained the character with propriety, and his stern integi e amiable, as it was certainly more natural, in the last ac ntleman, too, promises to be an acquisition to the company, greatest support—the greatest ornament to this or any other com, is Miss Keliy—most simple, most natural, most affecting. She ed last night in the interesting character of Sophia (her first ance here these three years), and her entrance at the beginning .........1	'*	~	' ise simul*

and smoothed down the hand of Young Dornton with sinconscious of the act, but dwelling on it with ford del aorry to leave off to answer her mother's call. Her""''!"® particle of the broken Valentine, after her expressed	„
to grandmamma “down to Gloucestershire,” and hate 'Dornton and all mankind “ for his sake,” was another touch which every one felt to be as simple and natural as it was affecting. Mr. Wallack was—for the first time at this house—the Barry Dornton, and he acted the part with good judgment and true feeling. Mrs. Davidson looked and dressed, and acted the Widow Warren in excellent style. Her fine figure, and comparatively youthful appearance, would make any xnan qf less heart than Harry Dornton forget poor Sophia in reality. Mr. Gattie, Mr. Harley, aud Mrs. Orger, well sustained the fa-vonrable opinion that has been long entertained of their performance. In the melndrame of Bllm Rosenberg, which followed the comedy, Miss Kelly, as Ella Rosenberg, had an opportunity of showing that ishe is as capable of representing the deep distress and the sublime «sentiment of tragedy, as well as the amiable playfulness of comedy— whether ia joy or in trouble, happy or miserable, she possesses she art of making every heart sympathise with her. In this latter piece Mr. Tayleure appeared, fof the first time here, as the Bur-
Iomaster Plutterman, and his performance seemed to give mch satisfaction. Mr. Dowton1« Storm was much applauded. The company was respectable, and the house well tilled. We were pleased with the charming overture of Rossini, and hope the raana ger will always regale us with sneb a feast.

DRURY-LAISE THEATRE.
— <m -
Last night was represented the tragic play of Pixarro—xfch In pic-ique scenery and in charming music, -but richer still in the ele-language with which, to an exuberaoce, Mr. Sheridan clothed nakedness of its incidents. Mr. Wall&ck personated the brave * with energy and judgment enbugh up to the moment of his n event which strips the wisest of their wisdom, address to the soldiers, which was copied almost literally by the author or translator of this play from a speech which a Roman historian makes Cataline speak on a similar occasion, was pronounced by Ills representative last night with just emphasis and good taste, except that there was some little inclination to rant. The scene that follows soon after, in which he pursues his recreant warriors, and ral.ies them again to tho light, was executed with fine effect, {and so also was that In which Holla rescues Alamo's child, threatening " death on the spot to him who
gored one step to loilow him.’* Bat Mr. Wallack, while imploring ixarro to spare tbo child, would do well to fling himself on his knees at once, and spare that silly attempt after effect by a stage trick in going on one kcee, rising again and looking around as if to see if any body looked ou, or as if ashamed of the act, and. then flinging himself at Pixan‘o'8 feet. This refinement is quite unbecoming the character. In the last scene again there was a more laboured, and, certainly a dangerous effort “ to die quietly.” After g.ving the child to Cora's arms Mr, Wallack falls lifeless, but is roused by Cora*s exclamation that there was blood on the child. He then rises on his legs as straight as a maypole, as quivering too, and with great adroitness falls ' ily on his back. The mode of managing the matter is, we believe, ! new; the easiest way, and the most natural also, was to expire r the first fall. The character of Elvira was well sustained by . Bure. The play was followed by the gorgeous melodrame of Va-and Orson -, Valentine by Mr. Penley, and Orson by Mr. O. Mr Penley went though the pantomime of his part very .utthe tediousness Of his flourishes was a great tax on the . nee of the audience; many of whom, Hke ourselves, were tired before the first act waa over: briskness is the soul of such representations.

THEATRICAL EXAMINER.auMft)
As we reserved ourselves for an inspection of the merits of Mr Booth in Richard III, we insert the following communication from an intelligent correspondent; with whose sentiments (setting aside the specific performance described, which we did not see) we generally agree. Kean has undoubtedly succumbed to personal and party enmity, fighting under the masked battery of morality. Recklessly supplying some of the most mean and merciless of mankind with materials which operate on the honest feelings of the great number, who are much more versed in appearances than in principles, he has been driven from the British stage by a species of jargon, insidiously and
unfairly connecting conduct with talents; and implying a deficiency of ^ uuvc V1	w
the one from the imprudence of the other. Should his Grace of other hand he was much more '.\armiy applauded. Wxllingttjn once more take thefield, it would be quite as reasonable	....
‘	' grand moral
to impeach his soldierly abilities, in compliment to the _ lessons" contained in the disclosures of Miss Harriette Wilson With respect to the observations of our correspondent, on the scenic and mechanical department of this theatre, we can only observe, that the faults complained of occitr too frequently to be concealed, and obviously arising (as he justly adds) from any thing but niggardliness; to mention u, in addition to being a public duty, is rather friendly than otherwise:—v	'	-.	.
■	.	Drury Lane.
On Saturday the 8th, Mr Boommadehis second debut on the London boards, after a professional residence of Some years in America, whither he retired from a stormy opposition that was raised againsthim on account of his vaccilla ting conduct respecting an engagement, by which, owing to some manoeuvring (not to say juggling), on the part of one or other bouse, both claimed him as their servant. Mi Booth at that rime f . was very young; and 1 always thought that, for want perhaps of a mature decision on his own part, he fell a sacrifice to the carte-and-tierce policy of the rival houses. * Mr Booth acted perfectly right in leaving the country, bnt .perhaps be has been equally judicious in stepping into Mi Kean’S shoes—who, by the way, should have kept his ground, am^sliown bis contempt for those people who in the same breath hooted atm and applauded Miss Foote. Mr Kean triumphed over one vulgar bullying antagonist, and would in rime have shut the mouth of the other.—Tp pass on to the subiect of the present article :
Mr Booth selected the pan of Brutus in Mr Howard .Payne’s Tragedy of that name; but before an opinion can be safely pro-■aanciri aa to bis dance of permanent success, he must be seen in some characters of greater merit and interest. In the present instance, nearly the whole specimen is satisfactory; and parts of the performance were highly gratifying. Some of the daily critics have complained of his “ ranting" in the scene where he curses Tarquinius. Under such an excitement he tfundd rant; and if, in addition, he could have torn the ground from under the ravisher, he would not have outraged the dictates of nature. Any delivery short of a “ whirlwind of passion’’ would, in such a cause, have been tameness.
“ Tbe last scene of aH” was the touchstone of the character; and some portions of that scene were Tery powerfully given. It is useless attempting to detract from his merit, by calling him a disciple in the school of Kean : he it so; bathe is not his mimic. He is in short an able man : and doubtless, if permanently engaged, would prove an acquisition to the theatre. There seems to be a lameutable want of energy in the management at this house. Tbe mob were as orderly as a congregation of iamishad- methodms. The gates of Rome were pushed down Hy Mr Elltston’s livery servant, and not a citizen presented himself to convey a hint that the dilapidation was efiboted by an infuriate mob; a few soldiers, it is true, walked in, after a decent pause, in “ orderly time ;v while a little red fire flickered in one corner of the stage, as ifblushing to be mistaken for a conflagration. A squib, vice a thunderbolt, which was ordained to knock old Tarquin off his perch, fizzed its “ ineffuctugl^re,” and the afore-mentioned livery servant was despatched to elbow the stony old Roman off his horse. I have no desire to insinuate an invidious comparison, but to rouse the managers by thrusting a good example before them, in observing the superior management ef these matters at Covent Garden. Even the enemies of tbe Drury Lane establishment (if they have any, and I cannot see why they should) will not charge them with niggardliness, for they are frequently profuse; but their “ operatives” in the scenic department sadly want either skill, promptitude, or efficient superintendence: and the omission should be looked to. We will Hot close this article without adding our decided approbation of Mr • Boom's modesty,, good sense, and transatlantic sturdiness, “ in declining the honourr’ of being called out, to come and put his hand to ha heart, and bow six and thirty times because he had done his best, and had played well.	• • <
We attended tbe second appearance of Mr Booth, on Thursday «»«ung, in the arduous representation of Richard III. Brought into close comparison with an actor who has so decidedly made tna,t character his own, the object as well as the ambition of the attempt is obvious; and regarding it in this point of view alone, it forcibly reminds us of the Icarian flight spoken of in the play itself. In common candour, however, it ought not to be thus exclusively considered. Kean having been driven from the stage by Morality—Ok Sheridan, of what a large class is thy Joseph Surface the representative 1— it is reasonable that his place be filled by as much kindred talent as can be procured; and Mr Booth undoubtedly possesses sufficient abilities to become a candidate on the occasion. His performance of this evening was generally respectable, occasionally very happy, and sometimes, we think, in the approach after novelty, misconceptive.
He evidently laid by in the first three acts, with a view to be more adequate to the two remaining ones ; and in consequence a. something of tameness was fo.vsornc rime apparent, which straDgely contrasted with tbe accusaUon of rant on the preceding Saturday. His scene with Lady Aunt was good, but we must not think of Kean at the time; and every now and then some very happy hits were made; but on the whole the performance wanted a stronger general stamen. In the tent and combat scene Mr Booth displayed considerable energy,
disfigured only now and ihen by those rocks in the way of candidate tragedians, enutied “ new readings.” This able actor, for certainly he may be called so, is however very unfortunate in his position with regard to Kean : if he imitate h;m he is an imitator, if not, then he is not Kean. It appears to us, in regard to this alleged imitation, that much of it is owing to his embracing the theoretic style of the expatriated actor, rather than to an imitation of his specific performance; and that the involuntary resemblance is still more aided by a person and voice exhibiting similar peculiarities and deficiencies, in a more eminent degree. We might illustrate our observation by comparing several passages in Richard in which they resemble, and others in which they difit ; but as it appears that Mr Booth is not permanently engaged at this house, it is scarcely necessary. On the present occemod he met once or twice with a slight mark of disapprobation, bat on tbe ■■fpMrip Having admitted a little censure on some scenic defects in a previous performance, it ! is but justice to observe that nothing could be better managed than this department on the present occasion, or be .more beautiful ami ] appropriate thau the scenery assigned to Richard III at Drury h3ns.
DRURY r.ANE THRATRK
Last light was performed the tragedy of King Richard the Third— Dot exactly the pray which, under that naate.we read in the ordinary 01 appro—-1 editions of Shahspcsre’S djQ:?nst|p. works, but an adapta-tlodofit, with considerable currallmetlhf and transposition*, and even some additions. It is one cf the characteristics of tb.s great author’s histories Of the lives and deaths of oar English Kings that they are divisible almost aft pleasure, amt each part still forme na !h-tegral dramatic piece. So Richard the Third of last night began, not with Oldster's soliloquy- “ Now is the winter of Qnr discontent,” Ac., but with two or three scer.es from the last Act of The Third Part of Henrp the Sixth. This transfer may be considered no amendment, ha without it many persons not acquainted with the pretedlng play, would be at' a loss to comprehend come of thts play. Mr. Booth acted the Duke of Bluster. He was rseeivsd, 'is ys bis Nest appearance on Saturday, with moderate apnlause .by a respectable, hut not a fnli house. He did not, ai most of Blotter's representatives do. take pains to raise a grotesque excrescence in tbe iegor hack—> both aoernetl to us of their natural shape; amt therefore r, e thought that his reflections on these his defoimtties were not quite appro
iiei ____ . _	. .....
□other incongruity that struck ns was, tt at in the beginning of the scene with Lady Anne, when the foneral procession of Henrg the Sixth halts an the stage, Mr. itooth repeats his mandats to the hearers to stop, while they were all standing stock still. Their not attempting to move was certainly their faulti and notMr. Booth’s. His courtship sf the lady was bold and effective. , In his performance of the subsequent scenes up to tbe endof the fo»rlh«ct,Jnclading even the tent scene, there was no one effort that soared above mediocrity.—' The last scene »f the fourth set, when news was brought of Rucking-
s’s going over to Richmond’s party, was acted wifi i the whole of the fifth act. The last scene,
great energy, the fight with
as was the whole oi tne nrm act. me last scene, and w _________
Richmond, was neither so long nor so vldieot, tot so great a display of swoidsmaasbip. a» w* have often witnessed, but still It was well executed. Mr. wallack performed in a respectable manner the litu ' that Richmond had to do The meiodrame ot Valentine uni Orsm followed, and drew all the loungers in from the saloon and tbe lobbies. It promises to become, as it merits tobe, particularly by the gorgeonansss of the dressed and scenery, a very attractive piece.

THEATRICAL EXAMINER.'
Druhy Lake.
The grandest theatrical treat perhaps we ever had, was -on that famous evening when Messrs Kean and Booth played in conjunction. The former the part of Othello, the latter that of logo; and we never recur to the effect that exhibition produced on us without wishing that the whole world could have been spectators. Mr Booth was brought out as a competitor with Mr Kean : their equal height and similar style of performing provoked comparison. Here then was the opportunity, when they came foot to foot, for Kean to show the great inequality of the powers of the two men; and this he did by an effort—an (as it were) intellectual bound, which must have satisfied every spectator then present, that competition was out of the question:—and, with all the wonderful colouring of that performance as fresh in our minds as if it were at this moment an embodied painting by Titian, we are compelled to say, that if Mr Booth on this re-appearance has intended to fill up the chasm left by Mr Kean’s retreat, he has greatly overrated his own powers. By the plain and unequivocal manner in which we have spoken of this disproportion in the two actors, let not Mr Booth charge us with unfairness; we are so far from feeling anything like prejudice against him, that indeed our inclination is to his advantage. There, were many touches the other evening which lead us to think of his understanding with more than common respect—though the result of our opinion of the performance as a whole, is, that it wanted power. The speech before the senate wa9 delivered off hand, as if he had learned it by rote; not as if it were the spontaneous effort of one who felt that he could “ little grace his cause in speaking for himself,” The third act—the memorable and most trying part of the character, went off rather tamely. But the last scene was by far the best of the whole performance; and our impression is, that it was nearly as well as we ever saw it played. We still say that Mr Booth will benefit the establishment—that we hope he may be offered an engagement to his advantage; and we wish him success in the public favour.
Wallace played some parts of logo very creditably: so did Brown the difficult character of Roderigo: for it is difficult to convey the discrimination between weakness of understanding and sheer fatuity; which latter quality, as it is more gross and palpable to common eyes, so is it the favourite reading of the character by common actors. Penley’s Cossio was sad work. Mrs West made a tolerably good Dendemona, and evidently exerted herself to do her best. And last, Mrs Bunn was respectable in Emilia. This lady has a fine and commanding person. Does she stoop on purpose to detract from her height of stature; and does she imagine that she appears uncouthly tall? If so, she only changes hands, and transfers the uncouthness from her stature to her carriage.	• * *
We may observe, in addition to the above favour from a Corre, spondent, that Mr Booth, m expressing some very natural and well-grounded resentment at certain mean and false attempts to lower his private character, seems inclined to go to war with the newspapers in general. That an actor’s opinion of his own merits should differ from those of other people, is no way surprising, and must pass; but the other sort of injury is as base, perishable and malignant, as the quarter whence it chiefly emanates. It was quite amusing to read the John Bull of Sunday last, in reference to Mr W a rde, from whose merits and respectability we have no sort of disposition to deteriorate ; but it is quite absurd to exalt level acting in the abstract beyond exalted genius; and, in talking of histrionic talent, to be formally alluding to private character. This sermonising in reference to the subject, is monstrous twaddle at best, and, if carried higher, would at once be • ' • found so by John himself. Prom the Treasurer of the Mauritius, it is indeed the sublime of the ridiculous,—the very negro girl« of that island would smile at iU.

'	DRU RELAMÍ.
The Comedy of Love for Love wag revived last night after nine years of qniet unbroken slumbers. Congrave had written this, and two, at least, of his other playa, before he arrived at the age of twenty-three. His yf.uth, and the secluded life of a student In the Temple, precluded him from any deep or extended acquaintance with men and manners. He drew his characters from the only sources lie had—his imagination, and what he knew of life through books. It is not, therefore, wonderful that they should be for the moat part, fictitioua. and artificial, very little of commun manee1 i-H- of nlrtnfa! humour entering i nto their composition. He was equally unhappy In the contriving of his plots, and lu the iuveiUion of striking or diverting incident*. Fot these déficiences he made amends—as well as amends could be so made—by an elaborateness of dialogue and incessant clash of wit, neither flowing from the occasion nor dictate 1 by nature. Hia personages are truly said to be " intellectual gladiators, evarv sentence •f them being intended to strike, or ward off, a blow.* The comedy played last night cornea nearer to real life, and exhibits more of the manners of his time than either his Old Bachelor or The Double Dealer. The character of Foreeight was one not at all uncommon in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Dryden, they say, calculated nativities, Cromwell had his lucky day, and utither William the Third nor the Earl of Shaftesbury wanted faith in the predictions of the aetrologera. The age for that boasted and vain pretence to science has passed away, and Foresight is now a mere driveller, without the merit even of making one laugh at him. That character was played last sight by Mr. Williams, who did all that a man, who never saw—never, perhaps, conceived such a personage, nor anything like him, could do, without, however, succeed, ingln making him an object of pity or ridicule, of hatred or affection. He came and retired unexpected and unregarded.—Mr. Wailack personated Valentine— but whether well or 111, It is difficult to say j because there is no standard Is nature, with which we are acquainted, to| bring him to aa a test, by which we could try the correct, ness of the delineation. Be counterfeits madness for the purpose of avoiding a deed, which bit father required him to sign In favour of a younger brother. This madness, assumed without sufficient cause, is continued without any justifying necessity through a whole tedious act, to the exclusion ef every thing like bu-motrr, or Interest, or passion , a« well as to the diffusion of ennui among the aadiepee , and it is only to /keep a wife that he parte with his fit of lunacy. Mr. Powton played the father. Sir Sampeon Legend, tvho take« all the trouble in the world to disinherit the eldest son Valentine, without showing cause why, to leave his estates to a booby of a second son, who return* from sea. This said Ben, the sailor, was personated pleasantly enough by Mr. Harley, who does well whatever he undertake» But he wae working against the grain In thia Ben, who la a roost unnatural character, having not the affections of a brother, nor the gallantry nor generosity of a sailor Miss Kelly played the hoyden, who Is made to fall ia Lve with one man who cares nothing about her, and, after r^Jectiag another who cares leas, makes her exit from the stage nobody kaowa whither. Mrs. Davison represented Angelito, a fair laky, who, in love with the eon, consents to marry the father, but when lha former lays aside his assumed madness, then shakes off the father, and marrlas the son.— Mrs. Yates and Mrs. Orger sustained the characters of Mrs. Frail and Mrs. Foresight, two sisters, who, in language not to be misunderstood, proclaim their intrigues and their infamy. One of them at length, to consummate thla tissue of nonatural combinations,, artificial characters, and absurd plots, Is married in mask to a faithless fop intltled Tattle, played by Mr. Browne. All those performers whose names we have mentioned, and the others whose names are omitted, acted their respective parts with their usual cleverness, but they certainly f without any fault on tbelr part) failed In delighting or instructing the audience. The indelicacy of the allusions, and pa,pable indecency of some of the dialogue, drew down a solitary laugh frem the upper part of the house. We never saw any comedy go off mere languidly, aad vre were therefore surprised on hearing it given out for repetition on Thursday next. The announcement was received with partial disapprobation. We are inclined to think that the stage manager mistook for approbation of the play the kind applause which the audience beatowed on himself, on Mr. Dowton, M sj Kelly, and the other performers personally. We ate also inclined to the opinion that this or any other of Congrève’» comedies excited admiration in his own time, not from any merit inherent in themselves, but because tbev were the productions of a very young man before he had opportunities of being familiar with the vices or vanities, the abaur'fttica or cunning of men, a thorough acquaintance with all of which was deemed neceas ary for the composition of a good play.

This is one of there di iil flay*, at U« Tvpr^tMUit#« vTwMch one finds J$ necessary to uke «»ufT, and eveu piach his nose occasionally in order to keep hiras-Uf from doting« A* It U a thing seldom played, and seldom read, i* may not be impertinent to inform our readers that the whole plot '.is founded on a stolen or misplaced portmanteau, out of which the; ingenuity of the author wrought life long acta, relieved with a few in teresting occurrences. The owner of this portmanteau, Don Phaliip, rejected by one lady, goes by command of his father or an e::pedifon to woo another, carrying in It his money and letters of irat roduclion. Hypolila, the lady who i ejected him—not from hate, but woman’s caprice, repenting of having said “nay,” and regretting ilia* Don Philip did not construe it “ yea,” resolves to repair the fairlt. Her first object is to prevent his marrying another; she gets possession of the portmanteau, takes the letters, and putting herstelf ip male attire, wiln her confidante. Flora, 8irailarly decorated, postooff to Madrid, and before Don Philip arrives, presents her credentials to Don Manuel, who. welcomes her as the supposed ¿on of bis old friend, and introduces her to his daughter Rosara. This lady is in love with one Octavio, who appears to he the brother of this nw comer, and who is forbidden the house by «the father. Learning tbe secret from Hypo/ita, Rosara listens to her addresses, and they make short work of tbe often tedious ceremony of courtship. When Don Philip ar rives, he is, of course rejected i.s an impostor. After many insults and repulses, he satisfies DonJd anuel that the favoured suitor is au impostor, and he himself was the real Don Philip. Hypolita releases Rosarn on condition thut tbe old father consented to her union with | Octario. This beijoe granted, Hypo lit u confesses, and craves mercy of Don Philip, for having so long teased him ; he is satisfied with her hand as an atone ment. Miss Kelly played the part of Hvpolita and though she wore the breeches In a manner free and unconstrained enpnl ?h, yet her performance in it did not produce that satisfact ion and (that sympathy which she is wont to do in more ca ngenial characters. Hypolita is net only an unenviable character tin b^self, bat she Is positively a bad one. She undergoes a transformation from mere caprice, and carries on the disguise by fraud, and lying, and swearing, and bully ing, without any urging or corresponding cau-e. On her introduction to Rosara, Miss Kelly sang aisweet song with excsllent feeling, and was moch applauded. Mr. Dowton acted the stupid father, Don Manuel, with his usual cleverness- With infinite humour did lie represent the old fellow’s extravagant and Idiot-like joy on finding Rosara smitten with the supposed Don Philip. With equal succe*s did he show off his extravagant sorrow In discovering Don Philip to be an impostor. Some might think he dwelt too long on, and overacted these parts. Trapp anti, a lying varlet, rery instrumental in forwarding the plot, wav not the least entertaining personage in the play *, he was ably represented by Mr. Harley. Vilette, tbe counterpart of Trappaiiti, was played by Mrs. Davison,1 and certainly those two characters weTe never better performed. A similarity of disposition and of pnrsuit—namely, lying and cheating from pure love of gold—brought them acquainted, and the acquaintance eudt in a marriage. In the whole of this comedy there is little wit and less sentiment. Contrary to all probability, neither Octavio recognises bis sister, nor the real Don Philip his mistress in the mock Don Phi-
lip until she ezpl all this compos!tloi which is, after all
laittn he lorfW fr bin o
herself in the last scene. The great end which fraud and folly is intended to gain, is a moral
_	obscurely exhibited—that is, to show by the
coBtfnct of Don Man ait. In refusing Octavio as a son-in-law, how the sordid ness of a parent may bring rain on himself and his child. This is another of those new revivals, in the success of which we cannot congratulate the managers.

On Thursday evening1, Congreve's Love for Love was revived at this theatre, being the only comedy of that author which the externals of modern morality will away with; and even in this particular in* stance it has been found necessary to use the pruning knife very freely. It is trite now to dwell upon the dramatic character of Congreve, to expatiate upon his exuberance and misapplication of wit, or upon his inheritance of no small portion of the licence of his predecessors in the glorious days of Charles II, with whom indeed he was joined by Jeeemt Collier, in the celebrated attack of the latter on the stage. His profuse supply of wit to the whole of his dramatis person« ¡3 doubtless a dramatic fault, but one which may be pardoned for its rarity. Pope exclaimed—	■
“ Tell me if Congreve’s fools are fools indeed.**
With respect to more modern creations of this description, it is frequently necessary to enquire if they are anything else. A less answerable objection to Congreve, is the want of nature and probability in his plots and characters, in which, as in his licence, he grafts too much of the reprobate complexion of the era which followed the Restoration. Rising into life as that deluge of licentiousness began to abate, and writing while very young, he formed his notions of town-bred intercourse rather from the writings of his predecessors, than from his own observation or experience. He also began to dramatize al a period when the artificial Gallic surface given to English manners, by the return of Charles, and which even operated to coxcombify honest Pepts, began to give way to the reappearance of the native ore. These joint causes produced some coldness to his later pieces even in his own day; and they are still move felt by a modern audience. In fact, as it has been very judiciously observed, nothing can be really more unlike the conversational display of English rank and fashion, than the gay and piquant wit, satire, and allusion of the Congreve school. While the improved aspecf of the morale of this class excludes its coarseness in one particular, we apprehend that they are by no moans in the habit of emulating his carte-and-tierce brilliancy in the other; not to mention, that this tone of conversation was never national anywhere out of France. Added to all the rest, Love for Love, as a revival, has to cope with the great size of modern theatres; owing to which, wit, repartee, and equivoque, especially in the mouth of females, are lost to half the audience. It is this circumstance, and the predominant character of the audiences consequent upon it, which render what has not very happily been termed genteel comedy so rare of late, both in production and performance. On Thursday evening, the comedy of Love fur Love was, upon the whole, well performed. The Valentine of Wallace wanted a little more piquancy and spirituality in the assumed madness, but we look for considerable improvement and facility in this respect on repetition. The Str Sampson legend of Dowton, it is unnecessary to say, was excellent. In fathers of the Absolute class, he is always at home; and in the character of Sir Sampson, including that of a chuckling inamorato of sixty also, this forcible comedian was doubly in his own element. Mr Williams, the new performer, undertook Foresight, and as usual gave us a copy of Murder ; but to say the truth, the crazy old stargazer, a character not defunct in the days of Congreve, is a non-entity at present, and no one could make much of it. Penlby wants force for the point of Scandal, and the Tattle of Brown lacked self-importance in its mock secrecy. Harley’s Ben was his own, that is to say, pleasant, but not exactly the sailor; but in truth neither is the character itself—an objection often made to it. Mrs Davison was at home in Angelica, and the Miss True of Miss Kelly, in the courtship scene especially, was an excellent specimen of the Jordank caste of broad comedy. The parts of Mrs Foresight and Mrs Frail are necessarily much softened ; but the recriminatory scene was well given by Mrs Orger and Mrs Yates. The trick-produced marriage of Tattle and Frail went off rather flat. Indeed, the Marriage Act has so destroyed all verisimilitude in these cases, they always appear farfetched and unnatural. The piece was given out for repetition on Thursday next

Florival, ayoi*pg officer, full alike of levity and gallantry, having been engaged in a duel with the nephew of the Count, V which the latter had been wounded, flying from tb*. purihit of the avengers, takes refuge in the farmhouse of Sterv.-iold, where he finds his friend Oaendor/, in the disguise of a peasant, and is persuaded as the best mode of coBCtXiment, to adopt the same metamorphose. In this disa^ii« he meet« with Rosette, a new married country lass, not very affectionately satisfied with her whimsical bridegroom, Martin Fry, whom shi ha* left at home shamming sick, while she and her grandmother, D'edtne Dunne?, are repairing to the Castle to claim the wedding present, which by a letter she bears to her hand, the Count had promised her. Florivnl and Owendorf, both play off a little of ttaeit military and town-bred gallantly on the moody bride; who, however, in her rustic style, gives them as good as they bring, tells bsr story, or rather sings It, shows them the Count’s letter, which forms the jet of her business, and for their gallantry, turns them over to her old deaf grandmother. From the letter, however, they fortunately discover that It is necessary for her to have her husband with her, or she will not get the money; but as he is not forthcoming, and the Count has never seen him, the expedient Is hit upon of FlorivaTs personating the happy man, agd Oioendorf’s accompanying them as his cousin. This arrangement Is luckily just made In time; for just as they are departing, the soldiers arrive in parsuit of the fugitives; who, however, producing the letter which seems to confirm his pretension of being the rustic husband of Rosette, they are permitted to pass. But the soldiers having had positive information that Florival had taken refuge with the farmer, insist upon searching the house. Stemhold aware that the regimentals will be found, hits upon the expedient of pawing off Martin Fry, whom he sees approaching in quest of his bride, as the disguised object of their search. Martin is accordingly conducted by a guard of honour he snppoaesjbot in reality as the supposed duellist, to the castle of the Count. In the meantime Florival, while acting the part of Rosette's husband, is encountered rather perplexingiy by the Count’s niece, Mrs. Dorriville, the lady of his heart, on whose account he has been engaged in the duel The lady; however, though somewhat chagrined and mystified by the scene before her, does not betray him ; but a storm coming on, and the hospitable Count insisting that Rosette and her supposed husband shall stay all night, and giving orders’to the servant to prepare a bed for them, a seen* of laughable perplexity ensues *, from which, however, Mrs. Dorrtvilh (nothing loath) extricates them, by undertaking the arrangements. While they retire for this purpose, and that of hospitable refreshment, the real Martin Fry is brought in to the enraged Count, as the supposed disguised antagonist of his nephew; and another scene of laughable equivoque takes place between the Count, who supposes he has the object of his vengeance In his powf r, and Martin, who ^apposes he has been conducted thither to receive his wife’s wedding present. A discovery of the whole deception of course takes
filace; Florival is detained as a prisoner, and Martin and Rosette are odged tor the night in the Castle. The former, understanding that Mrs. Dorrioille and Rosette have planned the escape, determines, in revenge for the trick that has been put upon him, to frustrate the design, and being on the watch, gives the alarm as Florival is descending the ladder that had been provided for him, who, linding escape impracticable, slips from the middlo of the ladder into Rosette's chamber-window, for concealment. The Count, with his soldiers and servants, rushing in, in consequence of the alarm, seise, instead of the expected fugitive, upon the supposed mortally-wounded nopkew, who jqst xeturned with his arm in a sliag,is very much surprised to findthe garden gates open; and had himself for awhile to discover the nature of the intrigue which he perceived must be golngon. We need scarcly add that the duel having arisen out of the thoughtless quarrel of- two
Sally dissipated friends, all differences are readily adjusted—that 'artim and his wife are reconciled, the wedding present confirmed, ami Florival receives the willing hand of his good-natured widow. Wbdm and equivoke keep up the laugh from beginning to end. The music U light and pretty—fitted to the piece, Mies Graddoc’s “ Tr.'fles light as Air,” Is really a very bsautlful trifle; and was very highly applauded. The actors, without exception, did full justice to tbei’r respective parts. We have seen Mias Kelly do more, because she hadrnore to do : but what there was to dp was done as nobody else can do it. And to crown all,the Wedding Present has the very,very rare merit of not being a wit too l»ng. In no one scene did we feel the wish of sending it, with Polonlus’s beard, to the barber’s. Taking the minutes of bearty and unanimous applauae into the bargain, the au. dience were enabled to be out of the house while the watchman was calling past eleven o’clock—much better pleasen^we verily believe, than upon those occasions that detain them an hoifr later.

DRURY LANE.
Vanbrugh’* Confederacy was performed here last night, and wan received with much merriment and a good deal of applause. Mr*. Davison, In the dashing, Intriguing chambermaid, Flippant*, was traly admirable. We never remember to have seen her to equal advantage. SHe was never for a single instart out of her character > nor do we remember a «ingle point or situation of which she did not make the most Mrs. Yatea v as equally happy in the systematic dit-Bipatednees and aggravating tranquility of Clarissa. Her only defect was that of physical deficiency of voice, which, though pleading to the extent of its audibility, is too snail and feeble for the urea of this huge theatre. Mlsg I. Paton was gay and beautiful In Arcminta, and did for it what the haracter required -t while the inimitable Miss Keily was, as usual, equajy true to nature lu the whrewdnesa, the naivete, the girlish frosrardness and forwardness of Corinna—in dialogue, in deportment, and in byplay j aud, if with the character one c&uoot he interested, with the actress we were throughoutdeligbted. Mrs. Hariowe also did the Old lacewoman, Mrs. Amlet, upon the whole, very well, only that she carried the nobbling halt in her gait to obvious caricature. Dow. ton's Old Monegirnp wag a rich performance—sometime*, perhaps, a little too rich. Np actor personifies the fatuity ef amorous dosage so admirably as Dowton. He is, however, a little too fond of this excellence, and consequently display* ft som ’times a Ifttfe bur. of place. On« would have thought through the greater part of his first scene with Flippant*, that it was the chambermaid hervelf who was the object, not the confidant, of his winter fires Of Harley in Brass it is hardly necessary to speak. Every onv acquainted with the character will be aware that here be would be cuite at home. He was and contributed in no email degree to the laughter of the evening.	y
* *. I i
DRUtlY-LASTE THE A THE.
Vanbrugh's comedy of Tlit Confederacy was last night revised. Amongst the male characters, Mr. Dowton’s Moneyirap stood pre-eminent. He depicted with great humour the struggle between the love of woman and the love of money,by which the old usurer is tormented. His by-play was admirable. The scene between him and FHppanta, where the latteT wheedles the amorous scrivener into the “ restitution," as she terms it, of a considerable sum, was most adroitly managed. It was a very fine display of talent on both sides. Mrs. Davison appeared, for the first time, as Flippania. She never played a character better. No subtle, intriguing chambermaid ever had a more adequate representative. It was a truly cdmic performance. Mr. Williams played the part of Gripe. This gentleman understands the business of the stage, and speaks very distinctly : such are his qualifications. Of comic humour, unfortunately for the audience, and still more unfortunately for himself, he oossesses not a grain. Brass was performed by Mr. Harley with a great deal of briskness and spirit; but his best scene—that in which he threatens to betray his pretended master, unless certain concessions are made to him—was rendered less piquant than it would have been, by tha leaden acting of Mr. Penley, who rendered Dirk one of the dullest fellows that ever trod a stage. Miss Kelly for the first time played Corinrw, and in portraying the amorous feelings and girlish cunning of the hoyden, came, as we think, very near the perfection of her art. Mrs. Ifates was an agreeable Clarissa, but while she imitates the modish lady, she need not be ashamed of articulating justly. We frequently lose half the concluding words of a sentence, they are given by this lady with so much delicacy. On those occasions she reminds us of the female described in The School for Scandal, who, wanting a number of her teeth, to conceal the defect kept her mouth when speaking nearly closed, like the aperture of a poor’s box. Misj I. Paton supported the character of Jt~aminta very creditably. Mrs. Harlowe made a most effective Mrs. Amlet. Would she had had a better son.

_ .	Drurt La.n ,
On Monday evening, the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet wav produced at this theatre, in order to introduce a yoting lady of the name of Lawrence in the character of Juliet. Miss Lawrence possesses a good figure, with pleasing if not striking features, and earned herself through the arduous attempt of the evening, much as it is reasonable to expect from the possessor of fair but not commanding talents, undrilled by stage practice, and apparently acting upon general notions of the chosen part, rather than from any peculiar or distinctive readings of her own. The great physical defect of this young lady, in reference to the line to which she aspires, is want of strength of voice and intensity of tone. When this is the case, loudness must necessarily be substituted for emphasis, and the finer marking of deep feeling cannot be vocally conveyed. This want of power was peculiarly visible in the fine soliloquy uttered previously to the swallowing of the sleeping-draught; in which the frightful conceptions of the busy imagination, in regard to tíre tomb, require a deep and almost suppressed utterance to the very verge of the climax. This peculiar quality of voice we deem almost essential to fine female tragic power under any circumstances, but with the existing size of our theatres, it seems to us to be indispensable. The next most conspicuous failing of Miss Lawrence appears in the article of action, which was much too redundant, especially in a certain unceasing waving of the arms, and a quick turn of the head in the manner of a person suddenly spoken to, or partly surprised. This, however, is a removable failing, which a campaign ia the country for a single season might do much to remove. The common fault of young performers in regard to action, is the want of a visible connection between the movements and the mind; and a tendency on the part of the former to precede, rather than to follow the latter. On the whole, however, the performance of Miss Lawrence (whop) we understand to be nearly related to Mr Spring, the box book-keeper), exhibitedvery respectable capability, if nothing positively commanding. The balcony scene was her best, and possibly promised more than afterwards followed. The Romeo of Wallace was a sound performance, and secured that spontaneous attention and applause which is the highest compliment an actor can receive. A lack of intensity for Shakesperian character may doubtless be occasionally observable in this performer, but he never obviously assails the judgment, and of late has very strikingly advanced in his general powers. Brown was the Mercutio, and no • in with a voice resembling that of Brows, can possibly convey a
.ion of that gallant spirit.” The rest was passable. There was very good house, and the piece is to be repeated to-morrow.—Q.

Drury Lane.
On Wednesday evening, we repaired to this house to witness the revival of Vanburch’s Confederacy, a comedy which is possibly more witty and attractive than it ought to be. It was well played throughout, and in some parts, even admirably. The Flippant a of Mrs. Davison, for instance, is the very perfection of an artful apd intriguing waiting woman. Such is the construction of this comedy, that the whole Dramatis Persona, from first to last, are, as the vulgars say, “ no belter than they ought to beand the prominency of the dramatic importance of the servants excites little oft'ence at the comparative insignificance of some of the masters and mistresses. The manner in which Mrs Davison" extracted money from one of the miserly gallants, was rich and finished in the extreme ; and Harley, in the correspondent charactei*W the valet Brass, was almost equally happy; we have seen the part indeed performed differently, but certainly never more divertingly. The spirited, half-educated hoyden, Corrinna, fell to the lot of I^iss Kelly, who, as usual, gave it a reading entirely her own, and delighted the audience with a great
" '	' freaks, which give such
The Money trap of verging, tioweW, * mto caricature^ and ha unctiouh in its amorous dotage, but irresistibly „	>pe of Williams was ,r1ao very fair, and we
huspect that this performer would be gtjMrtpr if he exerted himself less; the most obvious defect iu his acting being an appearance of effort and anxiety to over-finish. The two wives were represented by Mrs Yates and Miss I. Paton, and that very pleasantly. TW former, who takes the most conspicuous of these fine ladies, conveyed the heartless nonchalance of the character with considerable skill. A pestilence on large sited theatres, which frequently render the most musical and natural feminine articulation inaudible! With something more of power to encounter this enormous difficulty, Mrs Yeates would rapidly ripen into a very inspiring actress. Her maniere d’etre as Lady Morgan would say, is peculiarly easy and elegant, and her brief laugh delightful. We have only further to remark, thatPENLEY’s Dick Amletlacked bronze—he did not look half enough a rogue,—and that the Mrs Amlet of Mrs Harlowe was only somewhat too lame. The Boxes on this occasion were most respectably filled; and if .we may judge from more genuine indications than mere vociferation, this comedy, as at present cast, may be repeated from time to time during the season, with profit to the management. The Wedding Present followed; the music of which, of Horne's selection, is very pleasing. The story is but middling, but, aided by the ruuveti of Miss Kelly, as a young country bride, and by the whimsicality of Harley, as her petulant and jealous husband, it was any thing but dull, and passed off very pleasantly.

O}« 'Wednesday evening, an adaptation of Mrs Tjicubald's Midnight Hour vras got up at this house with the introduction of music from various «o in posers, arranged and selected by Mr T. Cooke. It was spirited end tolerably appropriate, especially in the songs given to Mr Ho*t« and. Mis? Queir?» who performed the Marquis. arfo. Julia* That the ¿tdfier rlrí oftte mtrodtlcUoa was too feiuifer, ty us to be the principal defect, looking to the article novelty. The comic parts of Don. Guzman and Flora, in the hands of Dowton and Miss Kelly, were rendered extremely rich. The humour of the latter, when she discovers the Marquis in thè box and contrives to get Nicholas into the same awkward situation, levied largely on the mirth of the audience ; as did also the garden scene, wheu she is obliged by Don Guzman to sing the concerted signal to attraclthe Marquis. On the latter occasion, her burst of exultation when she finds that her mistress has, after all, escaped, was a truly constitutional explosion of the heartfelt mirth of an Abigail who exults in the trickery as much fron) feeling as interest. Harley has scarcely scope for his humour in Nicholas; but, as usual, was always whimsical and diverting. J. Russell was the opposing valet Sebastian, and enacted the seldom-varying varlet of that description in Spanish with tolerable breadth of humour. Upon the whole, the piece went off lightly and favourably. A few voices were heard in opposition at the close, but they were drowned by a great majority, and the piece was given out for repetition on the next evening. It will probably take its turn through the season, which we take for granted is all that has been expected from it.

THEATRICAL EXAMINER.
DrcrtLake.
Ok Thursday evening, the School for Scandal was performed at this theatre, with some novelty in the caste, the principal feature in which was the assignment of the part of Lady Teazle to Miss Kelly. From the time of Cicero downwards, and doubtless much earlier, the indisposition of mankind to admit excellence in opposing departments of acquirement has been noted, and it is nowhere more true than in reference to the stage. Setting aside the obstacles connected with envy,jf.lo ,?y, rivalry, and ether professional matters, and looking to the spontaneous feelings of play-goers alone, is this indisposition unaccountable ? We think not, and that it arises from an involuntary operation of the laws of ideal association. Whenever an actor or actress assumes a character of a different class from that in which they have been chiefly celebrated, the spectator sees more than is present; for he is haunted with the ghosts of old impressions, which will by no means always depart at the werd of command. We have in our time seen a great deal of judicious novel attempt fall a victim to these involuntary prepossessions, as well as to the kindred tendency of so associating a character with some particular person’s performance of it, as to be unable to conceive it independently of the intruding idea of its primitive or established representative. With the latter of these difficulties Miss Kelly had scarcely to contend; for, with much respectability and talent, we know of no overwhelming excellence in any other representation of Lady Teazle. In respect to the former more general obstacle, it is unavoidable; and without the least reason, looking to matter of fact, a recollection of Betty Finnikin may intrude even into Sir Peter Teazle’s drawing-room. By a stout exertion of free will—(we are very orthodox)—let us dismiss all these intrusive notions, and endeavour to attend to the Lady Teazle of Miss Kelly, as in justice it ought to be considered. Thus regarded, it was certainly a finely-marked and discriminative performance, checked, we think, by somewhat of apprehension that a higher degree of vivacity would Encounter some conventional notions in regard to the elegant fine lady. A certain triumphant air of beauty and fashion will often carry very middling talents through this character with competent applause; but we see no reason that such performances should create a model, when the predominant excellence is of another description. In a word, we thought there was a little too much repression in the hightide of drawing-room spirit, and a timidity on the part of Miss Kelly in the conveyance of her own inimitable archness, which could arise only from a fear of exciting and encountering the intrusive associations to which we have already alluded. We think, however, that she may venture a little further without danger, and certain we are that she may do so in conformity with the authors Lady Teazle, who, as it was well observed when Mrs Jordan took the character, was not intended for the finished but for the initiative fine lady; the heart was in the road to injury, but was not absolutely injured; primitive simplicity (see account of her education) had given way, but was not extinct. That celebrated actress, therefore, freely indulged the naivete which was her great characteristic, end we are satisfied that Miss Kelly may do the tame. We mention this the more freely, because it is altogether an affair of discretion; the power being out of the question. To descend to particulars, the scenes with Sir Peter were all.of them admirable, and the deportment after the falling of the screen was very finely marked, beth in its reproof of Joseph Surface and self-reprehen-rive address to Sir Peter—in the latter more particularly. In the previous coavenatioB with Jcngri too, the struggle between interposing good sense and archness, innate modesty, and a disposition to listen to the seducer, was conveyed with fine discrimination. In a word, with less fear of hypercriticism and mere routine notions-of the character before her eyes, we think that the Lady Teazle of Miss Kelly will become a first-rate performance. Mrs Davison on this occasion took the part of Mrs Candour, and represented that veteran scandal-monger with most veteran-like ability. There is possibly no actress existing more at home upon the stage than this excellent comedian, whose performance exhibits an understanding of incidental effect we scarcely ever saw surpassed. As to the rest of the caste, the Sir Peter Teazle of Dowton is well known ; he strides with no sort of scruple over the partition which divides genteel from low comedy—but then he so amuses us 1 Were bis Sir Peter more of the gentleman, as it clearly ought to be, we should not laugh half so much; added to which, although he can make excellent faces, he cannot for the life of him look querulous. Mr Williams performed Sir Oliver Surface with considerable discrimination; his principal defect was a deficiency in smoothness and jollity; in short, a precisely reverse case to that of Dowton. Wallace was a very fair Charles Surface; but Joseph Surface requires a much more plausible representative than Mr Archer, who exhibited more vinegar than oil. There is possibly not a more difficult character to hit in the whole drama than this finished hypocrite, who is to be at once the most moral and the most seducing of scoundrels. In common bands, the pedant usually predominates; it ought to be the exact reverse,for his pedantry is assumed, his facility natural. The house was tolerably well attended, and as the play proceeded, approbation evidently gained ground.

DRURY LANE.—Brutus, Amoroso, and Perouse, were the entertainments announced for performance at this theatre last evening, and until the late hour of six o’clock, we were uninformed of any alteration having taken place. We copy the following from the bill which was posted at the doors on our entrance : “ Drury Lane Theatre, (half-past five o’clock) in consequence of the very severe indisposition of Mrs. Bunn, the tragedy of Brutus cannot _ be performed this evening; and Mr. Noble, from indisposition, is ' prevented appearing this evening in Perouse.” Pizarro, as the substitute for Brutus, afforded Mr. Wallack the opportunity of appearing as the Peruvian Leader, and in one or two scenes he acquitted himself with tolerable good success. Mrs. W. West, as Elvira, is, in our humble opinion, out of her proper sphere : and Mr. Archer’s Alonzo, is decidedly a very lame piece of business.
Mr. O. Smith was the Perouse of the evening, and played the part ■ well: Miss Smithson, as Madame Perouse, acts with considerable ability.	ClU (a}	(c.)	■

THEATRICAL EXAMINER.
Dbuky La»*.
: Tat annual Pantomimes of the season are now become a very momen-tou.. affair in theatrical economy, it being quite evident that the most thinking people in the world look for their production w ith more than usual a; xiety ai.3 curiosity. We apeak not exclusively of the occu-.pants of tin. gallery, or of.,the mere holiday folks; it is quite as certain that the piquant agrtmem of the Harlequinade are relished by a preponderant portion of mature intellect, to which Melpomene is a
- core and Thalt:. ziu&ukCer. To accommodate this growing disposi-
v tion, in the preempt .instance the two hquses have put forth their strength with uncommon, ardency; and the result, at Drury-lane, has been a piece denominated the Jack of all Trades. The Knave of Clubs, for what particular reason we know not, has been selected for the representative of that versatile and comprehensive projector, whose disposition m the present instance is made slightly allusive to the recent rage of everybody to be concerned in everything. In other respects, we cannot venture to assert, that we perfectly understood the opening story,—which obtuseness on our part was of the least possible consequence to ourselves, and will probably be of little more to our readers. Suffice it to observe, that the widowed Queen of Clubs is courted by the gallant King of Hearts; hut as is often the case with widows, she gives the preference to a little gallantry from the Knave of her own suit. Of course much delicate embarrassment arises from these cross-purposes, which are terminated, as usual, by the transformation of lovers, gallants, and confidants, into Harlequin, Columbine, Clown, and Pantaloon; and this being effected, the “ rapture of the strife” (certaminis gaudia) cp^r.,-. nces. Tor the rest, we must be excused, except as to generals. Toe tricks and transforma. tions were good; sevirahof diem novel,all well executed. A few practical puns were > verg-fair hits: one of which, the jumping of the Anatomic Vivanle through an aperture in the box front of Drury-lane Theatre, masked as th£place of admission for Bones, produced much laughter Of agility in the way of leaping and jumping, there was also a quantum sufficit, in which, as usual, the Pantaloon of Blanchard was strikingly conspicuqus. Howell was the Harlequin, Miss Barnett the Columbine, end Solthby the Clown; all of them, we need not say, are leading artistes,—such, we believe, being the new denomination. A very happy introduction of a scene of gymnastics, in which there is some terrifically fine rope dancing by a gentleman who assumes the cognomen of II Diavolo Antonio, from Turin, tog ther with some fair balancing and ball-throwing by male and female jugglers, also added much to the variety and eclat of the entertainment. The scenery, chiefly by Stanfield and Roberts, merits high commendation. A panoramic series, commencing with the launch of a ship at Dover, and proceeding with her history through a smart gale of wind, which increases into a storm, until she is finally towed, dismasted and dismantled, into port,—was in no small degree
•	impressive and well-conceived. On the whole, great pains have been taken in the Jack of all Trades, and they have not been thrown away. Indeed we hear that it already exhibits the pleasing symptoms of a great probable run; and, for all sorts of reasons, we are heartily glad of it.
Liston’s appearance at this house has answered every expectation,
•	—such is the attraction of originality. We suspect, however, that this
exclusive sort of taste is no small proof of the decline of the drama iR_amore intellectual and general sense. Whether or no, we will not spbii pathetics on the subject, at the termination of an account of a ft^ulbiqinie.	'	'	.

DRURY-LANE.
Tumult Kxtraordxnnrv-^-Indisposition of-Via Stephens and Mr. Sinthnr.—On Friday the opera of ‘ Guv Mannerinv" was announced for representation, the characters of ‘ Lucy’ and ‘ Henry Bertram’ by Miss Stephens and Mr. Sinclair; but when ‘ Luc" Bertraai’ entered, it was instantly seen that Miss Grad-don fand not Miss Stephens was the representative of that heroine. Disapprobation was expressed, and Miss Graddonwas obliged to leave the stage. After a pause, Mr Penlev came forward ; bat his intelligence that notonlyMissStephens,"butMr. Smrlair wus lost to them for the evening, was received with manifestations of disappointment and anger. Cries of ‘ Shame!’
‘Off off!’ interrupted his address. Mr. Liston next entered as an apologist. He addressed the house generally, but his efforts were unsuccessful; the former cries were repeated with additional expressions of reproach, and the tumult rose to a height rarely witnessed in a plav-house since the memorable O.P. row in 1809. The manager "having been repeatedly called for, Mr. ■ EUistsn, jun., presented himself, and said those who were dis satisfied, if they chose to leave the house, should hare their money. This called forth some applause, and he afterwards succeeded in making it understood thar he held In his hand the certificate of Mr. Sinclair’s indisposition. Miss Stephens, he added, was unable to perform front the situation in which her father lay—at the point of death.
After this appeal hostility subsided, till the conclusion of the first act. A long pause succeeded. The audience became again impatient, when Air. EUiston, jun. again claimed their attention as an apologist. Mr. Horn had been sent for but had not yet arrived, and under these circumstances Mr. Yardlev, with their permission, would act the character of ‘ Henry.' No opposition was made, and he shortly afterwards commenced his arduous taak, which considering the disadvantages under which he labored, he very creditably performed.
DRURY LANE.—The opera of Guy Mannering was last evening performed at this theatre. Mr. Sinclair and Miss Stephens were to have appeared as Henry and Lucy Bertram; but in consequence of sadden and severe indisposition, both of these distinguished vocalists were absent, and Mr. Horn and Miss Graddon were announced to fill their characters; here again disappointment took place, for Mr. Horn could not perform; and the part of Henry Bertram was sustained by Mr. Yarnold—“ what a blessing to have such a friend in the house.” Although hills were posted at the doors, announcing the misfortune, the audience were very dissatisfied, and would not allow the opera to proceed. Mr. Liston apologised—read the affidavits from the “ Medical Advisers •”— Miss Graddon went on; and the gods were proof against even her tears. Nothing would suffice but the manager. In consequence of the “ continued indisposition” of Mr. Wallack, he could not appear; and as a last effort, Mr. William Elliston, the younger, made his appearance before the angry moltitude— a first appearance and unannounced 1 Under such disadvantages, Mr. Elliston, jun. acquitted himself to the entire satisfaction of the public, and effectually restored harmony, by stating, that “ those who were dissatisfied, might receive back their money.’’—(A few orderly people were here observed to retire.) It would be unfair to notice any faults that occurred, in consequence of this Chapter of Occidents ; but we cannot avoid noticing the very delightful manner in which Miss Graddon sang the songs and acted the part of Lacy Bertram—it reflects great credit on this young lady, exerting, as she did, her utmost abilities in such a dilemma. The pantomime concluded the entertainments. The house was very full.

Drurt Lake.
On Wednesday evening the United States did us the favour to supply us with an actor in exchange for the one which our “moral” indignation has transported to their shorcsj of the name of Pelby. This gentleman, with no small ambition, selected the part of H'imUt for his first appearance; and without anything like general success, evinced very respectable talents and considerable knowledge of stage business. The physical requisites for a star are however somewhat scantily possessed by Mr Pelby. He scarcely reaches the middle size in stature, although well formed. His features are somewhat sharp, yet expressive; but his voice is weak, and his articulation defective. Great genius alone can surmount this latter difficulty, which frequently obliges a performer in theatres of the winter size, to adapt the spirit of a passage to his own capability, rather than to the sense of the author. Whether any of the new readings of Mr Pelby are attributable to this defect, we know not; but some of them appeared very like it. His study of Kean is very evident; bat we do not blame this sort ot attention, when not carried to the slavish excess of mere imitation, which was certainly not the case in the present instance. On the contrary, we thiuk that the principal fault of Mr Pelby is too great affectation of the colloquial as opposed to forcible or declamatory recitation. He told the ghost he would follow him, as if he were yielding the pas into a drawing-room; and on slaying Potoaius. asks “ Is it the king?” as if he were demanding who knocked at the door. This is burlesquing ease; but new readings are always supplying quicksands of this description. Upon the whole, however, he decidedly proved his knowledge of his author; and many parts of his performance elicited very spontaneous applause :—call it a good reading, supported by an intimate acquaintance with the boards; for nothing could be more free and unembarrassed than his action, and his exits and his entrances evinced considerable experience. In the last act, his fencing with Laertes drew down peals of approbation, and was really an admirable exhibition of the kind. Nothing could exceed the courtesy of the audience on this occasion, even setting aside the obvious encouragement of friends. Before the pantomime was allowed to commence, some injudicious persons clamoured for his appearance; and he in consequence came forward, and briefly thanked them for their kind reception of “ a stranger.” The tacticians were wrong; the repetition of the play should have been demanded, not the appearance of the actor. Dowton was the Polonius of the evening, and Miss Graddon the Ophelia, which she sang sweetly, and acted very poorly. We cannot conclude without affording our meed of praise to the Queen of Mrs West, who performed the closet scene very finely. By the way, we have heard a rumour in regard to the appearance of this American Roscius, which much surprises us. It is a new thing in'theatrical economy, we believe, to grant a debut on a formal bond of indemnification against loss by a new aspirant’s performance. Is this liberal ? We think not.

The story, we have no doubt, *|rill be remembered by our readers, when we inform them it is, with the exception of a few alterations and additions, the same as that dramatised under the name of Oscar and JMalvina ; or, the Hall of Fingal. The characters of Conlath and Morna have been introduced, which, if we mistake not, ought to be Coijlath and Cuthona, the story of whom runs thus:—	.
“ Conlath, the youngest of Morna’s sons, is in love With Cut.hona, the daughter of Rumar. When Toscar, the son of Kinfsra, accompanied by his friend Fercnth, arrive at Mora, where Conlath dwelt ; they were received ■with hospitality, and feasted for three days, as was the custom of the country, by Coniath. On the fourth daj they set sail, and coasting the Island of Waves, probably one of the Hebrides,Toscar meets Cuthona hunting ; falls in love with her, and carries her away by force in his ship. In the mean time, Conlath hearing of the rape, sailed after him, and found him on the point of sailing for the coast of Ireland. They fought ; and they and their followers fell by mutual wonnds. Cuthona did not long survive : she was Kupposed to have died the third day after of grief."
The story is somewhat altered in the opera, for it commences with the arrival of Conlath, at Toscar’s castle, to revenge his injuries. We cannot speak in terms of praisp of any thing the author has done for the piece ; for with the exception of one or two passages, the language throughout is lamentably meagre, and of the most inferior description ; neither does the plot afford any very fine or striking dramatic situations. The music is entirely composed of well known Irish and Scotch airs, which were well executed ; with the exception of the music, the entire merit of the piece is due to the scene painters, and stage manager. The scenery, which is very beautiful, reflects the highest credit on the several artists, in particular, Mr. Stanfield. The march of the Irish chieftains was extremely well arranged, and owing to good stage management, well represented. The piece is, however, much too long and tiresome ; many of the scenes lagged, and from the total want of interest in the part assigned to Mr. J. Russell, we hope, on the next representiou it will be omitted. Mr. Sinclair—how shall we name it?—was Oscar! and a mighty fine specimen he gave us of the valiant chief.—O Mr. Sinclair! will no entreaties persuade you to throw a little life and animation into the parts assigned you ? or, are you ever to be a mere automaton vocalist 1 Cathullin was performed by Mr. Horn with much spirit. The part of Moma was sustained by Miss Kelly, but so littl3 has the author done for her, tliat she almost fails to impart any interest. Miss Stephens, as Malvina, warb’ed several airs delightfully. Mr. Wallack did more for the part of Conlath, than the character deserved ; and Mt. Archer, as MoTven, played what he had to do well. We hope the knife will be appplied to some of the nonsense attached to Mr. Harley’s Pedlar. The opera was announced for repetition on Tuesday next, amidst considerable applause. The house was very full.
THEATRES.
Drurv Lane.—Last night a new ballad Opéra, (the subject from Ossian) entitled Malvina, was produced at this Theatre. The overture and musjc, the chief part of which wH I is i (ranged from Scotch ami Irish Melodic*, is the production of Mr. T. Cooke. The piece is got up in a style which re fleets the highest credit ou Mr. Elliston. The following is an outline of the Plot :—Toscar (Mr. Pope) is about to marry his daughter * Malving’ (Miss Stepheus) to Oscar, the son of Fingal (Mr. Sinclair.) On the day appointed for the celebration of the nuptials‘MorveiP and ‘Toulath,* two Irish Chieftains (Mr. Archer and Mr. Wallack) with a band of troops arrive at the castle of Toscar, where they meet with t friendly reception, and are invited to a banquet by their host. While partaking cf his hospitality ‘ Cathullln,’ Lord of Ulster, (Mr. Horn) enters in the disguise of a wandering minstrel, when, in consequence of some remarks made respecting him by Oscar, u quarrel ensues between the two parties, when Cathullin throws off his disguise, and the parties proceed to draw swords, but are at length reconciled through the intervention of * Malvina,* and the first Act closes with a beautiful trio by Miss Stephens, Mr. Sinclair, ami Mr. Horn, ‘ Take thou this cup with ruby wine.o’er-flowing,* and which was sung by them in the most exquisite manner, and was highly applauded In the opening of the second Act, * Coulath* informs 4 Morven* that the son of * Toscar* had seduced and carried off his wife, but had since perished in a storm, in which *he believes she also perished ; and at that moment 4 Calhullin' enters, and avows his intention of carrying off 4 Malvina* by force, and the others agree to assist him, and which they ultimately succeed in doing, and she is placed in a cave ; but her placé of confinement is discovered by 4 Morna (Miss Kelly), the wife of 4 Coulath,* and who, it appeared, was wrecked off the coast when her seducer perished ; but she was saved, and had since lived in the cave, but was supposed to be insane. 4 Malvina* is left in charge of 4 Coulath,* who consents to assist in favoring her escape, but they are pursued by 4 Cathullin,’ when * Oscar’ and his party come to their assistance, and after some skirmishing between then*, 4 Malvina’ is rescued, and the happy pair are united.—
Harley and Miss Povey had a trifling part assigned them, in ighich they acquitted themselves, very’ respectably. Miss Stephens hail several delightfhl airs assigned to her, which she sang with her accustomed sweetness, and was twice honored with an encore. Mr. Sinclair and Mr. Horn were both in fine voice, particularly the former, who sang in hb very best style«*-The scenery* which is painted by Mariuari and Roberts is extremely beautiful, particularly thedost scene, which represents a cataract, and in which real water is introduced. The piece was received throughout with considerable applause, and at the falling of the curtain the announcement of it for repetition, by Mr. Wallack, was received with loud cheers. The house was excessively crowded in every part.	*

■
\
Drdry Lane.
On Thursday week we attended the third representation of a new piece at this theatre, entitled Malvina, and entitled moreover “ a national ballad opera.” The story is from Ossian, as our readers may conjecture; and there we will leave it at their option to turn to or not, as they please. Nothing short of “ wain-ropes ” would bring us to sit out a second torment of the piece itselt. It now seems quite apparent, that our classical theatres may at any time calculate upon something like success, if they will but be at the trouble and expense of having a few showy scenes, glittering dresses,
“ Gun, drum, trumpet, blunderbuss, and thunder,—
“ The minstrel boy to the war is gone ”—" The dashing white sergeant;—and, as a corollary, a procession of soldiers clanking upon tin shields. We absolutely pitied Miss Stephens, who was doomed to drawl through songs she must have loathed, and a part which it would have been a credit to her either to have rejected or forgotten. There was Mr Sinclair as Oscar; Mr PorE as Toscar (his father); Mr Powell, Fisigal; Mr Horne, Cuthullin; Mr Wallace, Conlath; and Miss Kelly as Moma. Mr Noble danced after the most approved fashion of Paris; and Mr IIaklEy, as a Scotch pedlar, dispensed garters, ribbons, tapes, and buttons! The performers however exerted themselves as if each were proprietor of the theatre and composer of the piece; and the house (as might be expected) was well sttended.	•	* * *

Being the Last Night of the Company's performing till the Easter Holidays.
THEATRICAL EXAMINER.
Drury Lavs.
Or Thursday evening a new operatical play was produced at this house, entitled Benyowsky, the authorship or alteration of which from the well-known play ot Kotseble, is given to Mr Kenny. The story of the hero of this play is so well known, we esnnot resolve to afflict oor readers with any formal detail of the plot.
It will therefore suffice to observe, that, as in the original Memoirs, the Polish Count Benyowsky being taken prisoner by the Russians, is exiled to Kamschalkn, where he heads a conspiracy of persons similarly situated, to master their guard, and escape from their dreary thraldom. Benymvsky, from his accomplishments, being selected by the Governor to instruct Ins daughters, the heart of Alhancsia (the elder of them) falls a victim to Yus address. So far in conformity to the fact; but the dramatic development of the plot and amour cf course varies very widely. The result, however, is the same, as regards the conflict between love and duty, and the success of the conrpiracy; but Mr Kenny has turned the interest of bis Beti-yotathy chiefly upon the anger and jealousy of a rival, also an exile, who, tn the madness of his passion for AihmMtia, is induced to betray his associates. This character is drawn with some force, and keeps up a lasting interest, by his rapid repentance, display of latent magnanimity, and preservation of his successful rival, after all. Thecon-clusion is very lame; for in order to unite the hero and heroine iq a proper manner, with angry papa’s consent, his worship the Governor—a very obtuse person, by the way—is persuaded into a sort of rebellion against his imperial mistress Catherine, and we know not but 4bat upon dropping the curtain, an expedition against St Peters-buvgh will take place. This is altogether and gratuitously absurd. There is also another defect: Benyotesky, the hero of the piece, does absolutely nothing, not even make love, which is however manufactured very prettily, and in great profusion, by Attonasla (Miss Foote). The jealous Slephanoff", in fact, takes the entire lead in dramatic importance; and thus the real interest of the story,—the conflicting situations of Benyotesky and Athanasia,—are rendered subservient to an incident with which they have no direct connexion. The greater part of the music, which was all selected, fell very power , lessly; and unfortunately Miss Foote attempted more in this way than she can cleverly perform. The Maria DurUngton sort of dancing was also entirely oat of character; but the devotedness of attachment, which forms the great point of the love-sick Athamitia, was very gracefully given, and she looked nearly everything that could be wished. Bennett’s Benyomky was possibly as good as the character will •allow: being that of smooth passionless magnanimity, it had no angles, and consequently points were out of the question. Stephanoff is precisely the character for WaI.uci, being seriously meto-dra-malie. In one or two of his jealous conflicts he displayed considerable energy. The mirth of the piece rests upon Harley, whose representation of one Mr Timothy Stark, exiled to Siberia for fathering an epigram upon a statesman, borrowed from an English newspaper, displayed all hie characterisiic whimsicality. Tire puns and equivoque of this eccentric personage were not unamusing ; bis allusion to his library, containing nit the Russian poets, which he had concealed behind the window-shutter, in particular, was highly relished. Although an entire excrescence as to the story, we suspect that the aforesaid Air Stark did almost everything for the play. It is scarcely pecesssary to notice the mere walking and sinking characters of the rest of the dramatis person*; the latter fell to Hors, Bedford, Mis, Tovf.y, and Miss Clbitt. There was some sad mishaps either in fhe adaptation Or execution of some of the concerted pieces, which called down merited re roof. The s> enery is very good, and, upon tlie whole, the approbation, although not perfectly unmixed, was deeded, Passable as times go, but scarcely worthy Kenny.

. DRL’RY LANE.—Last night was performed, for the third time, the dpefific play of Benyowsley, in which the excellent acting of Miss Foote, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Harley, and Mr. Wallack, were displayed with great effect, and the piece went off with considerable applause. We think the song sang by Miss Foote, on her first entrance, would be better omitted, as it appears to be totally unsuited to her voice, ana she seemed to give it with very little satisfaction to herself, and certainly teas ttfffhe audience. The great attraction of the evening, to the holiday folks in particular, was the grand romantic Fairy Tale of Oberon ; or, the Charmed Horn, which was produced with a magnificence that does credit to the managers. It seems to be a march stolen on the other house, and evidently shows that much more time was necessary, than has been employed, to do justice to the piece. The scenerh in several instances was badly worked, and spoiled the effect; but that we mostly expect on a first representation, and doubt not, bat it will be seon remedied. There are several very beautiful .scenes, particularly the first, Fairy Land, by Stanfield ; in which, also the abilities of the mechanists, in the working of various birds, are effectively displayed; Sir Huon’s Vision, by Marinarj, ip which is shewn, ip the distance, a part of the Palace of Bagdad, and (the greatest baauty of the scene) the Princess Amanda, Miss Smithson. The change of the dresses of Sir Huon and Sherasmii, were very cleverly effected. The distant view of Bagdad, by Roberts; the Grand Hall iu the Caliph's Palace, by Marinari; the Harbour of Tunis, the Illumined Gardens of the Harem, and the magnificent Pavilion of Charlemagne, all by Stanfield, were specimens of excellence in the' sCenfe art, and were enthusiastically applauded. The acting of Mr. Bennett deserves great praise ; as, also, that of Mr. Browne and Miss Smithson, A comic part was well sustained by Mr. Fitzwilliam, and a song, which we give inthis day’s number, sung by him with good effect.
The plot of the piece rests on a quarrel between their fairy majesties, Oberon aud Titania,respecting the frailty of married females, and a solemn vow, by which they bind themselves never to meet again, till a couple be found, who under every reverse of fortune shall be true to each other; and they separate, each to seek for a virtuous pair. Sir Huon of Guyenne, who is on a pilgrimage to Bagdad, tinder an edict of the Emperor Charlemagne of Prance, where he is to convert and marry the Caliph’s daughter, kill his most honored guest, and out off a lock from tho Caliph’s heard, and return to France in a year, on pain of forfeiture of his lands and titles, for having kilted -the Emperor’s son at a tournament. He reaches the Forest of Lebanon, in his way to Bagdad, where Prince Babekon, suitor to the Caliph’s daughter, has repaired to destroy a fierce tiger, who infests the neighbourhood, but is near becoming his prey, when he is rescued, and the tiger slain, by Sir Huon. The Knight arrives at Bagdad in time to refute Prince Babekon’s boasting, and kills him in fight; the Caliph’s daughter unites herself to Sir Huon, and after encountering various vicissitudes, they reach France on the day of the tournament—Sir Huon defeats the Champion, produces the Caliph’s daughter as his bride, the turban of Prince Babekon, and the beard of' the Caliph, thereby fulfilling the edict of Charlemagne, and the piece ends with the reconciliation of Oberoo&Titania. The house was very full, and the piece generally was well received, but considerable curtailment is necessary—this done, the excellence of the scenery and acting, may render Oheron an attractive entertainment.
^^THEATRICAL EXAMINER.
Drury Like.
Os Monday night, a new, splendid, melo-dramatic romance was brought out at this theatre, entitled Oberon, heing founded on the celebrated fairytale of the same name, by Wjeland. Sotheby’s translation of that poem being so well known, we need only observe that their fairy Majesties, Oberon and Titania, having separated themselves in anger, until a pair of genuine lovers can be made happy, the former favours the gallant adventure imposed by the Emperor Charlemagne upon Sir Huon of Guienne, who had slain his kinsman in single combat. The trifle required of him is—to kill an Infidel Prince, gain the love and person of the Caliph of Bagdat’s daughter, and, by way of dower, to exact from the aforesaid Caliph a lock of his beard. All these extraordinary feats are performed by means of ' a charmed horrf bestowed by Oberon, which renders men immoveable, sets them laughing, dancing, and so on, whenever the purposes of Huon are to be answered. We need say no more as to plan; and as to execution, the scenery and decoration are tasteful and splendid in the extreme. We will not trust ourselves farther; because we frankly confess that Ibis species of entertainment is extremely distasteful to us, whle it is certainly not so to other people; for we never witnessed more spontaneous bursts of admiration on any occasion than those which reached our ears on this. Under such circumstances, what I pan Managers do? Seeing the success of these pieces, and the comparative neglect of regular Tragedy and Comedy, we are at a loss to see the end of the degradation, but wait with pious confidence the Avatar of some splendid dramatic genius in due time, to revive the drooping legitimate sisters, and to reduce their flaunting bastard relation, Melodrama, to her proper place. We suspect that revivals will scarcely effect this desirable consummation, and have therefore nothing else to trust to.
The minor theatres have opened the summer Campaign with great spirit; and all sorts of spectacles, horrors, terrors, extatics, and extravaganza meet our eyes in staring capitals, at the turn of every corner. We hear of no time yet assigned for the performance of the forthcoming opera of Weber.	Q.

THE THEATRES. ' DRURY-LANE.
had their fill, we presume, of
jxnyuuimi/, a j>vw ¡air) tale, entitled Oberon, or The Charmed Horn, was performed for .the first time. Those who are at the head of this establishment, knowing that the Covent-garden proprietors were about to produce Weber's Oberon, tfetermined to forestall them, and their laudable anxiety had produced one of the most tiresome pieces of splendid nonsense that ever was represented on this or any other stage. The plot, which was most unmercifully attenuated, which was stretched through two long acts with a persevering industry that would do credit to the most laboriousof thespiiler race,may hedescribedy marvellous as it is, in a very few words. •Sir Ifuon of Cayenne, a brave crusader, has, as thedestinies decreed, slain in single combat, Sekorfot, the son of the renowned Cltarleniuyne. The enraged father, instead of taking the life of the victor, sentences him, somewhat whimsically, to proced to the holy land on a pilgrimage. He moreover enacts, that this unfortunate wight shall bind himself, by a sacred oath, to visit Bagdad; that he shall there enter the Caliph’s palace/ murder the Caliph’s most honoured guest, marry and convert the Caliph’s daughter, and cut from the old monarch's beard a lock of silver hair. If he fail in performing these extraordinary exploits within a twelvemonth, he is to be deprived of his honours and estates. Supernatural agency is of course called in to aid Mm. It has fortunately happened, that Oberon, the fairy king, and his spouse Titania have had a quarrel on that never-to-be-Rettled point, whether matt or woman possess the greater constancy in love. The consequence is a matrimonial tiff, and a temporary separation a menm el Ihoru, while the firmness of Amanda, the »laughter of the Caliph of Bagdad, and the truth of Sir Ifuon, who has seen the lady in a dream and become enamoured of a shadow, are put to the test. Oberon befriends the young warrior, and presents him with a charmed horn, (rather atr ominous gilt to a man about to enter the nuptial state) ; whicli upon being sounded in a peculiar manner, makes thfc auditors either laugh or sleep, or fixes them like statues to the spot where they stand. Thus powerfully succoured, Sir Huon overcomes every difficulty. He kills his rival Prince Babekon, elopes with Amandat clips his father-in-law’s venerable beard, and arrive! time enough at the Court of Charlemagne to claina his.honours and estate*. The two fairies are rejoice« to discover that constancy may sometimes, however seldom, be found in both man and woman. Like Peackum and Lodcit, they own that they were both io the wrong ; and the piece ends (a consummation which we devoutly wished for a full hour before thd curtain fell) with a general dance. Ridiculous as ali this is, a man of ordinary cleverness might have formed an amusing trifle out of such materials. Bui the author, whoever he may be, has no idea either of sentiment or humour. He proves himself, in the serious pan of this drama, to be a most bombastic personage; and in that of a more lively character, an in-vcterate,but very bad punster. Describing a combat,’ the hero says, “ our swords, like two impatient levers* kissed and an old fellow, astonished at meeting hie master, exclaims, “ Lie still, thumping heart, and leave my ribs uncracked !” Surely, to use the common expression, the brain of him who could write such fustian must be cracked. The audiences, at this time of the year, are in general pretty placable ■ but the nauseous stuff which was served up to them last night* accompanied thoughtit was by some exquisite seeneryj the production of Stanfield and Roberts, soured their temper completely, and, in the course of the performance, and on the falling of the cumin, they declared their displeasure, very unequivocally. Jt is a pity that so much money has been thrown away on so miserable an affair. Much of the scenery is entitled to the highest commendation. The banks of the Tigris, and the panoramic view of the harbour of Tunis, by Stanfield, are very beautiful and effective
I pictures, elaborately drawn and brilliantly coloured, rhe distant view of Bagdad, by Roberts, is excellent. Amongst the performers, Miss Vincent, who appeared as Oberon, was by far the best; and next to her was the dog, who performed the part of a raging Tiger ; and by his cleverness, put some of his bipedal companions to the blush. Themusic, which is selectedbj| Mr. T. Cooke, has nothing very attractive in it. The author has dedicated this precious morceau to “ The Performers, the Manager, Acting Manager, and Composer ; and the unrivalled artists of Drury-lanrf Theatre." The honour was certainly worthy of the menu of Messrs. Wallack and T. Cooke; but truly the artists, Messrs. Stanfield and Roberts, have sonni reason to be dissatisfied with such a paltry compfimeut. The curtain did not ilrop until half-past 12 o’clock. If the Manager will not profit by this hint, we hopd that those wlio were predisposed to take their children to the ’I heatre will.

Drurv -lank Theatre.—Mr. Mac ready made his secosd appearance on Wednesday, in the tragedy of William Tell, before a crowded and fashionable audience. This play affords ample opportunity for a display of that peculiar power of declamation in language, and alternate repose and passion in action, which d'otiniiuishes Mr. Macready as an actor, and he araiied bim-seit of their advantages with all his former and well-remembered success. The excellence cf bis dialogue with Gesh-r, when called upon to undergo the harrowing ordeal of cleaving the apple on tlie head of his son, and the appapnt mental struggle which be seemed to endure, before he could screw up his courage to that superhuman task, were some of the happiest efforts of his language asd action, and most deservedly ap,.landed. We regret, however, to see, that Mr, Mac heady still suffers a little from his late severe illness j there seemed occasionally an effsrt in delivery, nnd a long drawn respiration, which shewed that his lungs had not yet recovered their wonted power. The afterpiece of Oberon succeeded, aad its beautiful scenery was again displayed with undiminished effect.

ij(pSk,i«0	Drury Lane, May 13. yff/f
In tlie present state of the drama, it is a novelty to hare a play of Shakspeare’s well cast and supported, and not dependant for interest and effect oa the solitary and unaided efforts of a leading performer, who is tbc only attraction, and who claims the almost undivided attention of the audience. If the public taste is ever to be turned into its old channel, and the painter and machinest become subservieut to the dramatist, it must be by a combination of talent, such as was presented, last night, in Henry tj{e Fourth. The genius of Shaks-peare, universal in its nature, should be supported by an adequate variety of talent ; his chaiacters are connected with, and act upon each other, and a failure in any one almost destroys the illusion and effect of that lo which it is opposed ; the most perfect Othello will be injured by an inadequate logo.	,
From Mr. Elliston’s reception as FaUtaff, last night, it was evident that public expectation had been strongly excited, audit certainly was not disappointed. His Falstaff is the best which we have at present on the stage, and no person who witnessed it, could fail to feel surprise, and regret that it was never before attempted by him he has completely entered into the spiiit of the part; the reckless jollity—the wit which is never at a fault—the self complacency, which nothing can disturb, and the epicurean voluptuousness of its animal enjoyment It is in bis hands perfectly easy and natural, and is free from that tendency to grossness, which is observable in the clever performance of the same character by Dowton. We were sorry to observe that Mr. Elliston’s physical powers are greatly impaired. Mr. Macready’s Hotspur is the essence and spirit of chivalry itself—an exemplification of the definition which has been given of it—“ poetry embodied in action.” The fiery and vehement temper of Hotspur waa constantly In operation ; and the scene which succeeds the commadC of the King that he should speak no more of Mortimer—the apostrophe to honor—and the conclusion, aided by his picturesque attitudes, were in his best and most effective style.
We have seldom seen Mr. Wallack, to greater advantage, in deportment and acting, than in the Prince of Wales ; Mr. Browne’s Point was very respectable : Mr. Archer performed the King in the invariable royal manner—his rebuke to Worcester, however was very good. The announcement that the play would be repeated on Monday next, was received with much applause—The Marriage of Figaro followed,
Ucft.to''! DRUKX LANE 1HEATRE.
Mr. Eliiston’s leng-promised appearance as Palstaff, in the first part of Henry If '., took place last night, and the pleasure with which this long-established favourite was greeted by the audience on first presenting himself was increased at per1 ceiving him in full possesion of his power, health, and spirits. No actor.of the present day possesses finer natural requisites the part of Fal.tafj, Ip which a Urge si ek '.'qualifications ro i.-: have bepi added, depvr-J fnyn his expttj<4cc of the stage, and of the great drama of life Its. i- It is however hazarding a safe opinion to say, that» representation of Fatslcff which shall satisfy the admirers of Shakspeare, will probably not be gif eh till the size of our theatres is reduced, and until some actor, possessing great original talent, shall, make his first essay in that character. It is no censure oil Mr. Elliston’s effort of last night to «ay, that it presented difficulties which it was impossible for him to surmount. The joviaf disposition, at l*ist, of the fat knight, and that quality of nnnd which makes him not only , witty himself, but the cause of wit in others, were excellently pourtrayed. A close rver might have perceived that the perfect good humour with which the jokes of the Prince ought to be received, did occasionally desert him, hut the rally of his spirits auickly followed in all cases. In die scene where the Prince exposes bis lying narrative of the affair on Gadshill, his pretence to appear disconcerted white collecting himself to exclaim, « By the Lord I know ve, as well as he that made ye," was admirable. It was evident from h.s manner that he had prepared his reply, and that he was sure of its effect. Mr. Ellislon certainly made Falstajf as entertaining as any of his predecessors in the character, and an attempt so unexpected, which has evidently cost the actor no small study, will in all probability attract much of the puhjlc a tention. A very spirited representation of Hotspur, with which the town is already, we believe, familiar, w as given hy Mr. Macready; and Mr.
Wallack’s Prince Henry deserved praise. Mrs.
West played Lady Percy ; and tbe antiquated costume of Hostess Quickly looked becoming on Mrs. Orger.

Mr. William G. Fins ton begs leave to state that his Father, Mr. Elliston, in the situation in which he at present stands with respect to the Theatre, has determined not to take a Benefit. Having, in the coarse of the season, and during the illness of his Father, been entrusted with a considerable share in the management, Mr. William G. Elliston takes the liberty of announcing that, at the suggestion of several of his friends, he has decided to venture upon a Benefit, on his own account. This Benefit will take place at the Theatre Royal, Drury-1 ane, on Thursday, the 22nd Instant; and, in the peculiar? circumstances in which he is placed, Mr. William G. Flliston trusts it will not be deempd presumptuous in him to express a hope, that the liberal patronage with which his Father has, on so many occasions, been honoured, and in the endeavour to deserve which his whole properly has been sacrificed, will, in seme degree, be extended to his Son and It epresentative, at a moment when it cannot fail to be of so much value to him, and to those connected with him.	.

Mr. William G. Elusion begs leave to state that bis Father, Mr. Elusion, in the situation«! which he at present stands with retpect to the Theatre, has (tettaurined not to take a Benefit. Having, in the course of the season, and during the illness of his Father, b-en entrusted with a considerable share in the management, Mr. William G. Ellistoo takes the liberty of announcing that, at the suggestion of several of his friends, he has decided to venture upon a Benefit, on his own account. This Benefit will take place at tbe Theatre Rojal, lirury-Lane, on Thursday, the 22nd Instant; and, m the peculiar circumstances in which he is placed, Mr. William G. Ellhton trusts it will not be deemed presumptuous¿n him to express a hope, that the liberal patronage with which his Father has, on so many occasions, been honoured, and in the endeavour to deserve which his whole property has Wen sacrificed, will, in some degree, be extended to his Son and Representative, at a moment when it cannot fail to be of so much value to him, and to those connected with him.
Due intimation will be given of the performances, iu which the strength of the Drury-Lane a d Covent-Garden Companies will be combined; and, in the meantime, Tickets may be had and Places taken, of Mr Spring, at the Box-Office iu the Theatre, and of Mr. W. G. Ellfs'.ou, at No. 9, Stratford-Place.
