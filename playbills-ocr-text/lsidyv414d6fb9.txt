fJUNTRD AT KNOTT AND LLOYD'S OFFIcE

A R E P O R T having been in Circulation,
that Mr. M'Cready prevented the Young Roscius
from performing, the following Letter and Address, published in Aris's Birmingham Gazette
of this Day, must convince the most prejudiced
person, that such Report is totally groundless.
BIRMINGHAM, September 3, 180 k

TO

THE

EDITOR.

SlK,

YOUR granting a Place in your Paper to the following Lines, will be
considered a particular Obligation conferred on the Father of the Young
joscius, who, in his Son's Name, embraces this Opportunity of returning his
m ost unfeigned Thanks to the Ladies and Gentlemen of Birmingham, for the
t m ly flattering Reception they have honoured him with on his FIRST Visit
to England. The Applause bestowed on his juvenile Efforts, and the Hospitality he has experienced, impresses his youthful Mind with Sensations,
which Time or Circumstances can never efface.
The Attention, Punctuality, and liberal Conduct of the Manager, call
forth his most sincere Acknowledgments. I t was with infinite Regret Mr.
Betty observed, that a Misrepresentation of Facts had placed that Gentleman'in so unpleasant a Predicament on Friday Evening; although his own
Statement was sufficiently clear, candid, and evidently satisfactory to the
Audience, yet I feci it is but Justice in me to assure the Public, that Mr.
a n d earnest
M'Cready ( s o f a r f r o m o b J e c t m £ ) rePeatedly
b
requested I would
allow the Youth to continue the Remainder of the Season and perform for
every Benefit, and that lie would be responsible for the Amount of any Encrao-ement'I would enter into; but the Dread of continued 'Exertion proving
Uirious to his Health, compelled me to decline all Solicitation.
In the most positive and unequivocal Manner I declare, that no Individual
whatever had any Promise of his Aid from me, who alone had the Power to
make such Promise,
I have the Honour to be, with great Respect,
Sir, your obliged humble Servant,
H E N R Y BETTY.
BIRMINGHAM, September 1, ISO*.

Mr H I L L , grateful for the public Favour he experienced on his Benefit
Niorit beo-s Leavfe to state to the Ladies and Gentlemen of Birmingham,
that it w a s t e the kind and unsolicited Interference of the Manager, he w^as
indebted for the very essential Advantage he derived from the Performance
of the Young Roscius. An invidious and fallacious Report being in Circulation asserting that Mr. M'Cready had endeavoured to prevent the Young
Roscius performing, induces Mr. Hill to obtrude on the Public this Acknowledgment of Mr. M'Cready s voluntary Act of Friendship, at a Moment
when, in a great Degree, it militated against his ozan Interest.
THEATRE, September 1, 1804.

Miss D A V I E S having been seized with severe Lameness, prevents
her from performing in the Farce this Evening; and Miss C H A P M A N
undertakes the Character at a very short Notice, m the Hope that she shall
experience the Indulgence of the Audience.
