Sheridan’s excellent Comedy, The School for Scandal, was played here last night. Mr. W. Fsrren, Mr. Fawcett, Mr. C. Kemble, Mr. Wardc, Miss Chester, and Mrs. Gibbs, distinguished themselves,— The Pantomime followed, to a good house.

Last night after Sheridan's play of The Critic n new Farce entitled The Haunted Inn, was produced. Wc cannot mistake the Author, the puns and situations ¡It once discoTer Mr. Peaks t like all his other productions it has good comic situations, and being written for parti-eatar actors, such acthra loo as Mathews and Liston, it could scarcely fail of success. The plot is not very newan extravagant young officer, Captain Levant, (Jones) in older to escape an arrest, changes clothes with his servant Corporal Trot (Mathews,) Captain Lovant.as the Corporal, goes to the village inn, where he is received ns a common soldier, although wearing a quizzing glass and retaining the manners of the highest ton. This inn, The Sun and Whalebone, 1b kept by an old couple »to are extremely superstitious, and imagine the bouse haunted : the ghost however, is no other than the waiter Tommy Tadpole, (Liston,) who wishes to frighten the old couple nway in order to obtain possession of the bouse himself; for this purpose he perambulates the inn dressed in n table cloth, and dragging n heavy chain after him, but is discovered by Captain Levant, who sits up to watch, and frightens Tommy by playing ghost himself. The trick, however, succeeds, Tommy gets possession of the Inn, but is played upon by Captain Levant, who threatens to expose him ; by these means he induces him to do all sorts of things that are disagreeable to him. The Corporal meanwhile is succeeding very ill as the Captain, at Sir Tom-kin Probe’s ; lie cannot conceal his vulgarity ; but all embarrassemeuts ate at length, of course, cleared up in tire usual style.
The nctlng was good, but not extraordinarily so ;—the Farce was received without disapprobation ;—it will bo rnucli improved by curtailment. The Pantomime concluded —The bouse was full
There is a new Opera in active preparation at this house, with new Scenery, fee.
THE THEATRIOAA OBSERVER,
<$pcra ^ou$fe.
French Theatre.—We were delighted with the performance of Pcrlet, last evening, in Le Précepteur dans l'embarras, and Les Aï-glaises pour rire* The quietness of style in French Comedy is always one of its greatest excellences, but in Perlet it becomes a positive beauty. He does every thing in appearing to do nothing. The sufferings of the Précepteur by this very perfection, become more real the»* those of Farren in Ignatius Polyglot, the English version of the same part ; and in the character of the young English lady, it is the very essence of the part: his noiseless, modest step, the absence of e1* action, the quietness with which the rudest actions are done, although repeated, are real specimens of profound observations of nature. Wc congratulate the English public on possessing the opportunity of witnessing such an artist, and we strongly recommend all those of our own actors, who can conceive in themselves any hardness of style, to study Perlet’8 acting as the most useful corrective.
Olympic—This evening, Casco Bay, with Love in Disguise, and the popular new Pantomime.
Adblphi.—This Evening, Paris in London, First Love, and the Pantomime.
To the Editor of The Theatrical Observer.
Dear Mr. Editor— Just wish to say a word—beg pardon, hope 1 don’t Intrude—but will you excuse me—I have to mention, that I’ve arranged so a* to i uh shoulders with my friends, and the fashionable world, at one or other of the Grand Lounges about town. Now, inay I beg the favor—pardon the liberty— never like ! to be troubtesome—but would you be so kind, from time fo time— just for the information of my friends—as to allow your most useful Periodical to become the channel for announcing to them where t may be met with on the several days of the week. Monday—I saunter to the Diorama, where one U most agreeably lost in a Fog, and where we can, in imagination, ramble to St. Cloud, and the Environs of Paris. About two I pop into the Cosmorama, where the Conflagatlon Is really alarming, and where one can enjoy Shade and Sunshine, and the beauties of variegated Scenery, with the utmost delight. Tuesday—I loiter about the Quadrant—generally drop in at my old friend Alexander Lee's Music Warehouse—think it very superb—find him busy composing a new Opera. Wednesday I shall he found, with my Spectacles off. admiring the truly
Srand display of the Wonders of Nature—l don’t mean the Naturals called ops; but the Microscopic Wonders,exhibited by Mr. Carpenter,the Optician, in Regent Street. Afterwards l shall look in on Mr. Finn, in the same street, at his Fancy Glass-working Exhibition—an ingenious pretty Workshop.—On Thursday—I qualify Mrs. P—’s discordant notes with some harmony divine, and may be found between 1 and 4 o’clock at the Apollonicon ; and on our return, aometimes, drop in to examine Miss Linnood's beautiful Needle-Work- Friday 1 wandered as far as the city—met Young Rodwell—told me his last new Song of Stop Thief; or, the Stolen Heart sells prodigiously—promised to go hear his Music in Paris and London—liked It very much—perceive its published— ■lire to sell. On Saturday, I pop into one of the Green-rooms, where 1 lounge, listen, and laugh for an hour ; and then—but I Intrude—beg pardon.
Your’s, PAUL PHY.
P. S. When any new arrangement occurs, will let you know.

Btw Christmas pantomime at this house, wa» very aucceaafu lttt night, and we have uo doubt that it will bare a considerable run. Of course the mechanism id the undertaking will improve after a few night«’ reprtacntatloo ; but oinking no more than du* allowance for ita complication and consequent dtfficul ty, the wheels, pnlieya, screw«, levets, and wedges, did their
duty with good effect. We confess we are aorae few years too	w
old tborqugkly to relink a pantomima. An far aa etjoymsnt, v OJP fjff-j, , ; * and aven perhaps just estimation, an account of on* ought to be written by a hoy of fourteen, from hoarding-school ; and we war* fortunately able in some degree to measure the delight we •light to have received, by aitting }uat behind two laila, who at timaa were aliuoat in eonvulaiona of transport. We probably should have liked Harlequin better when be wet a joker, than n*w when lie 1« only a jumper; but we heve no doubt there la a eaat deal of msrlt In hlaaal-tatlons, and aure we are that there tnuat be an inexhaustible quantity of fun in the Bounding slap», and heelaover-haad knock-down blows received s* repeatedly by the Clowns and Pantiloona. The beat of it is, that these are jokaa which never Mini to tire.
There is e very old dramatic entertsiomrnt founded upon the

printed hla production, which ii extremely well aoited to the pur puae excepting that it ia fall of puns, not one of which, by anycherce, told, and. in fact,all wit, but that of n more practical kind, must be thrown away on auchan cccaalon. We shall only criticise it by remarking that there it a good deal in it about “ double X «!«,” “ put« of porter," and •* waate-bntta t” and, as Lord Byhon wrote bis Don Juan apon gin, so It seems very probable that Mr. W. BahuvMOHv, penned bis Pantomime, like WeLsreu’s poems, upon brer. The actuary was so varied and extensive that it could aot he Included in a Slagle bill of the established six*, tad on* of double dimensions (a double X bill tube purchased at double ex-pence) was issued for the occasion.
Tbs eiews exhibited ware of ftrat-rst* excellence ; we never witnsteed each a splendid and tasteful succession; and the nets Diorama, with " 8t»npisi.dV moving Picture,” was so admi' rabiy painted, with such truth and spirit, that first-rate et we knew this artist to be, we were not prepared for such a dia pley. One pa>t of the exhibition waa unprecedented—we mean the meaner in which the manoeuvre« of the shipping were conducted • they sailed before the wind, or tacked agalnat It, with the greatest nautical «kill; and the scene of the Cowes Regatta wae one of the snost lively and refreshing xea-icapee ever painted. Th* Port and Clry of Constantinople was more than «>■ promised even In tb* double-bill; so that, at all treats, the Manager was well disposed to give satisfaction.
Th* stery we did aot very dearly make out, ner what the Qu«wn and other Bees had to do with Harleqnin, Colombia*,
,ad th* rest of tb* pantomimic charsetera ; nor did w* quite think in good tnete th* mixture, tn the opening, of crestuies dressed to Imitate bees, and ersaturea dressed to Imitate men abd women How they no* together, and wbat the drone, who (to ns# Mr.W. Bsnirvat. sr.’s words} “ neverbehavesIn bee-Attnrxal beheicr him,” had to do with th* reet of tha characters, we did not understand, but wa dare say others did, and that our Ignoranra «rose from our inattention Tb* manner in which we ere introduod to tbs Harlequin family, consisting of an overgrown father, w> over-aged mother, an over-tall ton, and two or three near noisy children of the tame motley breed, la quite naw and very arouaing. The model« which the real Harlequin of tfaa piece a tenia tha magic awnrdis rathtr burglarious and an-diguifl but it it novel, end that it a great recommendation.
'The ac> « ail exerted thetnaehr*« to tb* utmost, hut Harlequin, C .umblne, the flown«, &c., sink into InsigniAcaace when compared with the "pictorial etabtlllabments.” Mr.
Howku. is a little clumsy, and Miss liYai. not very grateful, hat Messrs. UttfBR and Soutmbv were very agile end amusing JR '&.	'
Certainly the most extraordinary eahlbition of the night was th* American Dwarf—a human being, whose arsne serve bun' Hm ’■*«4P Instead of legt, end U ey had need to do so, for bit legs ere only two or three inches long.
