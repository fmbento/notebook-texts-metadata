The Editor of THE THEATRICAL SPECTATOR regrets, that in consequence of Mr. ELLISTON having announced a Grand Entertainment to be given at Drury Lane Theatre on thé I8th of June, « commemorative of the Anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo,” he will be under the necessity of pointing out to the Public in his Next Paper, Number 7, on Saturday May 26, the gross impropriety of keeping up, by a
THEATRICAL EXHIBITION,
THE MEMORY OF A _ _
Dreadful Day of BLOOD ! ! !
