• OR, THE TWO PETERS.

It is well known that Peter the Great of Russia, ansi.ni! to improve his subjects in the Art of Shiptiuildins, eoutrived to elude the jealous pol cy of the DateM»SoVernros«tt and was received under a
disguised name into the Royal Dock-yard at Snardam (where the scene lies) « here he worked for
several months as a common Shipwright undiscovered ; by his atlable manners h* oruiliated the at".
lections of his fellow workmen, nmil.u* of whom were induced by his fiaUei ag representations of
the state of things in Russia, to desert ft am Sanrdam mid repair to ('etei&burgh---during his absence
n dingerous conspiracy was formed against his throne and life, by his sister the Princess Sophia, to
whom he had confided the reins of Government. The C'otirta of France and Germany having through
their spies discoveied his abode, stud thither their Ambassadors, to endeavour to entrap him, but
Petei's well-known vigilance and wisdom defeated Ihrir project". These and other bhtoiical facts

On FRIDAY Evening, December 26th, 1828,
Will be acted the Tragedy of

GEORGE

Barnwell.

This affecting Tragedy, (the morel tendency of which his been so useful to t h . risinggeneration,) may
be depended upon aa founded on faet. The unfortunate Hero of the Piece was executed for the murder
of his virtuoua and venerable Uncle, i* the reign of Queen Elizabeth | to which be was instigated by an
artful and abandoned woman. Step by step she led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which
terminated a miserable existence by the most igaominous death,
A story is recorded, (and the ftict can be proved by many living witnesses,) that a young gentleman of
the city ef London, having embezzled part of Ma master's property, was providentially at a representation of GCOBGK B A S i n i t , at Drury-Lane Theatre, at whose fate lie was so struck, that it caused his immediate reformation.
The gentleman, benefitted by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to
acknowledge his obligation to the Flay and the Performers; for, at the next Benefit, the
principal Performer received One Hundred Pounds sterling, with a card to the fallowing effect: —
Data Sis,
" (»oe who is iadehted to your admirable Representation of George Barnwell for more than Life, for
his redeemed honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the enclosed, which you will receive yearly, ao
long as you are in the I >n« ofyour profession. Happy am t to acknowledge, that TH« STJOB has prevented me from Ruin and Disgrace;—George Barnwell etopped me in my wild career, and saved me from
an ignominious death.

Mr Nicholson begs respectfully to acquaint the Patrons of the Theatre and Public in general,
that he is unable to afford them the gratification he intended by

MISS HUGHES'
Performance, aa that lady, having broken through two Engagement! and changed the week
fixed for her Appearance in Newcastle, has now a third time disappointed him, assigning ill
health aa the ground for not fulfilling her agreement. The Theatre, which has been closed a
fortnight on her account, will be re-opened therefore without her. Several new and interesting
pieces have been prepared in the inteival, and will be produced during the three nights of performance next week, when tlje Manager trusts he will be honoured with the patronage of the
Inhabitants, whom it is his anxious study to please.

AMBROSE
GWINETT;
OR, A SEA SIDE STORY.
The Melo-Drama Is founded upon an historical fact in the reign of Queen Anne. Ambrose Gwinett
".-»* innocently accused, condemned, and executed for the murder of a persen who had unacountablj
disappeared ; the weapon of the supposed victim was found in the hand of Gwjntlt, ever- circumstance
that could criminate a man arose against him, and he was supposed to have been executed.—Gwinett
!hu««]e«ciibe*, in bis homely way, the scene on the scaffold—><for my own part my mind,(Heaven help
m» I) was, with long agitation become «o unfeeling, that I was in a manner insensible to ever* object ibout
trie: I therefote heard the sheriff whisper the executioner to make what dispatch be could, without the
least emotion, ara suffered him to tie me to the fatal beam, unconscious of what he was doing.—I can
fire no1 account of myself while I was hanging, only that 1 remember, after being turned off, something
for aw -! e appeared about me Itke a blaze offire,nor do I know how long I hung; no doubt the violence
of the weather favoured me greatly in that circumstance. What I am now going to tell you, 1 learned
fr"in my Brother, which was, that after having hung about half an hour, the sheriff's officers all went
- if. !>"<] 1 was cut down by the executioner, but whan he came to put the irons upon me, it was found a
i ti |t' hid been made, and that the irons of the other man, which were much too large for me, had
beet « nt instead of mines th,« they remedied as well as they could, by stuffing clothes between my body
and H>e hi ops that surrounded it j after which I was taken according to my sentence to the place appoint.
< mid hone Upon « gibbet, which was ready prepared! the cloth over my face b«ing slightly tied, and
M*lf.tr Ag no pressure fiom the iron, which stood a great way from It, was soon, 1 suppose, detached
I ii v* 'i d. which » n atill rather violent, and probably its blowing on my bare face expedited my r*Crtrety i ^.r »m it i«, that in this tremendous situation I came to myself."—-The after-fate of the nnforte iSnn v.a» no less astonishing.

It will be readily seen that the Incidents of Gwinett's History present the most powerful
attractions to the dramatist, in the earlier part of the Melo-Drama.

Act l.—Gwinett's Escape from the Press Gang
ASbrda Grayling the means of satiating his vengeance en his Rival; his revenge leads to the

MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF COLLINS.
And subsequently to the

Apprehension of Gwinett as the Murderer.
Act Q.—THE TRIAL OF THE CULPRIT.
Gwtn.tt is sentenced to death, and other circumstances are associated with the fate of the
supposed assassin, which still further serve to display

THE VENGEANCE OF GRAYLING,
Who is triumphing over the fate of his victim aa the prison bell announces

MR. NTCHOtSON takes this opportunity of expressing
his regret tint any circumstance should have occurred to give
offence to the Propriet. r^, He understands some sort of publication has been sent directed to each Proprietor, and which
they suppose to have emanated from him.

He begs leave,

most wh.mnly, on his reord and honour, to declare his utter
ignoranee of it in every sh pe: he knows not who wrote it,
or sent it; nor is he any way privy to it, or concerned in it.
So far from wishing them to kci p away, he feels regret at not
ieeing them in the Theatre,

Gaining a Pardon for Her Husband,

She heroically sets out on Foot with her Infant Son, attended by a faithful Sereattt, to release her Lord. Tbe treacherous Villain QstroflF wit!

band! whom he has doomed to fell a victim to hi. Arts. But by the aid of Brandt,

Like the famous freebooter of merry England, he mingled mirth with his malefactions ; and those who paid dearest for his pranks, were often the first to laugh at his humour. He was
full of chivalry and romance; and his mode of detention and abstraction, particularly towards the ladies,
was iu such good taste that they were fain to admire his gallantry, and celebrate his exploits in their songs.

ibe above celebrated Nautical Drama is founded on a tale of terror: the B-ix Root:; or, "tntfwape Rock," «. It i*
more commonly oesignaled bv Mariners, is a sunken Rock, off the north-east coast or Scotland, and .as former); -err dangerous to Sailors. The Abbots of Aberbrotbock, a religious foundation in tbe neighbourhoood, caused a large Bell to be
erected on the float, near to the Rock, so as t. ring by the agitation of the sea, and by this simple mean* to indicate to tbe
bewildered Seamen the perilous situation in which he wa< placed. There is a tradition current among tbe inhabitant* of
the coast that the Bell was cut from thefloatand stolen, and that the person who committed this nefarious act afterwards
met his fate by Shipwreck, on this very Rock, during a dark and stormy night. On this tradition the pretest Drama is
constructed, and the,great success it has bitherto experienced, proves that it has been executed with no common knowledge
el Dramatic interest and ffect.

PROGRAMME.

Peter Wilkins, with John Adams, Phelim O'Scudd, and Nicodemus Crowquill, «et out on a Voyage ot Discovery,
ire taken prisoners off the Portuguese settlement of Goa, and confined tor several months; whence, in conjunction with
many ethers, they make their escape, and boarding a richly laden vessel bound to the Indies, tail from their enemies: but
nut understanding the navigation of tbe Pacific, tbey are wrecked on a rock of Loadstone, called tbe MAGNET ROCK, where
every soul is supposed to be lost, Peter and Adams being expert swimmers, gain the land, which they find to be most fertile,
•bonuding in lakes stored with fish, forests of game, and rivulets of the purest water. The ship De La Cruz being forced
on the sands by the powerful attraction of the rock, all her lading remains strewed on tbe shore. Peter and John exploring
their way, come to that part where she is lying—tbey build a hut, furnish it with stores, and are comparatively bappv.
After passing near three weeks on tbe Island, Peter is astonished to find a lovely female lying at the door of his but in ' •>.
trance. Me takes ber in, and by his care she is restored to herself. He is subsequently informed she is of a race called
Gawries, possessing the power of flying, but that trying with her sister to catch the living creatures of the water, a fierce
savage darted on them, and by his ruthless grasp so disabled her that she could not re ascend the air. She implores his prelection—they are mutually surprised and delighted. Many extraordinary escapes ensue from the wild man; also various incidents in the meeting of Peter with bis companions O'Scud and Crowquill, till the arrival of the Chief of the Colombats.
Yaurawkee's father and his tribe| who understanding from bis daughter the wonderful weapons Peter is possessed of, prevaita on him to accompany them to the LAND OF FLIOHT, for the purpose of overcoming an implacable foe: Peter contents, and the piece concludes with the Laska or Slave Bearers carrying Peter Wilkins on bis reriat voyage, surrounded
by the whole race of Flying Indians.

No parson has excited public curiosity in a higher d~gre* than has Maaisront, no ttory has bjeo read with greyer
avidity than the one detailing the life and fate of this celebrated

BANDIT OF THE APPENINES,
and the interest of that story has been heightened in no trifling dtgree by viewing THE HEROIC CONDUCT Of*
HIS WIFE. In the following dramatic version of this tale, the troth has been adhered to as nearly at possible, and
where Action has been blended, it has only been done with a view to heighten that stage effect so essentially necessary to Mela-dramatic compotltion, without in the least Injuring the narration itself s in viewing the piece, th* auditor
is divided which to admire most—the continual dangers which encircle Matisroni, and which with the utmost resolution he endeavours to surmount, the devoted fidelity of his wife, or th*

ROYAL

MENAGERIE

Indisputably the most rich, grand, and complete Collection of Foreign Animals ever known to travel through any
part of the World, and is now offered for the Inspection of Amateurs, Connoisseurs, and the Public ; by which
an opportunity is afforded of viewing, at one glance, almost every kind of extraordinary, rare, and valuable
Quadruped that ever crossed the Ocean, such as have always been considered leading objects of Exhibition.
. INCLUSIVE O P SEVERAL ANIMALS, ENTIRELY NEW T O T H I S COUNTRY.

THE PERFORMING

LION & TIGERS,
IN O N E D E N ;

Indisputably the most sin-ular instance of Savage Ferocity tranquilt-ed into Animal Discipline. The LION, in his wild state, is universally allowed t i be King; of the Forest: no Animal will willingly attack him—His flowing main, majestic appearance, with his tremendous rearing tike
thun ler, strike terror into the rest of the Quadrupeds. The TIGER, next to the LIO V, it the most tremendous of the feline tribe; and, whilst he
p o s s e s s all the bad qualities of the former, seems to be an pntire stranger to his jrood ones
To pride, strength, and courage, the LION adds
greatn-ss, an I sometimes clemency ; whilst the TIGER, without provocation, u fierce, and without necessity is cruel; instead of instinct he bath
nothing but an uniform rage, a blind fury; so blind indeed, so undistinguishing, that he frequently devours his own progeny, and if the TIGRESS
offers to defend them, he will even tear the dam herself to pieces.

2 REAL WAPETIES,
Or, Gigantic Stags of Missouri, (Male and Female.)
The VVAPETI are very e-traordinsry non-descript Animals, of the Cervus or Deer genus; but as large as the Horse, and nearly as gentle
as the Lamb, as they will caress their Visitors, and receive food from their hands. It is remarkable that the WAPETI have scarcely been mentioned by anv European Naturalist, and the history of them is consequently very limited: they were first introduced to the United States, at Baltimore by a German Naturalist, who was employed some years in exploring the Upper Missouri, where they are domesticated by the Indians,
and draw sledges at the rate of SO miles an hour, and supply them with the most delicious venison. Their form unites perfect symmetry and
elegance, the sine of the race b>rse, with activity surpassing- the Greyhound; they have horns nearly 5 feet in length, which weigh upwards of
41 pounds. Their colour is, in winter, on the body, of a peculiar dunnish hue, the neck and legs are of a dark brown, a, black semicircular line
of unequal width, from a quarter of an inch ta two inches, separates the white of the rumn from the dun of the body: their summer coat is thin,
and the colour a reddish grey. The head resembles that of a common American Deer, and of the HorSe, and is pointed and haadsome. Their.
legs are formed f »r strength and activity : on the outside of each is a protuberance of yellowish hair, which is the seat of a glan I tint contains an
mictions matter, which the animal applies to smooth and dress its coat; and when so dressed, it is impervious to rain or to water, though it swim
across a river. The WAl'E IT has a cloven foot, and chews the cud like an Ox, yet he has the bridle tusk like the Horse, and can be operated
on by the bridle and bit. The tongue is remarkably soft and smooth. These animals, whose aboriginal name is that of WAPETI, are known
to the Settlers of North America by the name of the Elk ; and are supposed to be of the same species as the Great Antediluvian Elk, whose enormous fossil remains are frequently found in that country, and of which specimens may be found in the British Museum.

the Keeper tt snter the Den The BOA-CONSTRICTOR is the most conspicuous of all Serpents, from its prominent superiority of Beauty
and Colon* and its enormous Siae, as it is alien f.sund 60 feet in length. This appears incredible ; but Ragulus, the Roman General, and Alexander the Great assert that they were stopped by a Serpent of the same kind, with their powerful Armies.

HFROM THE RIVER NILE

NYLGHAU,

Acknowledged by Connoisseurs to be the most elegant Quadruped of Hmdosttn, about 14 hands hi«h, of a moat graceful shape and elegant appearance • he has two short Horns growing immediately over his Eyes, which give him the appellation of the HORNED HORSE. It seems
to partake of the species of the Horse, Cow, and Antelope, and is in every respect an admirable production of Nature's Wonderful Works.

A BEAUTIFUL ZEBRA,
It» which it seems as if the Works of Art had Iwen combined with those of Nature in thia wonderful production. In symmetry of Shape, and
beauty of Colours, it is the most elegant of all Quadrupeds ever beheld j uniting the gracefulness of the Horse, with the fleetness of the Stag, and
is most beautifully Striped Black and White.

AMONG WHICH W I L L BE FOUND AN IMMENSE FULL-GROWN

FROM THE COAST OF BARB ART,

The sight of which instantly impresses every beholder with that magnificent idea so generally conceived of the King of the Brute Creation ; his
f.rm is strikingly bold and majestic, having a larjfe shaggy Mane, which he erects at his pleasure, and which, with his tremendous roaring, like
d'ttin' ejaps of taumler cartaot fail to inspire the mind with feelings of awe and astonishment, that no won'w can describe.

LIONESSES,

Menagerie,

Which grand Collection was exhibited, by special Command, at Winsdor, on the 27th of October, 181<5, before her kte Majesty, the Princesses,
and the Duchess of Yurie, the Bishop of Salisbury, General Taylor, and a Number of other distinguished Characters, who allowed the»e Animals
to be the finest they had ever seen.

FOURTEEN

LIONS

Among which are Two Beautiful LIONESSES, one of which Whelped FOUR CUBS at Beverley, on the 24th
Feb. 1821, and the other Whelped FOUR on Whit-Sunday, 18S0 ; the whole are to be seen in perfect health.
The STUPENDOUS and SAGACIOUS

ELEPHANT
Ten Feet high, and upwards of Ninety-six

Hundred-weight.

The Elephant, the human race excepted, is the most respectable of Animals. Iu size he surpasses all other terrestrial Creatures, and by far ex.
ceeds any other travelling Animal in England; he has Ivory Tasks, four feet long, one standing out on each side of his Trunk. His Trunk serve*
him instead of hands and arms, with which he can lift up and seize the smallest as well as largest objects. He alone drags Machines which six
horses cannot move. To his prodigious strength he joins Courage, Prudence, and an exact obedience. He remembers favours as long as injuries;
in short, the sagacity and knowledge of this extraordinary Animal is absolutely beyond any thing Human Imagination can possibly suggest; He
will lie down and get up at the word of Command ! notwithstanding the many fabulous Tales of their having no joints in their legs; he has very
small eyes, comparatively with his enormous size, but they are sensible and lively, and he can distinguish the smallest Object. He will take a
sixpence from the floor and place it in a Box he has in the Caravan, bolt and unbolt a Door, take his keeper's Hat off, and replace it, and by the
command of hia Keeper will perform so many wonderful Tricks, that he will not only astonish and entertain the Spectators, but justly prove him
die half reasoning Beast. He is the only Elephant now travelling that is adorned with Tusks. His consumption of Hay, Corn, Straw, Carrota,
Water, &c exceeds 700 Pounds Daily. A ROYAL BENGAL

T I G E R & TIGRESS,
A singular instance of savage ferocity tranquillized into animal Discipline. In size and strength, the Tiger is inferior to none of the ferocious
or carnivojous kind of animals, and for beauty of colony and shape, exceeds the whole of that tremendous class. The Tigress lately produced
TWO CUBS at Brighton, in June last, which were exhibited before the Nobility and Gentry residing there at that time, who were highly gratified
<m viewing the same, as such an occurrence never happened in this country before.

may not enable Mr DUCROW to visit this District
