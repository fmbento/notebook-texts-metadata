The Management, zealous in every thing that can contribute to public accommodation, has availed itself of the short Easter recess in teaming and ventilating the Interior ;—in lighting the House by a new and splendid CHANDAL1ER; and in beautifying and decorating the saloon.
The STOV ES which have been constructed, upon a new principle, exclude the cold and rate Air, and introduce into the body of the House a mild and refreshing temperature; while the active and powerful Ventilator draws off the damps, and renders salubrious the auditory part of the Theatre.
The new brilliant Chandalier, lighted by Gas, is an improvement upon every thing that has hitherto appeared,—it sheds a clear, soft, and beaming Light over the House, neither obstructing the sight, or diminishing the interest of the Stage.
The Saloon has undergone a thorough and complete change, and will be opened at usual, for the accommodation of the Half-price Company.

Mr. CARR,
Mr CARR, (so humbly situated in Rank, as ten Actor, but whose Duties during the wlible of this Season behind the Curtain, in tire Department of the Stage, have been > both incessant and laborious) feels it incumbent an him respectfully to slate to the Publick, that, in putting up his Name for a Benefit, he is impelled to the seeming Presumption of so doing, by the most pressing, and othencise insurmountable Difficulties, occasioned by an unfortunate Speculation, he had embarked in previously to his becoming a Member of Drury Lane Theatre, the Consequenaes of -which, after proving an Infliction of continued Embarrassment to him for some ■.Years, now absolutely threaten to overwhelm those Efforts in life he has been ^strenuously making for a Family of Twelve Children, all nmv living, and Ten * of whom are resident under his Roof and entirely dependant on his Exertions.
These Considerations have induced the Gentlemen of the .Sul)-Committee most tkindly to offer Mr. Carr the use of the Theatre for this Evening; and his Theatrical Brethren, amongst whom Mr. ELLISTON has ranked himself, have .with themwst unanimous and zealous Promptitude volunteered the aid of their 1 alents gratuitously on this Occasion, to which the Patronage ofdhe Publkk is trtosb respectfully and earnestly solicited.	_
