ORDER OF THE DAY.
This Dram* it founded on *n interesting incident related by Thiebuuit—At the dose of an unsuccessful campaign, Frederick the Second, surrounded by Marshal Daun, and on the ere of being forced to a general action, on which might depend his life and empire, issued an order, forbidding the use of fire or light, after sunset, on pain of death ; the extremity of the case, snd the well known severity of the king, left an offender without hope of pardon ; yet, notwithstanding the peril to be incurred, a young Captain of the Royal Guard, newly married, and who had promised to communicate tidings of his safety daily to his wife, ventured to break the order in foct, though not in spirit. Whilst thus employed, he was surprised by Frederick, who forced the unfortunate young man to conclude his letter with the fatal tidings of the approaching death his breach of discipline had subjected him to.

THE NOYADES:
Or, The Jftaid of •
The Conventional Decree, in ! 792, “ which supported their declaration of war by acompalaory levy of three iiundred thousand men tliroughout France, was regarded as intolerable by the Vendeans, averse alike to the Republican cause and principles. The) resisted its exaction by main lorcr, delivered the Conscripls in many instances, defeated the National Guards in others, and, finding that the) had incurred the vengeance of a sanguinary Government, resolved by force to maintain the resistance which in force had begun. Thus originated that celebrate l war, which raged so long in the very bosom of France, and threatened the stability of her Government, even while ti»e Republic w as achieving the most brilliant victories over her foreign enemies,’.'—“ At first their arms,' the Vendeans, were of the most simple and imperfect kind. Fowling-pieces, and fujccs or every calibre, they possessed from their habit» as huntsmen and fowlers; for close encountei they had only scythes. axe% clubs, ami such weapons as anger places most readily in the hands of the peasant.*’—“Tire Vendeau took the field with the greatest simplicity ol military equipment. His terip served as a cartridge-box ; his uniform was the country short jacket and pantaloons, which he wore at Jus ordinary labour; a cloth knapsack contained bread and some necessaries, and thus he was ready lor service."—“ Instead of drums or military music, they used, like the ancient Sw iss and Scottish soldiers, the horns of cattle for giving signals to their troop». Their officers wore, for distinction, a sort of chequcicd red handkerchief knotted round their heads, w ith others of the same colour tied round their waist, by Way of »ash, in which they stuck their pistol»."—This remarkable civil war broke out in the beginning of March, 1793, and La Charette’s execution, by which it was closed, took place at Nantes, 29th March, 1796."—** Wc have mentioned the murders committed at Lyons; but even these, though hundreds w ere swept away by vollies of musket shot, fell short of the horrors perpetrated by Carrier nt Nantes, who, in avenging the Republic on the obstinate resistance of La Vendée, might have summoned hell to match his cruelty, without a demon venturing to answer his challenge. Hundreds—-men, women, and children—were forced on board ol vessels, w hich were scuttled and sunk in the !«oire, and this was called Republican Baptism.’’—These punishments were also called Noyades.

Nau baucklish !—Here it is ! this is the spot that puts new life into Paddy !—It is meat, drink, washing. and lodging into the bargain for n week Don’t it look beautiful ?—and an’t the design elegant and grand. Be aisy ! aisy ! None of your bother man. sure there is no design about it at all at all ; it is nothing else but a rude yet pleasing sketch of nature, and isn’t put together in a jiffy, and pulled to pieces after the manner of a whirlwind like the baseless fabric of a vision which leaves not—no matter—but ub to its aucijitkcturk, my jewel, lets have no pride about that future—but its Daddy and Mammy are the Snow Folks !—Don’t Paddy’s Dictionary tell you to—go it—keep it up—get over the ground—make use of your peepers—laugh while you can—make the most of your time—and remember that Donnybrook Fair only comes once a year.
" Search the whole Globe,” observed Pat Mainmast, “ and it is only at Donnybrook Fair that you can see the like of it, where it is all-
iiospitalitj !
AH reality,
And no formality.
You said formality ! by the powers of Moll Kelly is it not do as you like?—Plaiec yourselves!—Free and aisy !—Love for love to the end of the chapter. O ’tis dc spot for unbending the Min»—where the Soul’s afloat with raptures, and the Spirits on the qui vive. It is at Donnybrook where the Grbat Folks come in cog. and the in cog. sort of people at horne’launch out into Grkat Folks—it is Nature dressed in her merriest mood—Judy O’Callaghan is as great as my Lady Mayoress—and will push herself into society without any introduction, crying out ** Paddy, my Boy, is it not all fair at fair time.”— To be sure it is my jewel—I’d be glad to know who doubts it while I have a bit of shillela in my fist.— You know the Knowlans and Dowlans are not particular to a shade who they mix with at Donnybrook as to pedigree. An’t 1 ray father’s son—and isn’t that passport enough here for a good fellow 1 'That’s true my hearty, and I’ll bet the Hill or Howth to a Pea, Donnybrook Fair against the world for Fun, Frolic, Gaiety, and Friendship—’tis the Annual Jubilee of an Irishman, and those that don’t believe me may put it into their pipe and smoke it without they prefer a cigar. “ Aisy, aisy, although an Irishman loves to spake his mind he wishes to be polite at the same time.” Why ? Bekase civility costs nothing.
Then Pht he went to Donnybrook to see the glorious fun,
And Judy she run after him as sure as a gun ?
To exchange the glance, join the dance, all gay and frisk ey ! Sure Ould Ireland's the place for jollity and whiskey.
To be sure it is—ichacx-rowdy-dow !
LIFE ON A RACE COURSE, or, ,U8Rr

So make your game.—" I say the pea is under that thimble sporting Mary !”—You say, fellow ! You never had a say in your whole life ; and if you had say—a chap without money is of no use at a race ; so stand aside you poor fellows, and make loom for those gentle men who feel inclined to sport a little cash to k*#*p the game alive.”

Glorious fascinating delusion !—This is the best test, of its excellence, and one of the finest Mirrors of Human Nature ever witnessed.
LIFE IN THE FIELD !—Hark forwards ! See the game its in view ! Tom, Jerry, and Logic enjoying the pleasures of Hunting. Animated description of a Fox-chase ! Jemmy Green rfi/rA-ed, his Nunter bolted, and symptoms of being thrown out: Jerry quite at home (singing)

(S'j' Amongst flic numerous Alterations and Improvements, that have been effected in this Commodious Theatre, none appear to have given greater satisfaction, than the apportioning

LATTICES OR UPPER 80XES.
I he comfort of that portion of the Pul «He, who frequent the Pit, is by this arrangement materially consulted, as it gives additional room, and effectually secures them from unseasonable iii.erruptiou.
The Price of Admission to the LATTICES will be the same as the PIT.

Superstition being the order of the day, the inhabitant« flocked in greot number* to the abode of old Mother Holly, a fiunotiH hand in witchcraft, near unto the Haunted Fen. ’I be old fortttrUMellcr, foreseeing the impo*"dbiHty of the KtuTb rommunri being earri«*d into effect at this period, as she had known similar efforts «if former Karls failing in the like unjust taxation, took ujmn herself to free them from the same, provided the fee should l>e paid before sho gave her oonusel. I bis was done most joyous!v, when she bade them seek one Tmu, tho Coooer of Coventry, whose courage nnd good name, with the townspeopb, would soon effect their object, and put an end to all their trouble*“. T hey repaired to Tom’* house. In the High-street, Coventry, where they found him superintending his men, and occasionally making love to Miss Kdith, (the Mayor s Daughter) whose house stood facing that of his own. On being made acquainted with the new Tax, he signed the petition against it, and promised his aid, with that of his men and friends, to oppose the demand of the Enrl. At tb** moment the tax - collector entered the very stTeel and applied to Tom for pnymeut. Tom U>ok the hook, »ml in one instant Ratter.***! the head of the poor little collector within its page« The authorities were called in—the Hitiuilt eomme need--the Mayor was not heard to read the riot act—the collector was bunged up iu one of Tom’s tnlm—-and the whole night was spent inglorious achievement* of the dti/en-4 of Coventry. On the following morning, the F.nrl of Mercia arrived at Berkh«instead Castle, (with hi* aorruptnc frmrrt) when, seated at the htMKjuet table with his wife, itn imdwnee wa* solicited by the people of Coventry.—It was granted. Tim* petition iteing placed at the feel of the Karl, he most strenuously refused granting the same ; but, through the entreaties of bis lovely i.udy liis heiirt inclined more to love than justice, granted their quest, but with this understanding,—
That f.july Godlm should ride through the Towo Without any dress, any \eil or a gown.
She replied—a thought struck her, and at once «In* agrees.
For her hair was so long it came down to her knees.

The old fortune-teller, foreseeing the impossibility of the Earl 's command being carried into effect at this period, as she had known similar efforts of former Earls failing in the like unjust taxation, took upon herself to free them from the same, provided the fee should be paid before she gave her counsel.—This was done most joyously, when she bade them seek one Tom, the Cooper of Coventry, whose courage and good name, with the townspeople, would soon effect their object, and put an end to all their ¡ roubles. They repaired to Tom’s house, in the High-street, Coventry, where they found him superintending his men. and occasionally Making love to Miss Edith, (the Mayor’s Daughter) whose house stood facing that of his own.

I he opening of thin Pantomime represent« the Jiiost|?<trikmg event« in the extraordinary history of Lady Gopiva, and her hnshand I.eokhh , Karl of Mercia, who endeavored to impose an uujust tax on the people of Coventry, in the year 1062. Superstition being the order of the day. the inhabitants flocked in great numbers to the abode of old Mother Holly, a famous hand in witchcraft, near unto the Haunted Fen. The old fortune-teller, foreseeing the impossibility of the Earl's command being carried into effect at this period, h.s she had known similar effort« of former Karls failing in the like unjust taxation, took upon herself to free them from the same, ¡go-\ided the fee should be paid before she gave her counsel. This was done most joyously, when she bade them »«-ek one Tom, the Cooper of Coventry, whose courage and good name, with the townspeople, would soon effect their object, and put an end to all their troubles. They repaired to 'l our'« house, iu the High-street, Coventry, where they found him imperii»tending hi« men. and occasionally making love to Miss Edith, (the Mayor s Daughter) whose house stood facing that of his own On being made acquainted with the new l ux, he signed the petition against it, and promised his aid. with that of his uieu and friends, to oppose the demand of the Earl. At this moment the tax collector entered the very street and applied to'loin for payment. Tom took the book, and in one instant flattened the head of the poor little collector within its pages The authorities were called in—the usault commenced-- the Mayor was hot hr.A hi» to read the riot net—the collector was bunged up in one of Tom s tubs—and the whole night was spent in glorious achievements of the citizens of Coventry. On the following morning, the Earl of Mercia arrived at Herkhainstead Castle, (with his porcupine guard) when, seated at the banquet table with his wife, an audience was solicited by the people of Coventry.-—It was granted The petition lieing placed at the feet of the Earl, he most strenuously refused granting the same ; but, through the entreaties of hi« lovely Lady his heart inclined more to love than justice, granted their finest, but with this understanding,~
That Lady (iodtva should ride through the Town Without any dress, any veil or a gown.
She replied—a thought struck her, and at once she agrees, For her hair was so long it caine down to her knees A proclamation was instantly issued, that every house and window should he closed, and
He who dared to peep or pry, By Mercia's word shall surely die.
