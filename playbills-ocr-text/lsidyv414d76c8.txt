Mrs.Dobbs.
J, DOBBS most respectfully informs his friends and the public, that having invented

A MACHINE
TO E X P E D I T E

REAPING

THE

of

CORN

& c but having been unable to obtain the PATENT till too late to give it a general inspection in the field with safety, he
is induced to take advantage of his Theatrical Profession, and make it known to his friends who have been anxious to
see it, through that mediumPart of the Stage will be PLANTED with WHEAT, & C that the MACHINE has cut and gathered where it grew, and the
Machine worked exactly as in the field.
Any invention that will enable the Farmer to gather bis grain quicker and cleaner than the old method (in our climate
so uncertain) must be a national advantage of no small consideration; that the Machine in question possesses that advantage, will, perhaps, be better decided by its own merits, than anything its author could say in its favour.
