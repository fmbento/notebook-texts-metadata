This celebrated Play is taken from the well .known Novel of

Evening, the Mth of OCTOBER,

Will b* presented, the Dram* of

CHARLES XII
Or the Siege of Strahund.
Voltaire's history of Charles the Twelfth has been aptly called a romance; and a more delightful association of truth and fiction is no wh»re to ba found. The oh*,
t-tetor of this extraordinary monarch exhibits one distinguishing feature, surpassing valour, he courted dangers as others do ease, because it was his jilrasi.ru; and all hi*
•nergias were exerted in the attainment of glory, tnat brilliant bubble, which when we would grasp it, bursts and disappears. To him battle, and sieges were as air and
exercise, t h . spirit-stirring Drum and the ear-piercing Fife a concord of sweet sounds, to which the groans of the wounded and dying formed an accompaniment obligato.
He sought the "bubble reputation" in its ancient quarters, " e ' e n in tne cannon's mouth . " and " grinning honour" on a spot least congenial to laughter and merriment, th«
field of battle. Vet did B E I X O N A play her votary a slipper, trick, and tm> meteor which threateud to destroy the world was as evanescent as effulgent
- Hi9 J'aVL wtu defiiiCd to a barren strand,
A petty fortrem,
and a dubiuut hand."
From the sober page of history, Charles the Twelfth has been transferred to the theatre, an arena where many of h i . illustrious brethren hate strutted tfteir hour in
all the variety of their respective qualities. Mr. Planehe, the author of this drama, has exhibited his Swedish majesty in a very faithful light The character of Charles Is
maintained with spirit and piopriety, his short questions and quick answers are in perfect keeping with the historical picture of that tacitnrn monarch. The Farmer Adam
Brock, is a fellow whose humanity is only equalled by his good humour, blunt, honest, una good-natured; a joker, a smoker, and a laughing philosopher to hoot: for,
with a eoncienc. ever gay, he resolves to let his countenance be its index. Eudiga is humourously treated; her assumption ol the king, and hit at his peculiarities, are extl.rn.ly oomic Much merriment is exited by the busy burgomaster Muddle work, whose brain is an everlasting magazine of plot.,, conspiracies, and chimeras dire: he sees
ut t h . most trivial events something " remarkable:" not a pudding can be boiled but there is treason in the smoke. The other characters in general, contribute to the enter,
tainment, which cannot fail to be derived by those who witness the representation of this excellent production, which ranks among the very best of Mr. PLAMCHK'U drama..

On FRIDAY

Evening

October 29, 1830.

Will be performed, (for this Night only), the admired Nautical Drama of

Blaek-eyed

Susan,

Or AH in the Downs.
This is one of the best Dramas, the Stage has produced for some time I the language is unaffected, forcible
md appropriate; the characters are manly and pleasingly drawn. The incidents follow each other naturally and
dramatically, the interest is extremely well sustained throughout Pity and suspense are alternatly excited, mid unmixed satisfaction attends t W denouement Such has indeed been the result; and the intense interest excited by its
production in London, is without parallel in the annals of the Stage. After an unprecedented run of 250 successive
nights, at a minor Theatre, it has been transferred to the Theatre Royal CoTent Garden, where it still continues to
attract overflowing houses. In short if the merits of the whole Piece are measured by its effects, it cannot fail of en.
Miring the most unqualified approbation.

On Wednesday Evening, NOV. 3, 1830,
Will bo presented, the admired Drama, of

Father &• Son,
Or the Assassin

of The

Rocks.

The domestic drama of F A T H E R anil SON, has buen pronounced by one of the first Clitics of the presen*
day, as a production illustrating most forcibly the effect of G U I L T upon the human mind ; The F A T H E R is led
by imperceptible steps, from a trifling act of duplicity, to the appalling crime of MURDERING HIS FAVOUR I T E C H I L D , the dreadful catrastroplie is only prevented by the interposition of the H A N D of P R O V I D E N C E
shown in the filial affection of the SON to the F A T I I K R , ana the arousing of a feeling of humanity in the breast of
the SAVAGE A N T O I N E , who is charmed by the sight of F E M A L E BEAUTY and protects her when he had
been engaged to M U R D E R her.

To conclude with, for the last time, the Drama of

JBlack-ewed

Susan,

Or AH in-the Downs.
This is one of the best Dramas, the Stage has produced for some time ; the language is unaffected, forcible
and appropriate; the characters are manly and pleasingly drawn. The incidents follow each other naturally and
dramatically, the interest is extremely well sustained throughout. Pity and suspense are alternatly excited, and unmixed satisfaction attends the denouement. Such has indeed been the result J and the intense interest excited by its
production in London, is without parallel in the annals of the Stage. After an unprecedented run of 200 successire
nights, at a minor Theatra, it has been transferred to the Theatre Royal Covent Garden, where it still continues to
attract oveiflowing bouses. In short if the merits of the whole Piece are measured by its effects, it cannot fail of ensuring the most unqualified approbation.

THE CELEBRATED

TRAGEDT OF

G. Barnwell:
LONDON MERCHANT.
*' Be waned ye Youths, who fee my fad defpair,
" Avoid lewd Women, falfe as they aid-fair,"
LILLO.
This affefting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which ti»s been fo'vefy beneficial to the lifing generation,
and is one of t^e Plays lately revived in Drury-Lane.—The Manager thinks he cannot better dilcbarge
,his duty to tfae Public of Cockermouth, than by performing it alfo in this place,
SHAKESPEARE fays, " That guilty creatures fitting at a plav,
" Have, by the very cunning of the icene,
" Been ftruck fo to the (but, that prefently
" They have proclaim'd their malefactions."
HAMLET.
A (lory is recorded, and the faft can be proved by many living witneffes, That a young Gentleman
of London, having embezzled part of his Master's property, providentially at a reprefentation of George
Barnwell, at Drury-Lane, when that admirable a£lor, Mr. Ross,'performed the Chara&er of Barnwell,
he was fo ftruck with remorfe as toeffeft his inftantaneous reformation,—His encomiums or^the Play, and
especially the mafterly manner in which Mr. Rofs delineated the Chara&er of Barnwell, bad the molt
happy effccl; on this gentleman ; and confequently at every yearly benefit of Mr. Rofs, he lent him One
Hundred pounds fterling, with a card to the following Effett :
" Dear Sir, One who is indebted to your admirable reprelentation of George Barnwell, for morte than
life, for his redeemed honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the enclofed, which you will receive
vearly, fo long as you continue in the line of your profeition. Happy am I to acknowledge that the ftage
has preferved me from ruin and difgrace. George Barnwell ftopt me in my mad career, and faved me
from an ignominious death.
I am your grateful friend and fervant,
A CONVERT."
Where inftruftion can be blended with amufement, every good parent will be anxious—every matter
will be defirous—and every teacher will recommend this valuable play to the attention of their pupils.
As it exhorts the'youth of both fexes to the practice of virtue, which even the raoft inveterate enemies of
the Theatre must allow ; furely then it cannot give offence, although Heads of Families and others, are
thus folicited to permit the young under their protection, to fee this moral, inftru&ive, and awful Tragedy of G E O R G E B A R N W E L L ,

" Learn to*d. v well from others ill,
" And you (hall do full well."
Li LLO.
This play, it may be depended upon, was founded on fact.',"the unfortunate hero of the Tragedy,
George Barnwell, was executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerabl. Uncle -, to which he was
mitigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned woman, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth : step by ftep
fhe led the unwary youth, to the last cruel deed which terminated a miferable exiftance by the moft
ignominious death,

AMBROSE

GWINETT;
or, A SEA SIDE SroHK
The following is from the pen of an able Critic :—" This is one of the very best Drama, the Stage hn.
produced for i » c time, and has the rare merit in these translating times of being purely " English from top to
toe." The language ii unaffected, forcible, and appropriate , the characters are manly and pleasingly drawn;
the Incident, follow each other naturally and dramatically ; and the plot is managed with a degree of ease and
•kill not u.ually manifested in modern productions. The interest is extremely well sustained throughout. P i t ,
kvd suspense are alternately excited, and unmixed satisfaction attends the denouement. Founded on fact, the
»-..ln event, of the narrative have been heightened by the introduction of the usual Dramatic concomitants.
The ctrcuusstances which gave birth to this Drama occurred in the Reign of Queen Anne. The story is. well
known and exceedingly well dramatized,."
A laps, of IS Years is supposed to have taken place between the second and third Acts.

TOM
&
JERRY,
Or, LIFE in LONDON.
Putting all comparison out of the question as to the relative merits of the two pieces, TOM and
JERRY must undoubtedly be regarded as the BEGGAR'S OPERA of the present century; its
scenes certainly do not possess any of the brilliant wit, and pungent satire, which sparkle so plentifully throughout the pages of G A Y , but, on the other hand, they are more generally true to
nature, and have none of the disgusting depravity, and undisguised profligacy, that so greatly
alloy the gratification we receive in the company of Macheath and his associates. Both Tom and
Jerry and the Beggars' Opera, owe Iheir success to nearly the same cause—the amusing novelty
and variety of life of their subjects, and the beauty of the music with which they are interspersed;
they have also been equally fortunate io,point of popularity and attraction. If any thing, perhaps
the precedence must be given to Tom and Jeny, as its favour was not confined to the Metropolis,
but extended to every Theatre throughout the United Kingdom, nor was it less forcible in America,
where it is to this day, what is termed a stock piece. It is with pleasure the pioprietor announces,
with the aid of a superior company, stock of dresses, &c. &c. he is enabled to produce this piece in
a superior manner, which he trusts will meet the approbation of an enlightened public.

This interesting piece is founded on Sir Walter Scott's Popular Tale of that name, contained in his
•' CHRONICLES of the CANONGATE." Of all his works which have been Dramatized, few present more '
(raits of the high national sense of honour entertained by the Scottish Nation , of their eager desire of avenging
an insult, of their cool and determined courage, than the above Drama. Their wild and popular superstition of
the second sight is here developed in all its force, giving a high-wrought interest to the character of Elsphat,
while the devoted tenderness of Woman's Love is, if possible, more beautifully portrayed in the young and courageous Martha M'Alpine,—giving to the whole an interest which has rendered it highly popular and attractive.

As performed last season at Drory Lane, with unbounded applause.

T H E N E W SCENERY PAINTED BY MR. THORNE,
ACT I .
The interesting and immediate causes of the great change which eventually took place in the French Regime; the elegant
prodigality and almost incredible nonchalance of the French Nobility, while on the very brink of that precipice which proved
the final destruction of so many families ol rank; their arbitrary and. unjust sacrifice of all younger branches to the aggrandizement of heirship; the splendour and frivolity of their entertainments, even when the abyss was opening under their feet,
i#hile,. as one of their clear-sighted Nobles expressed himself," nos femmes et nos jeunes etourdis de Fa Cour ne voient
dans J'agitation des esprits pu'un moment d'effervescence, et au milieu de ces scenes tumultueuses ne revent que des plaisirs
et futilites!" But this dream of pleasure and futility evaptwates, and with the conclusion of the Act commences the announcement of those horrors, which, for a quarter of a century, made poor France, (as Shakspeare expresses it) " Almost afraid to
know itself *'

ACT M .
While it amply exhibits the demoralized sOfte of the regenerated people when only owning the domination of the Goddess
of Reason, and their absolute slavery and debased servility to leaders who ruled ibei-a under the " Tree of Liberty," and who
converted all the Jeans, Baptistes, Pierres, &c. into Solons, Socrates, and Seneeas, show, also the unshaken constancy, even
unto death, of servants, children, lov.rs, friends, parents, and patriots of the true stamp, whose last and principal consolation, after their hopes in the Deity in whom they trusted, was " Posterity will reap the fruit for which we are sacrificed!"

ACT 1 1 * .
When the eye turns, delighted, to a more cheering scene, and the ameliorating effects of a better order of things begin to
realize the prophetic hopes of former victims; and, in this Act, the fruits and rewards of probity and good conduct afford a
lesson calculated to amend the worst and improve the best in every class of civil society, and an incident calculated to keep an
auditory in breathless yet pleasing suspence to the very fall of the curtain, concludes a Dramatic Melange, of which, much
as we have said, we hope it will prove not more than the subject merits.

PAINTED

HY

MR.

THORNE.

Imagination cannot picture, or the artist's skill scarce paint, the picturesque splendour, the delightful Scenery of the East,
heightened as it is by its peculiar Architecture. Here the Traveller may recognize the Spot endeared to him by taste—the
Sailor the Port where he once sighed at the sweet thought of home; the Fire-side Voyager behold in pictured reality the
Scenes he has so often visited in his waking dreams. The Panorama commences with a View oj

ALGIERS.

This Spot claims the attention, from its late conquest by the French, and our own glorious Bombardment of it, when Slavery
^^
and Piracy fell crushed before the British Flag.

The Shores of Asia,
Town and Isle of Rhodes,

With its magnificent Mountains and Castles gradually lost in the expanse of Ocean, till we behold the

Celebrated as the former seat of that glorious order of Chivalry, called the Knights of Rhodes, who after a l o n g but inefeatual
struggle, fell before the Turks.

T h e European Side of the Bosphorns.
Extending with its many Isles and Mountains beyond the Dardanelles, even to the Capital of Turkey:

CONSTANTINOPLE,
With its hundred Minarets and Spires, its splendid Portals and Mosques, the gorgeous Dome of St. Sophia, its Banks and
stately Palaces, concludes this lovely Picture of the Eastern World.

This Drama embraces that Period of Scottish History when the unhappy MARY became a

V
' Deputation from the Regent of Scotland is sent by the Earls of Lindsey and Ruthven to propose terms, and prevail on her to save her life, by Signing the Abdication of her Throne. Young
George Douglas, enamoured of the Queen, forms a project to assist her flight, which is nearly
accomplished, when the alarm is given, and surrounded by Guards, he draws his sword, rushes
through the Soldiery, and Lady Douglas commands them to fire on him, which is prevented by
the Queen rushing between them. Jasper Dryfsdale, the Steward of Lady Douglas, endeavours to

POISON THE QUEEN
which is prevented by the vigilance of Sandy and Rowland Graeme—Sandy is dispatched for
aswBtance to the Village of Kinross by Lady Douglas, who is fearful of being thought aeeesan
w the Queen's Death, where he meets Young Douglas, and is made the bearer of a communication, signifying that

A Rocket will Ascend from the Village,
m token that the friends of suffering Royalty watch for an opportunity to effect the Escape of the
unfortunate Mary, directing a Light to be placed in the Turret of the Castle, to shew that all is
prepared, for the attempt, without its walls. Her adherents are unable to comply, and while deploring the fallacy of her hopes, Lady Douglas (by accident) enters her apartment, and thus returns
the appointed signal to the Inhabitants of Kinross, who by the

Ascension of a Second Rocket,
announce the Approach of a Boat with young George Douglas.—The Queen and her followers
escape.*—The alarm is given, and the soldiers fire on Douglas, who, (as the shouts from the oppo-^
ute bank declare the safety of the Queen) dies contented in the cause of Scotland and Mary Stuart.

The story of this piece is founded on Bloomfield's poem of the same name, and runs thus : The Miller has gathered under his charitable
and thrifty roof, George, a stout lad, who has been at sea, and Phcebe, an orphan, who has been compelled, from hard treatment, to

Desert her P a r i s h Apprenticeship.
They are mutually enamoured. George has a rival of a splenetic temper in his fellow labourer, Giles. The Miller finding that Love with
its concomitant feuds, does not much enhance the industry or peace of his household, determines that P v e b e shall declare herself, and
choose one of the young fellows for her husband. She of course selects George, but Giles extracts a promise^ Sat should any thiug prevent
ti.jir union, he (Giles; is to have the next preference. This accident instantly occurs, for die lovers, on comparison of their "infantine reeol•tions, discover that they have been bred under the same roof, though they have been divided and kept asunder by varied accidents ever
«jisce the death of their mother. Gile*- enforces his claim, which is notwithstanding rejected by Phoebe. He enters into a conspiracy, for
forcible abduction of her Person with the Squire's Gamekeeper, -whose purpose is to secure her for his master, and leave the obloquy of the
deed to Giles. The orphans resolve to have all doubts cleared, by repairing to their native village. Just a* they are about to set forth,
:. old soldier arrives, and encountering Mattie,1 a booby of strong literary ambition, though unable to write his name, learns the story
I George and Pho'be, and repairs to the Mill. Meantime Phoebe has commenced her journey, but without George. Giles is summoned
the Gamekeeper to his guilty purpose. Phcebe is rescued by the

Heroism of George & united to him.

FRIDAY, DEC. 2 8 , 1832,
On which occasion will be presented (FOR THIS NIGHT ONLY) an entirely New Domestic Drama of
interest (in Three Acts) called

EUGENE
Or, St. Robert's Cave.
W I T H N E W S C E N E R Y , D R E S S E S , &c.
The facts connected with the remarkable name of E U G E N E ARAM cannot fail to prove highly interesting to any Audience,
and are briefly these.
In the memorable year of the Scotch Rebellion, 1745, being then a Teacher at a School, and deeply engaged in the study of the Chaldaic, Hebrew, and Celtic Dialects, for the formation of a Prize Lexicon, Evgene Aram, to obtain
a trifling property, concerted with an accomplice, Richard Houseman, and, with his own hand, effected the violent Death of one
Daniel Clark, of Knaresborough, in Yorkshire. For nearly fourteen years the seciet slept with the victim, in the depths of
St. Robert1 K Cave, till the accidental digging up of a Skeleton, in the neighbourhood, led to a discovery. Aram was seized at the
O L D GRAMMAR SCHOOL of Lynn Regis; a small room at the back of the house in which he slept, was, until these la>t
few years, mysteriously pointed at by the Scholars, as they passed up to bed of a cold Ghost-enticing Night, as the Chan-ber in
which their Usher, who was hanged for Murder, used iO sleep; and the spot, just at the entrance to the Play-ground, at which
Aram was taken into custody by two strange men from Yorkshire, is still remarked, and generally by the young Scholar in «
tremulous whisper. Aram was arraigned—the gifted homicide was found guilty—and after an imperfect effort at suicid.-,
perished on the Scaffold.

CALLED

THE

COLDEN

FARMER
Or, The Last Crime.

The individual denominated the Golden Farmer, and upon an incident in whose life the present Drama ... founded,
was a celebrated Highwayman, who, under the guise of a Corn Chandler, whilst exhibiting his pockets of barley and
oats, made himself acquainted with the contents of the pockets of Farmers and Corn-Dealers by day, of which
he deprived them hy night. By his supposed honest, but really dishonest means, he amassed a considerable sum of
money in a very short time, and, under the idea that he acquired it in the way of trade, he obtained the Cognomen
of the Golden Farmer—for every speculation appeared to yield him a golden harvest. With this booty he is represented in the Drama as having purchased a farm, and endeavouring by good deeds and an honest life to make amend,
for his former errors—but the desire for wealth again tempting him to tread in the paths of guilt, he is taken, Hied,
and condemned to DEATH.

tSSSr It has bee* erroneously imagined bv those persons who have not witnessed the Performance, that this is a " Tale
twice told," ani founded on the old worn-out piece of Don Juan; it may therefore be necessary to add, that this Drama
begins where the Italian Opera finishes; and the Hero and Leporello are placed in situations entirely novel, and that
the incidents arising from these situations are completely original.

***The S E V E N V O Y A G E S of Sinbad it would be impossible to touch upon in rotation in a two hours' Drama;
the Author therefore has thus arranged it—the F I R S T Voyage is spoken of—the SECOND and T H I R D are combined, and form the F I R S T ACT—the F O U R T H , F I F T H , and S I X T H , conjoined, form the SECOND ACT, and
Sinbad promises the Audience to take the SEVENTH and Last, on the ensuing Evening ; in a tale of magic, it is of
course impossible to adhere strictly to Dramatic Rule, but the extraordinary sensation which was created L.y the production o f " S I N B A D T H E S A I L O R / ' in London, induces the Manager to hope a similar result may arise from its

Opinions of the London Press relative to Miss B a r enport:-->

" ' The Roman Father,' a tragedy by Paul Whitehead, was revived at this theatre, on Monday last The play is
almost a monodrama ; and though the story principally rests upon the conflict between the Horatii and Coriatii.
Mrs. Siddons made a tremendous effect in the character of Horatia, and Henderson, as the Roman father, electrified
our grandfathers ; but since that time this tradgedy has slumbered on the shelf, Mr. Waldron enacted the father
with great judgment, and he and Mr. Roxby were frequently and deservedly applauded. Miss Davenport's Horatia
was, of course, the feature of the play ; her tenderness, her passion, her devotion to the one object of her love, of her
life, were all given warm from the mint ol her heart. In Juliet she was charming—in Horatio, she was if possible,
more truthful; and certainly as the Roman daughter, she displayed a power of intensity that she has not previously had an opportunity of exhibiting. She carried her audience with her throughout the last act with electric force.
W e need not add that she was cheered throughout, and called for at the conclusion 6f the tragedy, which ha»
been repeated every night during the week, and is announced for repetition."—The Pott.
" Added toi youth,
you'" beauty, and accomplishments, Miss Davenport possesses Histrionic talent of the very highest
ave inot had a Juliet to surpass her, since the days of the great O'Ni.d, of whom she strongly remiuds
order. W e have
TJR."— London

Sun.

, " At nine years of age. Miss Davenport appeared in London, at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, with great success
and after visiting all the principal cities in this country, she sailed from Cork for America. She appeared in New
York, in May, 1838, and was received with enthusiastic approbation. On her first benefit there, the citizens presented her publicly with a superb gold watch and chain. She continued three years in America, visiting all the
great towns from Boston to Orleans, then set sail for the West IndieB. In Demerara, Barbadoes, and Jamaica,
almost unaided and alone, she played to the largest audiences ever known to a single performer, the receipts
averaging £300 or £400 per night. She afterwards took another rapid tour through the United States, visiting
Canada, Nova Scotia, & New Brunswick. Her parents now determined upon finishing her education; and therefore sailed for Italy, and she was placed under the first masters at Florence for eighteen months, and thereafter
twelve months in Paris ; and at little more than eighteen years of age we find her the lessee and directress of a
London Theatre,—a thing unprecedented. She appeared in London as JULIET—her success was complete. She
acted Juliet 12 consecutive nights. In consequence of ill health, she left her London establishment, & visited Germany and Holland, i n Hamburgh and Amsterdam she was greeted with enthusiasm. The King of Holland and
the whole Diplomatic Corps came in state to witness her Juliet.''—Dell's Life.

First night of the most Extraordinary Play ever written, ealleu THE

Man in the Iron Mask.'
On Monday, December IOIIR, 1840,
The Performances will commence with a celebrated PLAY, (in Four Acts) entitled

j^Kan
Or, the Prince, the Spy, and the Doomsman.
" The unfortunate Prince, itfbom I have brought up and taken care of till the close of bis life, was born September 5lh, 1638, at half-past eitfht j
his brother, the present Sovereign, gas born in the morning of the same day, about twelve o'clock. The births of these Princes present a striking
contrast: for u the elder's was splelfdid and brilliant, the younger's was melancholy and private—the former, though accomplished in mind and
manners, was unrestrained by scruples of generosity, honour, or religion, ani became one of the most detestable tyrunts thnt ever ohallenged the
exeoration of mankind—the latter, unfortuate from his birth, after years of peril, struggles, and adversity, lived but to meet a more unfortunate
end, and died «ven more obscurely than he lived ; no statue, stone, or epitaph, mnrks the spot where sleeps the Blood-Royal of France ; but iir
the old burini ground of St. Paul stands one small mound of earth, which the sun seldom visits, and vegetation blesses not,* which is still pointed
outas the last resting-place of MARCHIALI, better known as the MAN IN T I I . IRON MASK,"

De la Iteinlerit't Hittottt de V Homme an Masque de Fer, 1714.
" The Man in the Iron Mask died in the Bastile in 1704, after forty -three years'imprisonment, aged sixty-three years; after hi. death all
possible means were taken to eradicate every vestige of his existence, and to oover his memory with an Impenetrable mystery."—Voltaire.
" Died, on the 19th of November, 1703, in the Bastile, one Marohiali, was interred at Tej»'o'clock the same Night, In the Burial Ground of, Old
St. Paul."

On which occasion (and in consequence of the enthusiastic reception given to the « TOWER OF
NE..3LE and the " M A N IN THE IRON M A S K " ) he begs to announce his LAST ORIGINAL
PART in the INew Drama hereunder mentioned, which has been kept expressly for this purpose,
and can be performed on T h i s N i g h t O n l y 11
*
The performances will commence with a new and original Drama, of powerful interest, which has met with such an
unprecedented and brilliant career in London and Paris, entitled the

RAG-PICKER
OF F A R I S ,
AND THE

Press-Maker of St. Antoine!
N o t i c e . — T h e C H I F F O N I E R S , or R A G - P I C K t t R S of Paris, differ very widely from the ancient " B o n e Grubbers" of London. They are excluded from almost every society save their own, and inhabit the most remote and
least frequented quarters of the Old City of Paris—they i«sue forth at Night, armed with their implement of Labour, a
Stick, at the bottom of which is fastened an iron spike, (easily converted into a weapon of offence or defence) &a dark
lantern to turn over the refuse and soil of the City, often finding articles of the greatest value, often becoming scouts to
the most desperate bands of thieves, housebreakers, <5fc., sometimes acting as spies to the Police. It is the history and
adventures of one of these " Shades of Night" that our present Drama attempts to illustrate.

Standard thus speaks of Mr. Betty's performance ;—Mr Betty ha* studied his authors meaning deeply and tor himself.
Exeept in the more prominent parts, which general opinion h is long decided, required a particular style of acting, Mr Betty's
Hamlet stands by itself. We detect no copying.—no mauerisms.—no attempts to catch undue applanse by sacrificing the
true Teading of the text to stage eflkct, We have a thoroughly original paurtniyal; and a splendid conception it is. The grea».st proof of the genuine nature ot Mr. Betty's representation, is to be found in the marked and earnest attention Which is paid

Is engaged for S i x N i g h t s , and will appear on M o n d a y E Y n g , **5 7 t h . I l l S t . in Shakspeare's Tragedy of

OTHELLO I
Mr, SEYMOUR has also great pleasure in announcing that he has prevailed on

MR. P A L M I E R
Who in the kinle^t mi..oe; consented ,o apr ear on i hat occasion.

Several Auxiliaries are engaged who will also make their First Appearance that Evening.
Mr. SEYMOUR has the honour t o announce to the Nobility, Gentry, Officers of the Garrison and Pablic at large, that h e
has entered into an Engagement with the very eminent and Celebrated Performer

MR. EDWIN FO It It EST
for

S I X N i g h t s ; who has been so Enthusiastically Received in all the Metropolitan Thealres. and is universally
acknowledged to be the Greatest Living Tragedian of the Day.

Mr, F O R R E S T made his second a p p e a r a n d last evening in the part of Othello.
This character is identified, in the memory of the Dublin p l a y goers, with the greatest actor of his day, the late Edmund Kean, and a performer who is brought into contrast with his still fondly remembered gsuias
must have very great merit if he does not suffer friim ih.i compiruon
Mr. FOR<lE>T's Othello is a fine, boh), and original conception, and
one presenting varied points of beauty and interest. H e delineated in admirable style the gradual influence of the moral poison . 0 slowly and
stealthily instilled into his too credulous ear. Many of bis bursts of emotion were positively electric. We confess we did not expect to have been
so much gratified as we were, simply because we did not think the character so well suited to Mr, FORREST'S style and attributes as tome others «n
his list. But we hare pleasure in saying that he has not a superior la the part among living actors i and several passages were given in a style which.
we never saw surpassed. Mr. FORREST possesses intellectual and physical attributes, which fully justify him in assuming the foremost position OR
the stage. His conception . f the author's meaning is, to our mind, almost always perfectly correal, and with his splendid voice, which, like an organ
can be raised with ease to the highest pitch, and again modulated to the softest tones, he gives forth the glorious language that is scattered with
measureless profusion through the pages of Shikspeare.—From the Dublin
Freeman,

From the "Devonport
Independent1'
of Sovember 9th 1839.
This Theatre opened for the Winter Season on Monday. Though tht. opening itself mighL be considered a novelty, yet a
more than ordinrry eclat has been given to the first week, by the appearance of M r t e r ihven, who, in London, is said to

evidently no novice to the boards, and appears well acquainted with the business of the stag", knowing how to bring out his
points and making them tell on the audience; he is perfect in the text and delivers it with clearness and discrimination. His
lescription of the manner in which he h a l beei tut ored in the una of arms, hy the hermit 'who had been a soldier in his y o u t h /
was particularly good ; and the quarrel scene with Glenalvon, the scene with his mother when she reveals his birlh, and the
scene with old-Norval afterwards, were well performed. He was rapturously applauded during the evening, and called on the
stage at th? fall of the curtain
The Enteitainments will commence with HOUIKS' Tragedy of

Fourth Appearance of the Highly Celebrated

MR. GEORGE OWEN
Who w a s received Last Night with t h e most rapturous applause.
In Richard the Seco-d Shalupe-r. exhibit, to us a noble kingly nature, at first obscured by levity and the error, of an nubridled vouth.
«.d afterwards purified by misfortune, a.d rendered more highly and splendidly illustrious. When he has lost the love and reve eTe 5 h i .
.subjects, and i. on the point of los.ng also his throne; he then feels, with painful inspiration, the elevated vocation of the kingly d E v and
it« .prerogatives oyer personal merit and changeable institutions. When the earthly crown has fallen from off his head, he firft appears' a s T
king whose innate nobthtjr no humiliatio. eaa annihilate. The political history of the deposition is represented with extrwdiJS. " n o t ?

THEATRE ROYAL, DERBY.—The cr.ga-ems.it of Mr. G E O R G E O W E N the Tragedian, for a limited number of nights, has bee*
e m-an- of attracting large aud.eac23 to the theatre, and has assisted in putting something into the Manager's exchequer. Durin<r the
at wect M.\ 0«rea ha» bssn going through the principal characters of Shakspaare, On Friday we had the pleasure of seeing him i,°SAy.,ri, in " T n e M:rchint of Vuiiicr" H* is an aotnr «f t*i« highest ord;r. Hi* ihylock was a bsautiful display of histrionic art—more espe.- ,!.v in the sceua where he appears before the Duke of Venice, and asks for judgment and justice against Antonio.—Derby Mercury March

Mr. S A V K L I has, daring the past week, afforded a great treat to the inhabitants of Derby, by continuing the engagement with Mr.

Ballad- The Old Arm Chair:*

COOK.]

[Words by E L I Z A COOK.]

V-va afloat, I'm afloat, on the fierce rolling tide,
T h . ocean's my home, and my barque is my bride :
Up, up with my flag, let it wave o'er the sea —
I'm afloat, I'm afloat, and the rove, is free !"

— I love it, I love it, and who shall dare
To chide- tae for loving that old arm-chair ?
I've treasur'd it long a. a holy prige;
I've bedew'd it with tears, I've embalm'd it with lugi}.*,,
' Tis bound by a thousand bands to my heart;
Not a tie will break, not a link will start.
Would j'LiU learr. the spell? a mother sat there,
And a sacred thing is that old arm-chair.

Descriptive Cantata—* The Maniac."
[Words by M o \ K LKWIS.J
TH 1 ! following tragical event occurred iii the North of England
many yearB ago. The elder son of a wealthy family had been
residing :n India, holding a high official situation, for several
years; but, in eousequence °f several iniquitous acts he perpetrated while there, he was obliged, at length, to leave the country
add return to England. On bis arrival in his native land, he
leatnt that bis younger brother, who was unirersally beloved, was
on the eve of being wed to the only daughter of a distant relative,
celebrated for her beauty and accomplishments, and to whom he
bad frequently pressed bis suit, previous to his leaving home,
knowing, at the same time, that she was already betrothed to his
brother. Determining to glut his revengeful fcelinus tc, the utmobt
1M bad him conveyed on the very morning of the day thst the bridal
was to have taken place, to a lunatic asylum, where he was confined, notwithstanding bis heart-rending protestations of sanity,
Tht treatment tie here experisneed, added to the p ignuncy of
bis own broken spirit, at length really affected his mind, and in a
few months he died raving mad. Visions of her, happily surrounded by relatives and fiieuds, seemed constantly to float before his
qyes; and, till the hour ot his d atn, he never cosed to speak of
her he loved so dearly, and from whom he had been so cruelly
separated. Upon this incident has Monk Lewis founded his
poem of " The Mani c:"

Song-*' The Boatman of the Ohio."

As sung by the slaves in the southern states of America.

Descriptive Scena—'The Ship on Fire,"
[Words by

Esq.

'' The storafi o'er the ocean flew furious and fast,
And the waves rose in foam at the voice of the blast.
And heavily labour'd the gale-beaten ship,
'
LAke a stout-hearted swimmer, the spray at his Up ;
And dark was the sky o'er the mariners' path,
.
Except when the lightning illum'd it in wrath.
A young mother knelt in the cabin below,
j]
1
And, pressing her babe to her bosom of snow,
She pray'd to her God, midst the hurricane wild—
' O Father ! have mercy look down on'my child 1' j
Th scene is founded uon the loss pf the " Kent," East India,
man, which was totally destroyed by fire in the Bay of Bison-
