The original story of Accusation has long been naturalised in English literature. The trial of & Anglade is detailed at length, <a a volume ofleg.1 translation«, entitled “ Gallic Reports.” To those who desire only the prominent particulars, an abridged account m Vol. 9- of Charlotte Smith’s 11 Romance of Real Life," headed “ Anglade/’ wiU be interesting ; but the narrative ef Mm Opie, entitled “ Lore and Duty," which relate« every eireumstatwe, cannot be read without teare and rapture. Were the stage consecrated te conceptions like this, it would speedily reform both itself and its supporters. Whatever may be though* «* its literary pretensions, it will be confessed that the author has eminently succeeded in the leading objects of his story, in displaying the graces and dignity of oonjngal love, and hi holding up to the admiration which It deserves, that sublimt and dWnlesoatad •'«usttucy towards the unfortunate and suffering, which endears and ennobles the female character.

When an individual of superior genius and enterprise voluntarily devotes the prime of his life to the service of mankind, we naturally sympathize with him in every vicissitude; and those navigators who have contributed to the extention of commerce, ate particularly entitled to our esteem. Among these public benefactors La Pksouse ia especially worthy out approbation and attention, and the pantomitnical narrative of his adventures must consequently prove most interesting to every reeling mind.

After which, will be produced a celebrated Pantomime entitled
DON JUAN;
OR, THE LIBERTINE DESTROYED.
This singular Piece commences with Juan's Intrigues—his character is that of a daring Libertine—in disguise, he endeavours to seduce the Mistress of his Friend, Fernando, and the Commandant's Daughter, Anna; but finally causes the Destruction of both her Father and Lover. After this inhuman deed, he endeavours to Escape by Sea, but a
VIOLENT STORM ARISES,
and the Embarkation of him and bis Man, Scaramouch, is frustrated—the Ship become« a Wreck, and Juan is cast ashore, faint and almost expiring. Two Fisherwomen kindly support him to their Cottage, and offer him Refreshments—he then return« recovered, and endeavours to effect their ruin ; and on the Fisherman's entrance, a Quarrel ensues—Juan immediately ■hoots him, and hurries from the spot, in passing a Rustic Wedding he decoys the Bride during the Festivity, and carries her off. ACT II opens with a View of an EQUESTRIAN STATUE of the
MURDERED COMMANDANT,
on the Pedestal of which, at Juan’s Appearance, is seen, in Letters of Blood:—
“By th3e X fell-thy Fate’s decreed,
Heaven will avenge the bloody Deed!”
Juan, not dismayed at this, in derision invites the Statue to a Banquet, to which it suddenly assents. The Libertine is next discovered in a Tavern ; noises most hideous now arc heard—the Ghost enters and seats itself at the Table. Juan recovers him-aelf, and, with great composure, asks it to eat and drink, but is refused. He then, fearless of danger, appoints to meet him where his Remains are interred, at which place an awful scene of Expostulation ensues; but the Ghost, finding all entreaty to induce him to repent in vain, seizes and dashes him to the Earth, and the whole Scene changes to an
AWFUL VIEW OF PANDEMONIUM,
And a Terrific Shower of Fire /
Furies now gather round him—he endeavours to escape, but in vain— he is hurried away to meet the just Reward of his HtrociouB Crimes, and thus terminates one of the roost sublime Spectacles ever exhibited on any Stage.

Programme of the principal scenes and incidents of the Ballet, which is founded upon “ Number Nip," a well known German Legemd, prevalent amongst the Peasants of the Hartz Mountains, and commences with a VIEW OP THE RED RICH MOUNTAIN.
The Shepherds assemble for their morning labour, and are visited by Baron Ruthlem, his fair daughter Garlinda, & her destined husband, Count Albert. The Nobles share in the festivities of their Tenants, but the repast is interrupted by a Storm of
Thunder and Lightning, preparatory to
THE MAGICAL APPEARANCE OF THE MOUNTAIN GNOME,
and his wonderful display of gymnastic evolutions.
l'he Gnome engages in combat with Count Albert, and succeeds in carrying off his intended Bride—secluding her in the
MYSTIC RECESSES OF HIS ENCHANTED CAVERN.
Albert in vain endeavour« to discover the moans of penetrating the Residence of the mischievous Gnome, but is relieved by the Supernatural Power of Metallo, the Gnome King, who presents the Knight with an Enchanted Golden Sword, before the talis-»anie touch of which* the Mountain disappears, and discloses a Magnificent Palace and Garden of the Gnome King.— The Gnome of the Red Rich Mountain is compelled to restore the Lady, and the piece concludes with UNO DIVERTIMENTO DELI A DANZA,
In which Mr J. RIDGWAY and Miss MOGGRIDGE will perform a PAS DE

•#* The instructive and beautiful novel of Elizabeth, written by Madame Cottin, is the ground-work of "The Exile.”— Count Ulric has been unjustly banished to Siberia. Convinced of his innocence, his daughter, Alexins, lesolves, poor, friendless, and alone, to take a journey to St Petersburg, proclaim her father's wrongs, und solicit his pardon of the Krapres^Catherme.— Light-hearted and full of hope, Alexina. accompanied by a faithful servant, pursues her toilsome way, without shelter or repose, over snow-topped mountains, and through dark forests„the dread and silence of which is only broken by the baying of the wolf, or the fierce bandit's whistle. Half famished and broken down with fatigue, they rt ach Moscow, when their journey ia providentially shortened by the death of the Empress Catherine, and the arrival and coronation of the young Princess, Elizabeth. Alexins surmounts every obstacle, rushes into the presence of the new Empress, pleads her father’s cause, and finally obtains his pardon — The sequel is a couple of marriages, and consequent happiness of all parties.—Daniets Remarks on " The Exile."

In 1647, when the city of Naple. was groaning beneath the most barbarous extortions, occasioned by the tribunals of the Holy Inquisition, which Philip the Second designed to introduce there, a young Fisherman, named Tomaso Anello, of Amalphi, (but called Masanicllo), came forward as the champion of the people, to re-establish their charters and privileges ; and he evinced such enterprise and ability, that in a few days the gabel or tax was universally resisted in the public market, and the Viceroy fled by night in terror from his palace to escape an infuriated populace. Masaniello was now elected generalissimo, and hy his skill and courage so conducted the négociations with the Viceroy, that he obtained for the suffering citizens their full demands, while he was created Duke of St George, and permitted to govern in every reaped as King of Naples. No sooner had the patriot flsh-erman reached this towering height of power, than he betrayed evident marks of insanity, and at last fell the victim of treachery and ingratitude, after bsiag the avenger of public oppressions and the deliverer of his country.—History of Naples.

BRIGAND
Ai ►bbandho Maasaroni, the Italian Robin Flood, was one of those daring spirits that seem to have been created to correct the unequal distribution of good and evil. Chief of a lawless band infesting the mountains near Rome, hia name spread terror through Italy. No place was secure from his emissaries ; and so skilful were his arts of disguise, that he was often made the con-Hdant of plots laid by hi» enemies to entrap him. Like the famous freebooter of merry England, he mingled mirth with his malefactions; and those who paid dearest for his pranks, were often the first to laugh at his humour. He was full of chivalry and romance. and his mode of detention and abstraction, particularly towards the ladies, was in such good taste that they were fain to admire his gallantry, and celebrate hi* exploits in their songs.

THE NEW SCENERY BY MR. MUIR.
Among the most «trilling scene« of this very celebrat<jd romance, the following may be mentioned
t	THE SILVER LAKE,
And the arrival of the benevolent Fairy Sellroa, on her car drawn by swans.
The appearance of Ali Bab» and his son Ganem proceeding to thetr morning’s avocation in the wood*.
THE FOREST AX*D MAGIC CAVE,
f he alarm of the Woodcutter, who conceals himself in «tree—the arrival of the FORTY fHD VEH with their plunder, which Hey deposit in the ENCHANTED CAVE—their final departure—Ali Balia, possessed of their secret charm, cause« the rocks to split, and loads himaelf with the robbers'concealed treasure.
*U Baba's arrival at his cottage—displays his riches, and, by Cogia wishing to measure the gold, Cassim and his wile finally gain
_	THE MOUNTAINS OF BAGDAD.
‘be robbers' ambush—distant march—halt of the caravan from Mecca—attack of the 40 Thieves and their victory over the Araba-
^	ORCO BRAND’S CAVE.
fne Ench inter narrates to Hassarac the circumstance of the charm having been discovered by Ali Baba- He vows revenge, and jroceedB ir disguise to the city of Bagdad, where he encounters Mustapha the cobbler, who conducts him blindfolded to the Veai-vnceof Ali Baba- Hassarac is there received with hospitality as an oil merchant from Bassora, and bis jars (each containing a >bber) ar 'deposited in the court-yard of the mansion- Morgiana being in want of oil, discovers the imposition ; and by the con-'ents of a magic phial, given expressly by the Fairy of the Lake, she consigns the ruffians to death. Hassarac, discovering the nuihilaticn of his band, hurries from the spot; but soon presents himself to Ali Baba, as a friend to his departed brother, ne is •nvited to i banquet, and for soma time remains unsuspected, but at length he is observed by Morgiana, and when he is on the $oint of pi raging a poniard in the heart of Ali Baba, she fearlessly guides it to his own, and thus happily accomplishes the preservation of her master, and the
Final Destruction of the Forty Thieves.____________

BLACK ANNA’S BOWER!!!
OR, THE MANIAC OF THE DANE HILLS.
A LEGEND OF LEICESTER, IN THE OLDEN TIME.
The following drama ia founded on a historical fact which occurred in the reign of Henry the Seventh. When Richard the ITurd marched at tile head ot hia army to meet the Earl of Richmond, he slept at the Blue Boar, where he had a bedstead he had brought with him set up lo lie upon : after his death, no person ever demanded the bedstead, and it wa« considered as a fixture huianging to the house. Many persons had occupied the inn, when at length it fell into the ham's of a very worthy couple, and who room in which the bedstead stood they opp priated to their own use- The good woman being one day very busily employed •leaning the chamber, struck her broom aga nst the bedstead, and was immediately surprised by hearing money jingle on the Boor ; looking under the bed, she found several broad pieces of gold, which increased her surprise ; she called her husband, who •c.ia as much surprised as his wife, and upon searching narrowly, discovered a secret door, which being forced open, to their great toy, many other pieces tumbled out- The innkeeper grew very rich, and being considered a most respectable man, ultimately became mayor of Leicester. After his death, a conspiracy was formed by the maid servants and others to rob and murder h* wulow for her wealth, which plot was carried into effect. A hue and cry was raised, and the assassins were so hotly pursued,that they were apprehended the same overling, and brought back to Leicester town, their guilt established, and executed pursuant U Mimr sentence —Vide History of Leicester.

The above highly interesting piece is founded on a fact which occurred at Toulouse, in 1762, a subject replete with the foul* si Murder that ever was committed. In this strange affair, Religion. Kutcide, and Parricide, have been blended.— Joha Calas, fa Protestant,) was established in Toulouse as a respectable Merchant upwards of 40 years, when his Son, Antoine, fell into the'hands of designing person«, who stripped him of several large sums of money at play ; tie became also fatally attached to a young woman, whose friends forbad their Lnion, unless he abjured his Religion. These circumstances rendered him gloomy and reserved, and he became his Self Destroyer« Hit death was no sooner public than a cry was raised by the fanatics of that day. that it was a principle of Religion among Protestants that \ Father should Amaastnat his own Son when lie entertained any thoughts of being converted: monstrous as this doctrine was, it was received with on avidity indescribable.—Justice became warped, and the unfortunate Colas was sentenced to bt

of Daniel Roy*'), «ailed
JOHN
Stafford:
OR,
THE MISER AND THE ASSASSIN.
This moral and instructive drama commences with the departure of the miser's son Charles, and the marriage of his daughter Ellen to a ruined gamester, who, immediately after the ceremony, demands a suitable dowery for his bride, which Old Stafford peremptorily refuses. Enraged at the disappointment, Reynolds attempts by threats and force, to obtain a portion of the supposed wealth, but is prevented by the timely arrival of the officers of justice.— Five years are sup|x>sed to elapse, and the second act commences with the return of the unhappy bride and her husband to her native village in extreme |>overty. Reynolds and his depraved associates concert a plan to rob the miser of his wealth ■, at midnight they forcibly enter Stafford’s dwelling, who, after many ptrilous escapes, falls a prey to his avarice.
Charles Stafford, having returned from India, reaches his father’s cottage at this critical period ; and being taken by the alarmed peasantry near the body, is accused of the horrid crime. He is hurried before a magistrate, and during his examination he encounters his lost, ill-fated sister, who hears him committed to prison as a parricide ! Ellen, accompanied by Janet, resolves, if possible, to bring the culprits to justice, and for this purpose they visit the ruined abbey bv moonlight, and, after some fearful adventures, discover the assassins circled round the embers of a fire ; their discourse betrays them—a conflict ensues—and the drama terminates by the guilty receiving the just punishment of their crimes.
