The Managers regret extremelythe disappointment which the Audience must have experienced on Friday evening’, in consequence of the non-arrival of Mk. Elliston. They owe it to themselves and to the Public explicitly to state, that as they neither were in correspondence with, nor had made any engagement for that performer at the Liverpool Theatre, they strongly protested against, and totally disapproved of the announcement of his name on the occasion of Mag. Davison’s Night; the Entertainments were appropriated for her Benefit, and that Lady erroneously supposing she was entitled to his services, announced him on her own auth >rity, the whole of the responsibility attached to the unfortunate event must therefore rest entirely with her. The Managers beg to assure the Public, that they will, for the future, adopt such regulations as shall prevent the recurrence of so severe a disappointment.
