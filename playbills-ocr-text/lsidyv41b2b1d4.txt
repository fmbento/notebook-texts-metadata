February 12, 1844,	*
AND EVERY EVENING DURING THE WEEK,
WITH A VARIETY OF NEW AND ELEGANT PERFORMANCES
OF
Til FBBRCH EXHIBITION,
DU PETIT LAZ4RY AT PARIS.
The Proprietor begs respectfully to announce to the Nobility, Gentry, and Inhabitants of Edinburgh, that the •* Royal Pavilion ” having undergone considerable alterations and improvements for the comfort of the Visitors, will be Opened as above, with a Variety of Novel Entertainments of the most
Moral, Elegant, and Interesting description.
To commence with a SERIES of DIORAMIC REPRESENTATIONS of
OR THE HOLY LAND!
Animated with beautiful Moving Figures & Descriptive Illustrations*
The Subjects are by First-rate French Artists—from Drawings made on the Spot, by celebrated Travellers, consisting of Nine Animated Representations of the most interesting parts of that Country, which till nearly a century back was almost sealed to the Traveller’s eye by the intolerance of the Turks,
A journey to the east was to our ancestors as “ sadaks waters of life,” enchanting to the hope, precious to the soul, but guarded by a thousand dangers, terrors, and hardships. The songs of the wandering minstrels, full of tales of captivity and cruelty,—of the heat “ that consumed by day, and the blast by night,—long kept up this impression ! and in the castle-hall the harp’s lov’d tones were of the knights who were slain, of the watch-fires gleaming on the dreary shores,—where the armies of Israel triumphed of old, and the mighty were broken.
The pilgrim alone continued to visit the shrines and ruins of his faith, although he often gave his life for a prey ; if he returned in safety, his relics and his legends were a live-long theme. But the good times of wild adventure, of delicious suffering for the sake of the cross, are ■rone for ever ; men weep at the sepulchre of their Lord, and roam, day and night, the vales and hills of Judsa; but they shed their blood no more, and cease to tell of sad separations from all they love, and of bitter and unspeakable sacrifices. To the fields of Palestine, from the earliest pilgrimages to the present hour, the fancy has fled with joy ; over which, time and decay have had no power. In the midst of its desolations the Holy Land is still beautiful,—on many a mountain, lake and valley, there still rests a glory,—a melancholy charm, that cannot pass away. Even where the curse has fallen heaviest, and where there is nought but batrenness, there is a sublimity which the heart loves, and mem*ry can never forget;—every rock, ruin, and withered tree, is in some measure blended with the history of the salvation of mankind.

“ Victoria Templr Mound.—This place of amusement_formerly so indifferently conducted_is now under the
management of Mr Gourlay, who seems determined to afford the lovers of music a nightly resort at a price within the reach of all. Mr G. deserves credit, for what ho has already done; he has accomplished a moral reform on the Mound; for the Temple is conducted with the utmost propriety, the character of the entertainment being
unexceptionable. Let him progress towards perfection; and we have no doubt that public encouragement_
judging from the past—will be commensurate with his efforts still further to improve the public tuste."
MR GOURLAY takes this opportunity of returning his most sincere thanks for the very liberal patronage with which he has been honoured since the opening of the Victoria Temple, and respectfully begs leave to intimate, that he has entered into an engagement, for a limited period, with

Mr Gourlay respectfully requests that those who have visited his place of entertainment, and others who may be disposed to assist his «hject under the appeal, should sign the petition recommending the same to the favourable consideration of the Justices.

EXTRACT FROM WEEKLY CHRONICLE OF NOVEMBER 29, 1845.
We cannot subscribe to the doctrine that small dramatic pieces—(such as we are convinced Mr Gourlay would place upon the stage)— have a demoralising tendency. We are rather disposed to think that the licensing of the Victoria Temple would have a most salutary enét, by attracting the young from haunts over which the authorities have little control, and where thousands have been ruined. The style in which Mr Gourlay conducts his establishment is unexceptionable—the addition of dramatic pieces would only give a higher tone to the amusements.

JEATH OF THE GOLDEN FARMER AND TABLEAU BY THB CHARACTERS.
The production on Tuesday last of the New Drama, in Three Acts, entitled
DISOWNED, Or THE PRIDE OF
Having been received with great applause, will be repeated To-morrow Evening.
A due intermixture of revivals and now productions keeps up the interest of the performances at our summer theatre, and the bouses are generally tolerably well filled. On Monday, “ Macbeth" was performed for the first time this senson, Mr Glover sustaining qe part of the hero in a very powerful, yel tasteful style. No undue straining after effect was at any time discernible, and no un-varruntable prominence was given to mere “ points,” or to those traditional stage tricks sometimes so-called. The gradual sinking 't Macbeth under accumulating horrors of conscience nnd merited misfortunes—his desperate efforts to struggle against fate—his e.igerness to screen himself behind the false defences of the weird Bisters' predictions, and nis agonies when these deceitful assurances one by one fall away before him—were all very powerfully brought out. , A large audience highly applauded the performance throughout, and at the falling of the curtain loudly called for Mr Glover to receive their renewed plaudits, Last night anew drama, entitled! ‘ The Disowned, or tho I’ride of Birth," was produced, and went off very successfully. It is thoroughly French in origin and condition ; and when we say so, we need scarcely odd that the plot is neatly enough contrived, and the Incidents effective, though “ the probabilities” are more of the kind supposed to be acceptable to a French audience, than to the less artificial tastes of the English. Several of the leading members of our regular company sustain prominent parts in the piece; and in the character of the heroine. Miss Laura Addison, a young lady who has only recently come amongst us, appears to much advantage. To pleasing features and good expression, with rather a commanding figure, Miss Addison unites a powerful voice and an energetic delivery, and we are inclined vo augur well from the earnestness and feeling which she throws into all her parts.—Scotsman, July 15, 1846,
Doors Open at 7—Performances Commence at Half-past 7—Second Price at 0 o'clock,
Or as nearly as possible, to prevent any interruption to the progress of the Performance».

tr 11 E-ENGAGEMENT OF
MONSIEUR SIDINI AND MISS E. TAYLOR,
And Last Night but One of the Engagement of
»188 LAURA ADDISON
THIS PRESENT EVENING, TUESDAY, JULY 28, 1846,
Will he performed, for the First Time this Season, Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer’s celebrated Play, called The
UIY OF LYOI9.
An indistinct recollection of the very pretty little talc, called “ Perouso, or the Bellows Mender,” suggested the plot of tli» >rama. ’i he incidents are, however, greatly altered from those in Perouse, and the characters entirely re-cast. In the selection of the time in which the Play has been laid, 1 was guided, naturally and solely, by the wish to take that period in which the incident; might be rendered most probable, and in which the probationary career of the hero in the Fifth Act, upon which the denfntemet, and indeed the design, depends, might be sufficiently rapid for dramatic effect, and (on account of that very rapidity) in accordant' with the ordinary character and events of the age. The early years of the first and most brilliant successes of the French Repnbic appeared to constitute the only epoch in which these objects could be attained. It was a period when, in the general ferment of e-ciety, and the brief equalization of ranks, Claude’s high-placed love, his ardent feelings, his unsettled principles, the struggle betwen which makes the passion of this Drama his ambition and his career, were phenomena which characterized the time itself, and in which the spirit of the nation went along with the extravagance of the individuals. In sonic respectB Claude Melnotte is a typeof hat restless, brilliant, evanescent generation that sprung up from the ushes of the terrible Revolution, men born to ho agents of ho onius of Napoleon, to accomplish the most marvellous exploits, and to leave but little of permanent triumph and solid advantage t* the succeeding race.	p	»
In selecting this period as one best suited to the development of a story which seemed to me rich in materials for dramatic v lerest, I can honestly say that I endeavoured, as much as possible, to avoid every political illusion applicable to our otvn time aid ¡and, our own party prejudices and passions. How difficult a task this was, n reference to any Drama, in which the characters re supposed to live under Republican institutions, will prove. There is scarcely a single Play, the scene of which is laid in Rome, n Greece, in Switzerland, wherein political allusions and political declamations aro not carefully elaborated os the most striking ad telling parts of the performance.	*	,
T he noble tragedy of “ Ion " lias for Its very plot, its very catastrophe, almost its very moral, the abolition of royalty, and he establishment of a Republic; yet no oho would suspect Sergeant Talfourd of designing the overthrow of the British Constitution.
The principal fault of this Play, as characteristic of the time, is perhapB indeed the too cautious avoidance of all those reference to liberty and equality, in which, no doubt, every man living at that day would have hourly indulged. The old and classical sciii-nent. that virtue is nobility, (Virtua eat tola Nobilitaa,) contains the pith of all the political creed announced by Claude Melnoh ; and that sentiment is the founder, and often the motto of Aristocracy itself. It is a sentiment that never will, I trust, be considetd revolutionary in a country which boasts among its proudest names the Welleslcys and the Russels, the Stanleys and the HowardB.-Extract from the Author’s Preface.	.

An idequate description of their CONCLUDING FEAT it would be impossible to find language to convey.

INTRODUCING A NEWLY-INVENTED INSTRUMENT, NAMED
TBS liAWTBM,
On the Evenings of SATURDAY and MONDAY, October od and 5th. Their Selections each Evening will embrace
most popular of their Melodies, concluding with
THE CELEBRATED RAILROAD OVERTURE,
As performed by them for 200 Nights in London,	°
OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
Queen's Concert Rooms. — The
managers of this Institution having, at a
heavy expense, secured the services of the Ethiopian Singers, they made their first appearance last evening, and such was the excitement on the occasion, that the large Concert Room was completely tilled soon after the opening of the doors. Tbs entertainment embraced most of their popular airs in which they were most rapturously applauded, and with a few exceptions encored, and owing to the number of persons who were prevented by tire overflow, from obtaining admission, they are engaged for another ¡¿rformanee cm Friday next, boa > doubt the Room will be again crowded to excess.—Chronieje.
The Ethiopian Serenaders are marked by an originality worth all the plagiarisms put upon theLpndon Stage together, and they possess a genuine humour that must be seen to be appreciated. The song “ Lucy Neale ” was decidedly the gem of the evening, and was beautifully executed. The “ Railroad Overture,” is
of description, and the “ Old Jaw Bone”
and “ Uncle Gabriel ” were replete with the richest drollery; as the Bone player, that Gent, makes no bone of his materials at all; never were castanets so artistically handled, we trust the company will reap a good harvest, for they really merit general patronage.—Times, Feb.
An entertainment, intended to exhibit all the peculiarities of music, manners, and sentiment in negro life, was given by a party of Gentlemen, calling themselves Ethiopian Serenaders, at the Music Hall, last evening. Their glees, duets, and parodies, drew down thunders of applause ¿oat a most fashionable and crowded audience The performers have excellent intonation, and play their citrous looking instruments with much effc ct. The marked rhythm in their instrumental pieces render them highly interesting. As a ludicrous effort the “ Railroad Over, ture ” was worthy of praise. The imitations and gesticulations of the leader, who was the engine—the graduut getting up of the steam, by an accelerando which could no more, and the well-known noise
of a train setting off and arriving at a
station, render it a singular freak of musical ger.ius.—Advertiser.
The Ethiopian Serenaders still continue with unabated success at the Royal Gardens; their unique concerts, so novel, so admirably arranged, that they grow more in public favour on every representation—so admirably do they pla/ their parts, and so thoroughly have thy acquired the spirit of negro melodies, th<3U their performances are as < irions and in-1' teresting as if verb hi	-, Means, were
before us. All shoulc	f-m'a visit;

As a Dancer, his fame has long been established, and his well known Jockey Dance has never failed to draw down great applause and secure an encore. Mr M. has, however, shown that, as a Pantomimic Actor, his powers are first-rate ; and we venture to say, that his “ Dumb Box” is equal, to that of the far-famed Ducrow.”—Dundee Courier.
