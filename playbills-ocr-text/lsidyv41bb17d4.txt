celebrated TRAGEDY

of

O ROR,OTHEOROYAL
N OSLAVE.
KO:

THIS Tragedy, perhaps the most affecting in our language, is founded on the barbarous custom of trepanning and selling
our fellow-creatures for Slaves : Oroonoko, a Prince on the coast of Africa, is invited on board an English Ship to partake of an
Entertainment provided by the Captain for him ; instead of which he is seized, put into icons and conveyed to our American
Plantations; and there, contrary to every law of Humanity or Christianity, is publickly sold for a Slave: Oroonoko by a surprising turn of fate meets with his beloved wife Imoinda, who had been sold tor a slave into the same Plantation where he was purchased ; here the author has given a scope to his genius, and painted in the highest colours their unexpected and surprising
meeting, their mutual love and fond attachment to each other, with the cruelties they suH'er for her not yielding to the Cover
lior's desires; ending in the much lamented deaths of Oroonoko and Imoinda.
the following Lines are very expressive of the inhiur.an practice above-mentioned.
" Canst thou, and honour'd with a Christian Name !
' " Buy what is Woman born and feel no shame ?
" Still drive a loathsome Traffic, guage and span,
" And buy the Muscles, and the Tlonesof MAN ?—
*' A Briton kuows, or if he knows it not,
" The-Scripture plac'd within his reach, he ought,
'* That Souls have no discriminating hue,
" Alike important in their Maker's view :
" That none are free from blemish sinee the fall,
" And Love Divine has paid one price for ALL,

both in the Ups and Dozens of Life.

Replete with High Go's, Prime Chants, and Out and Outsprees.
Fouuded on Pierce Egan's well-known and highly popular Work of the same name, as performed the whole of last winter at the Adelphi Theatre, London
to overflowing houses; produced under the immediate direction of Mr. Smith, with appropriate new Scenery, the Music selected from the most eminent
composers, ancient and modern; arranged, and every air furnished with an attendant train of graces, and the overture and new music composed by G. W,
Maddison, Esq.
If as Shakspeare asserts, the proper end of the drama—is " To hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, vice herown image
and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure," the author claims for this piece a place in the very highest class of the drama—All animated picture
of every species of Life in London, deprived, through the filtering stone of the proprietor's critical c.tre, of all that might disgust or offend even the most fastidious imagination, that experience of the economy of life, and that knowledge of many of its stumbling-blocks, which have heretofore only been purchased at
the expense of many pounds, much time, and frequently no small share of peace and health, may here, in n few hours, for merely a Play-li9U.se admission, be
effectually and pleasantly acquired and secured. As in a mirror, life is, in this piece, shewn in all its varieties, virtue sees its own feature, vice its own image,
and the age and body of the tune is furnished by author, artist, and dress-maker, with its form and pressure. Tom and Jerry, it will be seen, have a moral
purpose and an aim, they are not left on the town, but conducted to their final home. Sue and Kate are proved to be very different characters from those
they have been represented; and the public will be glad to learn how their old friend Logic was extricated from the disagreeable situation in which his
original godfathers left him.

gone, lie obtains an entrance to the cave, and returns home loaded with wealth Scene 6~—
Relates his success to his rich brother, who prevails upon Ali Baba to lend him his dress,
that he may pass unnoticed—he goes to the cave, is caught by the robbers, assassinated and
thrown into the lake. Scetip 7—Mountain, desert, Black Forest, Procession, Music playing, and Zelie borne in palanquin by four slaves, attended by females, guards, &c. &c.—
they are surprised by banditti—a general combat, in which the caravan party are routed, and
Zelia bore off prisoner. Scene 8—Street— Mustapha, the colder, at work, of whom Hassarrac learns the abode of the late Cassim Baba—assumes the disguise of a merchant, and meets
with Ali Baha, of whom he obtains permission for his cargo to be lodged for the night under
the Viranda, which consists of jars, as he thinks, of oil, but contain the Forty Thieves.

each—thinks of the charm the fairy gave her master, approaches the jars cautiously, pours
t h e contents of the charmed vial into them, leaving the lamp behind—the groans heard of the
expiring robbers—Morgiana returns—a thought rushes on her mind—thinks on the false
merchant—is terrified that he should plunge the dagger in f.anuni, and his father's b r e a s t captain of the robbers enters—gives the signal, but receives no answer—thinks they sleep,
repeats it again—goes to a jar, and removes the lid, finds his band destroyed, and vows revenge. Scene last—Palace—grand
tambourine dance—Morgiana p esetils wine to the captain of t h e robbers, who observes and exclaims, the cavern goblet—Ali Baba drinks confusion
to the memory of the robbers—during this speech, the captain is holding out the goblet to
fill, but upon the mention of the robbers, turns suddenly, and drops a dagger from his sleeve,
picks it up, confused, and fancies it is not seen—Morgiana, looking at him, and exclaims, it
is the captain of the banditti—dances with a tambourine, in which she prevents Hassarrae
stahbintr Ali B a b . , without her intention being discovered—Hassarrac has at length lifted up
his dagger, and is upon the point of stabbing him, when she seizes his arm, and in the scuille
forces the dagger into the robber's breast, who falls and expires, with many other incidents
too numerous to mention—the piece happily concludes.

'* Every married couple should sec this piece, and learn a useful lesson while they laugh. It is full of
nature, whim, eccentricity, and truth."—SUNDAY TIMES.
" A new piece was brought out in the Theatre on Tuesday night, and was repeated last night with
TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE It is entitled "MARRIED LIFE," and is from the pen of Mr. Buckstone.
Its merit lies in the ludicrousness of the situations, and the humour of the dialogue. The piece was very

CLARI J
OR, THE HEART OF A FATHER.

>f any Dramas have been written, many moral discourses delivered, warning the giddy and unthinking Female against the snares of the Seducer, and trie wiles of the artful profligate. It remained
for the present Era to produce a Drama, the intense inttrest of which, can only be equalled by the
strength of the moral lesson conveyed; for while we Tremble for the danger to which the unprotected and innocent CL A RI is exposed, we weep for the deceived and broken-hearted Father, and
Snally triumph in the restored rejmtation of ihe Daughter, whom he had thought a guilty wretch
*nd who returns to her home in T R I U M P H A N T I N N O C E N C E .
It was this Drama which gave popularity to the heart-stirring and truly English song of " Home
Sweet Home," which now again in its turn reflects lustre on the parent that produced it.
It has been said that no youth should omit witnessing the representation of»' George Barnwell,*'
but far more justly might it be said, that no young Female ought to be absent from the representation of CLARI.

GRACE HUNTLEY;
OR, THE VICTIM OF VIOL

The following remarks on this Piece are extracted from the Times London Paper /—
"Among the numerous moral lessons which the stage has produced for the improvement of the
young, and the delight of the old, there are none which can produce a stronger or more lasting
effect on the mind than the Drami of Grace Huntley- The Incidents and situations, throughout
the Drama are deeply affeeting, and we sincerely congratulate the author on having produced a
piece, which by exhibiting in glaring colours the dreadful consequences of irreligion, debauchery,
and vice, may serve as a salutary warning to the rising generation of both sexes,"

King Lear is beyond all rompaiison the most affecting Tragedy that can be found in any language, a Father ia
Mind confidence, giving op all to his Children, those Children requiting liis parental kindness with scorn and ingratitude, rebelling against him, turning him out to the wild tempest, to desolation, and madness; present* a picture
so superhuman and appalling that nature shrinks Irom the contemplation of it Yet Shakespeare in the conduct of
this Drama, has displayed such wonderful art, that nothing seems overstrained, the effects howerei .hocking to
humanity, result as naturally Irom their onuses, as in the ordinary affairs of life. The madness of Lear is inevitable,
•inc. after such bitter provocation, it was impossible that reason could any louger hold her seat in a mind so formed
of passion and sensibility. And whether we consider the ungovernable violence of the unhappy King in the banish'
ment of Cordelia, and the l.itliful Kent; his credulous fondness in giving up all to his daughters, and relying upon
their duty and affection, loi the support nnd comfort of his old age; his rage and disappointment, at finding himself
deceived; his bittel imprecations on their ingratitude; his remorse for the ill treatment of her, whose only fault
was sincerity; his madness and death, with all their accompanying horrors, A more overwhelming picture of
human misery, nover harrowed up the feelings or crushed the heart.

On THURSDAY, JULY 4th. 1844,
Will be presented the celebrated Drama, translated from the French, (founded on fact)
called the

Serjeant's Wife;
THE CHATEAU ON THE HEATH.
The Searjeant's Wife is of French origin, and is founded upon events which occurred nearly
a hundred years ago, on the dreary ruv*e which lays between Nantz and Tour*. Traveller,
both on horse and foot, were so frequently misting as to cause considerable alarm, and baffled
all enquiry ; at length chance pointed suspicion, which led to the detection and punishment
of the perpetrators of deeds at which humanity shudders.
" Stones have been known to move, and 'I i,nes to speak.
" Augurs understood relations, have by Maggot Pies and Chough., and Rooks,
•• Brought forth the Secrets't Men of Blood."
SnAKsrcAR..
Lisette, is a Heroine of the first class ; her piety and presence of mind under t h . tnodt appalling circumstances, in rescuing the intended victims, render this delightfully interesting

THEATRE, HUNTINGDON.
On T U E S D A Y Evening;, August 3Oitt, 1 8 3 6 ,
Will be repeated the Celebrated Piay of

THE JEWESS;
OtM, THE EtDOOT OF OONiTAN©!.
W i t h all t h e Scenery, Dresses, & c .
BEING ITS LAST REPRESENTATION THIS SEASON.
It is in the 15th century, when the courts of Europe were filled with the chivalry of the age, in order to
support, by force of arms, the supremacy of the Church of Rome, and at the time that the Reformers under
John Hesse suffered their signal defeat by Leopold, the son of the Emperor Sigismund, the leader of the papal power, that the Author has chosen for the opening of his drama. At this period "The Jews" were the
proscribed of all nations—tolerated only to be persecuted, and allowed only partial protection for the sake
of their proverbial wealth—a wealth which the States, under which they dwelt, well new they could with
impunity seize, whenever policy, cupidity, or tyranny thought proper to immolate the unhappy possessors.
Eleazar, the Jew of the present piece, was one of those wealthy Hebrews, who, dwelling in apparent security, was supposed to favor the cause of the Reformers, at the time that the attractions of his daughter
Rachel had secured the affections of the Prince Leopold ; an attachment, the progression of which, has
often afforded a theme for the imagination of the Poet, while the results has been commemorated by the
Historian.
The above are a few af the leading Historical Facts, a knowledge of which are essential to a correct appreciation of those incidents that are now representing in every part of Enrope, and produced an interest
and excitement never before recorded in the History of the stage.

<• Conventional Decree in 1702, which supported their declarations of war by a rompulsoVy levy o r three hundred thousand men throughout
I .'.nee, was regarded as intolerable by the Vendeans, averse alike . . the R?pub'ica i « n « " >ind principles. They resisted its exaction by main
re*, delivered the conscript, in manv Instances, defeated the National Guards In others, and finding that thev incurred the vengeance of a san( .ioary Government, resolved t>y force to maintan the reiiitance which in for. e had begun. Thus original ed that celebrated war which raged
k>ng in the very^ bosom of France, and threatened the stab lily of her government, even while the hepubl c was achieving the niott oiililunt
*'ic.»ri..r .ver her foreign enemies. At first their arms (the Vendeans) were of the most simple and impf rieel kind—fbwlinu pieceB and-fusees of
every calibre they posscd from their habit, as huntsmen and fowlers ; for close encounter they h'td only scythes, axes, and such weapons as
anger places most(readily in the hands of the peasant. The Vendean took the field with the greatest simplicity of military equipment; his scrip
H i.ved as a cartridgo-box; his uniform was the country short jacket and pantaloons, which he wore at hi* ordinary labour; a cloth kna| sake cor..
tamed bread and some necessaries ; and thus he was >eady tor service. 1 n«tead of ilriinw or militarv music, they used, like the ancient ,>wisnunil
Scottish soldier, the hows of cattle forgiving -ig.-iuls to tlieir troops. Therr officers wore for di»tinctirn, a soiVofchequeied handkerchief, knot.
ted round their heads, with others of the same colour tied round their waist, by wav ofa sash, Into which they stuck their pistols. 'I his remark-.
»6le civil war broke out in the beginning of March, I7!».'., and La Cherette's execution, Bv which it w«.» closed, took place at Nnnt« Sflth March
•.796. The murders committed at Lvona, though hundre is were swept away by voh.es of musket-shot, fell short of the horrors perpetrated b "
*arrier,at Nantz, who, in avenging the Republic on the <.bstinate,resistatice of La Vendee, might have summoned hell to match his cruel,v,
thout a demon venturing to answer his challenge. Hundred-, men, wdmen, and children, were forced on bnaid of vessels, which «'»«* ?cut.'. *d and «wuk in >he Loire, aifd this was called Republican Baptism. These punishments were also called Noyad.es.

IGAND

Alessandro Mdssaroni, the Italian Robin Hood, was one of those daring spirits that seen} to have been
< reated to correct the unequal distribution of good and evil, chief of a lawless band infesting the mountains
Lear Rome, his name spread terror throughout Italy. No place was secure from his emissaries ; and so
skilful were his arts of disguise that he was often .made the confidant of plots laid by his enemies to entrap
him. He was a strict dispenser of moral justice: if he made free with the rich, he was the almoner of the
poor ; and never did he resort to violence, but when a tempting booty'and stout resistance stood in his way.
Like the famous freebooter of merry England, he mingled mirth"with his malefactions, and those who
>aid dearest for his pranks, were often the'first to laugh at hi3 humour. He was a very-gentlemany
•rigand, full of chivalry and romance : and his mode of detention and abstraction, particularly towards
the ladies, was in such good taste, that they were fain to admire his gaJantry, and celebrate his exploits in
their songs. A mystery hangs over his birth.
His mother was a Florentine, who, having been seduced
and deserted by some •« puppy upknown," had died of a broken heart and the only family record he
possesed, was her miaiatpre, which, even in the wildest moments of disorder, and rapine, produced in him
certain compunctious visitings of nature, that showed he was deserving of abetter fate. Such was
Macaroni, nurtured by banditti—once their cbitarade—now their chief.

AND THE OFFICERS

Of the First Royals, Fort-Greorge.

Mr. J. DALY,
'.Prom tke Theatre. Royal Covetit Garden, Ilaymarket, Dublin,'EdinburglvaudGlasgofw, most respectfully informs
the Nobility, Gentry, and Inhabitants of Inverness and its vicinity, that his

BENEFIT

*

and moat positively his LAST A P P E A R A N C E this season,'is fixed for

Friday Evening, August 28,1840,

Under 'the above distinguished Patronage.

The performances will commence with the celeb rated National Drama, written by SAMUEL LOVER, Esq, Author of
Rory O'More, entitled the

WH
This interesting Drama, the production of S. LOVER, Esq. is perhaps, the most happy effort of that highly-gifted gentleman, whose talents as a Novelist, Painter, Composer, and Farce writer, is so greatly admired. The action of the Drama
commences at that period of history after the abdication of King James, and the accession to the throne of England by
William of Orange. The commissioners of forfeiture having assigned the estate of GERALD PEPPER, an Irish Gentleman,
and no Absentee, to Major Hans Mansfeldt, a Dutch follower of King William, for his adherence to the cause of the unfortunate James, the Dutchman, with a troop of soldier*, arrive at the seat of Gerald Pepper, whose courage and interest with the peasantry had saved the lives of the party from their fury, l'epper learns that the individual whose life he
had preserved is no less than the new Inheritor of his property ; he determines by stratagem to disgust the Dutchman with
his new estate; calls a meeting of his tenantry, by whom he is greatly beloved ; he informs them his inheritance is about
to pass into the hands of a stranger, and requests their aid to his plan—one universal cheer is the answer; a series of the
most mirth-moving incidents take place. Gerald himself, disguised as a ragged boy on the estate, undertakes to guide
the Dutch Soldier to the family mansion of tihe Peppers, informing him of the various relations of Mr Pepper—BLACK
PRPPKH, WHITE PEPPER, RED -PEPPER, GROCS'D PEPPER, WHOLE PEPPER, and GINGER. The horror struck Dutchman is
conducted over bush, brake, and bog ; his horse sinks into a ddep ravine and is lost; he is informed the country is on«
wild forest and bog. The old Ruined Castle is fixed on for the Dutchman's introduction to Ballygarth House, while Aggy,
he maid, per.on*tea.u» Old Hag, the supposed housekeeper; a miserable supper is terved up, no part of which the stranger
is permitted to taste. Shots are fired off, and shouts heard ; the Dutchman is told 'tis merely the pastime of the inhabitants who have K I L L E D A N E W LANDLORD. This information terrifies him ; he determine, to return to England,
but how to get out of the dreadful neighbourhood—his horse is lost—and to procure another he consents to sign a deed
renouncing all claim to the estate of Ballygarth. Gerald again appears as Himself, and the Dutchman, fearful of remaining longer in .uch a dangerous vicinity, D E P A R T S , leaving the Pepper Family in possession of their property.

The Fatal Prediction

t

" When the last Lord of Ravenswotfd to Kavenswood shall ride.
And woo a dead Maiden to be hi§ bride ;
In the hall of his fathers his blood it shall flow,
And his name be lost for evermo'e."
All who have read the original from which the present Drama is adapted, must remember the thrilling
sensations experienced on its perusal. The high-sonl'd honour of '

EDGAR

RAVENSWOOD,

who,'bent on avenging an Insult offered to Iris father's corpse, is turned from his purpose in a irfdmerft
by the appearance of his enemy in distress, and rescues him from the most deadly peril at the imminent risk of h i . own life. The heart-breaking struggle between duty and affection in the bosom of

\

LUCY ASHTON*

which terminates in her death, and bar dying expression is one of the most pathetic'and sweetly eitpif^tsive ever penn'd in this or any otlier language, 'Ravenswood, they have broken tny heart, but never,
never could they change my love. The obstinate perseverance of that old and faithful retainer ofthe
family of liavenswood,

CALEB BALDERSTONE,
who is determined to support the ' Credit o' the house,' if he 'should e'en beg, borrow, lie and steal 'to
the end of the chapter;' all these combined render it a Drama of the most soul-absorbing interest,

The Music, composed and arranged for the Orchestra, by Mr. T. Cooke, Director of Music at the
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.
The Hero of this Piece was a «ort of Italian Robin Hood, Chief of a Lawless Hand, infesting the Mountains near Rome, No place
was secure from his emissaries, and so skilful were his disguises, that he was frequently made the confident of plots laid by his enemies
to entrap him. Such an air of gallantry and chivalry accompanied his depredations, that they were frequently the theme of laudatory
rhymes, and those who paid the dearest for his pranks, were often the first to laugh at his humour.

Has t h e honour to Inform the Nobility, Gentry, Inabitants and

Wednesday Next. January 1 3 , 1 8 3 6 ,
W h e n will be produced a Grand Romantic Drama from the following Legend—entitled the

PRINCE S TOWER:
Or, D E H A M B I E and the F I E R Y D R A G O N .

£c livre noir dt Cmtaneu, Is perhaps not altogether divested of truth. The account we have is,
that this part of the island was infested by a monstrous serpent or dragon, the ravages of which d«tol.ted the country. Fired with an ardent desire
to destroy the dreadful hydra, a Norman Hercules,
named De Hambie, or Ds Hambye, undertook the
adventurous enterprise and was successful ; but in
the terrible conflict, this heroic nobleman, was apparently suffocated by the pestilential breath of the
iijing monster. De Humble was attended in this
eipea.tiuu t>> a supposed trusty domestic, who
perceiving his master begin to revive, murdered
him. Returning to Normandy, with the tragical
account, that hi, lord did not long survive the encounter, he presented to the disconsolate widow a
litter, which he said Was written by De Hambie
j"ast before hi, death, and which contained an
earnest request that his lady Would recompense

the faithful sen-nut by the gift of her band, T/h.
artifice prevailed, and the "mourning bride" trai
united, at the sacred alter, to the murderer of her
deceased husband ; but on the very day in which
this vile miscreant was thus congratulating himself on the success of his villainy, he was auddenly
seized with a delirious paroxysm, disclosedthe
horrid truth, and on recovering, was tried on bis
own confession, and publicly executed.
De Hamble's widow, as well to testify her grateful thenksgmng to Heaven for this miraculous deliverance, as to establish a lasting memorial of COR.
jugal affection towards her murdered lord, caused
a large and high mount of enrth to be raised on the
Spot where De Hainbie was buried ; on the summit
of which mount she built a chapel, with so iofty a
tower as to be visible from her own mansion at

The Story on which this Drama is founded possesses peculiar claims on the sympathy and approbation of the Public. The Count
St. Angeville being left guardian to the young and interesting Amy Cassonnette, involves her fortune by a career of dissipation and
extravagance, the hand of his Son Victor is destined for Amy, but her affection having been given for Count Rosenford, St. Angeville,
to avoid disgrace,

Resolves ou the Murder of the Innocent Amy,
TO EFFECT WHICH HE EMPLOYS THE SAVAGE OF THE FOREST.

But providentially Amy and Violette having changed bed-ch«mber,|, the Dagger of the Assassin is directed to the bosom of Angeville'!
" tughter Violette, instead of the proposed victim ; St. Angeville, overwhelmed with remorse, is on the point of discovering himself to
the Magistrates, in pursuit of the Forest Savage, who has effected his escape with his supposed victim, Violette.
VICTOR, TO SAVE HIS FATHER FROM PUBLIC EXECUTION,

AVOWS
HIMSELF THE CRIMINAL,
*'lnd lather and Son are confined in a Chamber of the Cattle.
But are released by the aid of a faithful Servant, Von France ; the Forest Savage, bearing Violette, takes refuge amid the Rocks of
La Charboniere. Count Rosenford seeks shelter in the same Cave,

A Combat between Rosenford and the Forest Savage,
i% followed by the discovery that Violette's life has been preserveJ, the Count is cleared of all suspicion, and an excel moral is incul' -Ated, that ot bending in human resignation to the power whose protecting arm is always extended to reward the innocent, and visit
with punishment the guilty.

Will be performed by the GENTLEMEN AMATEURS, the Nautical Drapa of—THE

Inchcape

Bell.

This melodrame.or, in the modern phrase, Nautical Drama, is founded on atale of terror—The Bell Rock, or " Inch-cape Rtfck "
M it is more commonly designated by mariners, is a sunken rock offthe north-east coast of Scotland, and was, formerly very dangerous to saHors, The obb«t» of AWtyothock, ««• AWtiro».iwi..k, a reir|fiou. 'foundation, sianding near the coast, caused a large bell
to be erected on the float near the rock, so as to ring by (he agitation of the sea, and by this simple means to indicate to the bewildered
seaman the perilous situation in which he was placed. Tiere is a tradition current among the inhabitants of the coast, that the bell was
cut from the float, and stolen, and that the person who awnmitted this nefarious act, afterwards met his fate by shipwreck on this very
rock, during a dark and .tormy night. On this tradititn Mr. Ball has founded his piece, which is judiciously chosen for dramatic
interest and effect

First

and Only Appearance

this Season of Mr.

AGAR.

On Wednesday, August 2 , 1 8 4 3 ,
Will be produced Shake»peare's splendid Tragedy of—

KING LEAR!
AND H I S T H R E E D A U G H T E R S .

King Lear is, beyond comparison, the musi afltcttng Tragedy that is to be found in any Language. A father, in blind
confidence, giving up .11 to his children—those children rrquiiing his parental kindness with scorn and ingratitude, rebelling against him, turning him out to the wild Tempest, to desolation and madness, present a picture almost superhuman—
yet Skakespeare, in the conduct of this Drama, has displayed such wonderful Art, that nothing seems overstrained ; th.
effects remit as naturally (from their cause*) as in the ordinary affairs of life. The most affecting image in all antiquity ii
Priam supplicating Achilles for the dead body of Hector. But Lear, wandering over th« barren heath, amidst storm and
tempest, with a broken he.rt, and a bewildered brain, is so transcendently sublime and awful, that antiquity must acknowk d g e the SUPREMACY o.f SHAKESPEARE and

THE NEW SCENERY BY MR. R. CORRL
John Peerybingle, (the Carrier)
Mr. G. J-MV1 HSON.
' That lumbering, slow, honest John, that John so heavy, but so light at spirit ; to rough upon the surface, but so gentle at
coie ; so dull without, so quick within ; so stolid, but so good."
Tackleton, (the Toy Maker)
Mr. SH ALDERS.
" H e didn't look much like a Biidegroom as he stood in tin Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face and a screw
in his boJy, and his hst jerked over the budge of his nose, ami hi* hands stutk down into the bottoms of the pockets, an.)
hi, whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self peering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrate! essenee ol any
namber of ravens."
Caleb Plummer, (his Mao)
Mr. FIELDING.
" A little, meapre, thoughtful, diity faced man, v. ho seemed to have made himself a great coat from the sai k ch t'l
tdverin- of some old b. x ; for when he turned to shut the door, he disclosed upon the back of that gaimtnt the in.cript-0 >
0 ami T in large black capitals.
The Stranger
Mr. GLA OSTONE.
" His grab waa very quaint a, d oi'd—a long, long way behind the time. He had long white hair ; good features .>ingi.larly bold aod well defined for an old man; and dark, bright, penetrating eyes."
Mrs. Peerybingle, (familiarly known as Dot)
Mrs. H. FRAZEP,
" Fair sh« waa, and young—though something of what is caded the dumpling shape ; but I don't myself obj.ct lo that.''
Bertha, (Caleb Plt.mmer's bbnd child)
Miss JOSEPH1N F,
" She and h t r father lived all alone by themselves, a. the Story Books say—and my blesfci, g : with yours to back it I
hope : on the Story Books, for saying anyihing in this workaday world."
M.y Fielding
Miss LEWIS.
" Tackleton wa« a man of taste beyond all question. Muy was very pretty."
Mrs. Fielding, (her Mother)
Mrs. SH A LDERS.
" An old lady with a peevish face, who was very gente.1 and patronizing. The m..jistic old soul had adorned herself
with a cap calculated to inspire die thoughtless with sentiment, ofawd."
Miss Slowboy, (a Foundling)
,
Mr. DOUGHTY.
" The maternal ;md paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity a Foundlinsr,
which word though differing (rom Foundling by one vowel's length, is very different in meaning, and expiesses oilier things."

T k n unprecedented success of this valuable Production at the Theatre-Royal,

me, and death attend the guilty instruments of her mifery. Throughout the whole play it feems
to have been the author's defign to inculcate this excellent moral, That notwithstanding Providence
y for a while fuffcr the innocent to be opprefled, it neverthelefs, in its own good time, (hatches
n from the arm of violence, and turns their tears to fmiles, their anguilh to delight.

THEATRE,
KENDAL.
(Licensed according to Act of Parliament.J

On Tuesday Evening?, J u l y 2Oth, 183O,
To commence with the celebrated Parisian Drama, (as acted in London and the Principal
Provincial Theatres with the greatest success) called

3 0 YEARS O F A

Gambler's Life:
Or The l i n t of the R e d Mountain!
This Piece, which has been nightly represented to crowded audiences at the Theatre, Port St. Martin, in
Paris, has excited a stronger sensation in that Capital than any other produced there for many years. The
frightful extent to which the rage for Gambling has spread in that City, and the fatal results to which it too
often leads, have apparently induced the highly talented Author to direct the utmost force of his pen against
that destructive vice; and never perhaps have its consequences been pourtrayed in so strong a light, or the
wretchedness, guilt, and despair which arise from it, been so vividly illustrated as in this Drams.
It professes to represent the L I F E OF A GAMESTER, but as it is impossible to present on the Stage in a continued series the transactions of so long a period, the occurrences of Four and Twenty Hours at different
periods of his life, separated by intervals of Fifteen Years, constitute each act or part of the Drama, which.
it is confidently anticipated, will be found one of the most powerfully interesting and impressive ever transferred from the French to the Englinh Stage.

gripe ofthe villain Dirk Hatteraick and restoring him to his lawful possessions, divert the attention of the
audience—the Gipsy's prophecy is verified as follows:—

To conclude with the New Popular Nautical Drama of The

Floating
Beacon,
Or, Vhe'mVovMriegian WreeHers*

This Drama, which for interest and situation is not surpassed by any on the British Stage, is founded on
an occurrence which took place on the Coast of Norway about Ten years ago. The Sand Banks and Shoal»
on that Const require to be pointed out to the devoted Mariner, and humanity prompted a plan whereby
many a gallant life might be saved and commerce encouraged—The Norwegian Government stationed on the
Coast the hulks of vessels of war which were no longer fit for service, these Bepcons, which were manned by
Criminals who were doomed to Banishment for life, were thus made to benefit Society at large and do penance to the offended laws of their country, each night warned Vessels from the local danger. Three desperate criminals, not content with having harassed their fellow men on land, instead of lighting the Beacon
yrben required, made the deluded seamen their prey, in permitting them to steer on these Shoals and ferociously sacrificing- them.

"NEW T H E A T R E , KESWICK.

By their Majesties Servants.
T h e Public are respectfully informed, that the Entertainments for this Evening are selected as in .London, with^.
View of affording Amusement, blended with Instruction and Example, for the Good of the Y O U N G E R P A R I
of the Audience * and it is the Manager's Wish, to spread the Benefit of so good a Lesson.

On SATURDAY Evening, July 6, 1805,
Will be performed, the celebrated T R A G E D Y of

G. Barnwell,
OR

THE

London Merchant.
" Re warn'd ye youths, who see my sad despair,
" Avoid lewd women, false as they are fair."
LILLO.
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so very beneficial to the vising generation, and
is one of the Plays lately revived al Dfury-Lane.—The Manager thinks he cannot better discharge his duly to the
Public of KESWICK, than by performing it also in this place.
SHAKESPEARE says
" That guilty creatures sitting at a play,
" Have, by the very cunning of the scene,
" Been struck so to the soul, that presently
" They have proclaim'd their malefactions."
HAMLET.
*
A story is recorded, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a young Gentleman of London,
having embezzled part of his Master's property, providentially at a representation of George Barnwell, at DruryLane, when that admirable Actor, Mr. Ross, performed the Character of Barnwell, he _ was so struck with
remorse as to effect his instantaneous reformation.—His encomiums on the Play, and especially in_ the masterly
manner in which Mr. Ross delineated the character of Barnwell, had the most happy effect on this gentleman:
and consequently at every yearly benefit of Mr. Ross, he sent him One Hundred Pounds sterling, with a card to
the following effect:
Dear Sir,
" One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, for more than life, for his redeemed
honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the inclosed, which you will receive yearly, so long as you continue in
the line of your profession. Happy am I to acknowledge that the stage has preserved me from ruin and disgrace,
George Barnwell stopt me in my mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death.
I am your grateful friend and servant,
A CONVERT."
Where instruction can be blended with amusement, every good parent will be anxious—every master will be
desirous—and every teacher will recommend this valuable play to the attention of their pupils, As it exhorts the
youth of both sexes to the practice of virtue, which even the most inveterate enemies of the Theatre must allow j
surely then it cannot give offence, although heads of families and others, are fhus solicited to permit the young
under their protection, to nee this moral, i i u t i u U i r c , and awful T i a ^ c d y of G e o r g e Barnwell.

" Learn to do well from others ill,
7Vnd you shall do full well."
Li n o .
This play, it may be depended upon, was founded on fact; the unfortunate hero of the Tragedy, George
Barnwell, was executed for the murder of bis,virtuous and venerable uncle ; to which he was instigated by an artful
cruel, and abandoned woman, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; step by step she led the unwary youth, to the last
cruel deed which terminated a miserable existence by the most ignominious death.

NEW THEATRE, KESWICK.
T H E Manager, anxious to gratify the KESWICK Audience with every Novelty that his Abilities can compass,
or even London produce, is happy that he is at length enabled to present them with a Comedy which has sc
universally excited the Attention of the Public, and the Merits of which have been unequivocally confirmed
by a Run of Success in the Metropolis, unequalled by any former Piece, GAY'S Beggar's Opera, and SHERIDAN'S School for Scandal, not even excepted.
Theprincipal Aimof Mr. C H E R R Y in the SOLDIER's D A U G H T E R , is unitedly to cherish the Respecl
for Commerce by which Great Britain has reached such envied and unrivalled Splendour, with the martial
Ardour so necessary at this moment to protect those Riches from a foreign Spoiler, and her Liberties from
the Tyrant of Holland, Italy, and Switzerland.
" Ye Sons of Commerce, grant your pow'rful Aid,
" And give your Voices in Support of Trade.--—
" A Mass of Subjects in a loyal Band,
" To drive the Spoiler from their native Land,
" And future Tyrants teach that Host to fear,
" Which boasts the Name of B R I T I S H V O L U N T E E R . " _
,
N o r has he failed to rouse our beautiful Countrywomen in the glorious enthusiastic Cause——and his Heroine
animates them in Terms of equal Fire with patriotic Rolla—
•• While Glory animates each MANLY Nerve,
" Should British W O M E N from the Contest swerve ?
«
No
" We'll form an ARMY
of RESERVE.
" So shall th' Artillery of British Charms,
" Repel Invaders without force of Arms."
The Soldier's Daughter, inflated with such ardent Sentiments of Loyalty, an unexceptionable Plot, original in
Character, and moral in Design, mwt long prove a desirable Treat to a British Audience——and every Individual must own Mr. C H E R R Y has brought
" From Nature's School, with virtuous Precepts taught her,

J

" A YEOMAN'S W I D O W , and a SOLDIER'S D A U G H T E R . "

T H I S is one of Mr. COLEMAN'S happiest Productions. It is a genuine Comedy; in
which (he comic is blended with the serious, and Mirth is enjoyed the more because it is
mixed with Distress, The loose Manners of fashionable Life are exposed with Success,
and the Audience are captivated by plain English Virtue. The Interest is well kept up
throughout the whole Piece, The Language is, in general, elegant and correct; the
Moral unexceptionable, and the Sentiments noble, bold, and impressive. Many of the
Situations are inltresting, and produce considerable Stage Effect; in short, a better Play
has never been witnessed. The Characters, the Story, the Interest of the Piece come

NEW THEATRE, KESWICK,

By their Majesties Servants.
On MONDAY Evening, July 29, 1805,
Will be performed, the much-admired PLAY, call'd the

Point oS Honour.
From a German Original, adapieito the French Stage by Mercier, and
to the English Stage, by Mr, Kemble.
The following Sketch of the Story will clearly evince how interestino1,
and truly affecting, are the Incidents of this admirable Story.
DURIMEL, a soldier in the service of France, h; ving been provoked to strike an officer, deserts his regiment to avoid the punishment which awaits so glaring an infringmertt
of the laws of military subordination. He is fortunate enough to procure some mercantile
employment in the house of a widow lady, on the borders of Switzerland ; and nn attachment io her daughter Bertha, who retum.hu passion, is, in a"short time the consequence.
1 he manly integrity of the young soldier, induces him to discover to the mother the"predicament under which he lies: the particulars of this discourse being overheard bv a disappointed rival, he communicates the circumstance to the officers of a French regiment,
at that time quailered in the village j the uninformed lover is, in consequence, appre-hended as a deserter. The interest of the drama now commences, Vurfinel has not seeu
his father for many years, and the latter, in consequence of his gallant and meritorious
services, had risen from an inferior situation in the army, to be a major in this very regiment. He was one of the council who examined the youth, felt himself bound to join in
pronouncing the sentence of death upon him, and is appointed to give the fetal sigii.,1 ai
the moment of execution. The complicated distress of a parent thus situated mtust be
obvious to every feeling mind, the meeting of the father and son, in which the coonition
of their mutual affinity takes place, is a scene of highly wrought tenderness
The remainder of the play is chiefly occupied in depicting the struggles between a sense of duty and
parental affection, which agitates the breast of the major; and the distress of Duiimcf,
every moment expecting to be summoned by Guards, agonized by the distraction of his
beloved Bertha, and overcome by the deep affliction of his father. The bursts of grief
and passion naturally flowing from the perplexities, are intermingled with occasional
sentiment of consolation, fortitude, philosophy, and religion. The Point of Honour \i
maintained by Durimcl, in refusing to escape when it is in his power, and in resisting the
major's entreaty to avail himself of the favourable opportunity. He would rather die than
disgrace his fathers character. They proceed to the fatal spot! The handkerchief is bound
round the head of the interred victim to martial law, and the muskets are levelled at the
object. The father endeavours to give the signal, but his resolution wavers, and lie sinks
under the ov^-rwelming agony of his sensations. A thought suddenly occurs to him : He
gives the word of command, and instantly rushes before the body of his son ! Every one
is thrown into the utmost consternation, the relationship of the parties is discovered and
the deserter receives a full p»rdon for Lis offences.

NEW THEATRE, KESWICK."

By their Majesties Servants.
On SATURDAY August 17, 1805,
Will be performed, the favourite Tragi-Comic PLA V, call'd the

Merchant oS Venice,
JEW AND TmTcHRISTIAN,
Written by the IMMORTAL

SHAKESPEARE.

When LEARNING'S Triumph o'er her barbarous Foe?,
First rear'd the STAGE, immortal SHAKESPEARE rose ;
Each Change of many-colour'd Life he drew.
Exhauster! Worlds, and then imagined N e w :
Existence saw him spurn her bounded^ Reign,
And panting Time toil'd after him in vain:
His pow'rful Strokes presiding Truth confess'd,
And unresisted Passion storm'd the Breast.
Dr. S. JOHNSON.
T H E S T O R 7 OF T H E T H R E E CASKETS O F

GOLD,

,;

SILVER, and L E A D ,

Introduced in this inimitable Phy, is taken from an old Translation of GESTA ROMANORUM.—Three Vessels
are exhibited to a Lady for her Choice.—The first was made of pure Gold, well beset with precious Stones, without
and within full of dead Men's Bones.
POSIE—
" Whoso chooseth me, shall find that he deservelh."
The second Vessel was made of fine Silver, filled with Earth and W o i m s . ' — - P O S I E . —
" Whoso chooseth me, shall find that his Nature desireth."
The third Vessel was of Lead, full of precious Stones.——POSIE.—
" Whoso chooseth me, shall find God hath disposed for him.'
The Lady, after a Comment upon each—chooses the leaden Vessel.
FARMER.
The other Part of the Fable of this Play, which relates to the Forfeiture of

A POUND OF FLESH,
May be found in the PECORONE of SER G I O V A N N I F I O R E N T I N O :
The Stile of thb Play is even and easy—with few Peculiarities of Diction, or Anomalies of Construction—
the Comic Part raises Laughter, and the serious fixes Expectation.—The Union of two Actions in one Event is, in
this Drama, eminently happy.

GAMBLING!!
To hold this detested vice up to public view (the fatal consequences
.f which have so recently shocked every feeling mind, and spread terror
jhivuEii our native kingdom), has caused the Managers of the Theatre.
Royal, Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden, to. introduce the admirable
Tragedy of the GAMESTER—a Play Avhicn ranks pre-eminent for ito
moral tendency; the Manager cdhCeives he cannot better discharge h »
4uty to the Public than by reviving it in the
KIDDERMINSTER THEATRE J
He therefore has the honour to announce that on SATURDAY, D E C
80, 1828, will be presented Moore'ij highly estimated Tragedy of
TO*.

Gamester;
T H E FALSl?. F R I E N D ,

*

Revised by J. F. Kemblc, Esq.
It is well known how greatly the example of the hero in the popular
Play of GEORGE BARNWELL has operated on the minduof youth of both
sexes—how greatly beneficial it has proved for many years; and from
whence the inference may reasonably be drawn, that where the horrid
practice of Gaininir is painted in its true colours, and held up to detestation, the lesson it will convey to theminds of every spectator is a MORAL
of the most essential tendency.
Follies, if unconiraul'tt, of every kind,
Grow into passions, and subdue the mind;
Willi sense and reason hold superior strife,
And conquer honour, nature, fame, and life.

In the recent Murder, there is something so oppalling to the mind, so degrading to human
feeling, that it will form a black and frightful page in the annals of crime ;—the situation antj
manner in which it was perpetrated, the connexions of the parties, their progress in iniquity,
and the plans of enormity which they bad laid, their hardened levity while their hands were
yet red in the blond of their victim ; render ,hif Sate of more deep and general interest than has
called upon tfye public atteution for many years; yet it involves a lesson of wisdom and of caution,

EVENING, OCTOBER 14th, 1839,

W i l l be performed (second time) Liilo's celebrated Domestic Tragedy of

Gr JTA O RGrlloi

BABNYVELL 9
OR, THE

aasfias! MSJiiEiLSif^a

THls affecting Tragedy (the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising1 generation) is founded on fart. The unfortunate hero
the Piece was, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, to which he was instigated by an
artful, cruel, and abandoned woman. Step by step she led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence by a mo'
ignominious death.
A story is reported, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a young gentleman of the City of London, having embezzled
part of his master's property, was providentially (at the representation of George Barnwell, at Drury-Iaue, when the admirable actor Mr, Moss personated George Barnwell), so struck with the fate of Barnwell, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The gentleman so
benefited by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to own his obligation to ll>e Play and the Performer, for at every subsequent yearly benefit Mr. Moss
•yceived a Hundred Pounds sterling, with a card to the following effect:—
" Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell for more than life—for his redeemed Honour and
credit—begs your acceptance of the enclosed, which sum you will receive yearly as long as you continue in your profession. Happy am I to
acknowledge that the stage has preserved me from ruin and disgrace. George Barnwell stopped me in my mad career, and saved me from an
ignominious death.—I am, &c.
i
" A CONVERT."
A celebrated Divine observes, that " fathers and beads of families, whose duty it is to watch over and guide the morals of the rising generation,
Wjuld do well to permit young people under their direction to be present at the performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which instruction is blended
with amusement.A

ARC!
OR, THE

•Maid of Orleans.
This Play, one of the most successful of modern times (having been performed 100 successive
nights in London), is founded on historical facts. During the reign of Charles VII. of France
the English invaded that country, with every prospect of making a complete conquest; when
Joan of Arc, a domestic servant at a small Public-house, fancied herself inspired : she was placed
at the head of the French Army, raised the Seige, and entered Orleans in triumph ; subsequently
she waB taken prisoner, in a sally, at the Seige of Compeigne ; and at once, to destroy the magic
influence of her name, she was burnt as a Witch, A.D. 1431, in the 19th year of her age.

This Drama is almost literally extract.d from Sir E. L. BuLWEa's powerful Novel. The remarkable name of " EUGENE A R A M , "
belonging to a man of unusual talents, is unhappily associated with a deed of blood, as extraordinary in its details a. any recorded in our calendar of
crime.
In the year 1775, being then an Usher, and deeply engaged in the study of various languages for the formation of a Lexicon, he abruptly turned
oyer a still darker page in human knowledge; and the brow that learning might have made illustrious, was ignominious for ever with the brand of
tn, To obtain a trifling property, he concerted with an accomplice, and with his own hand effected the violent death of one DANIEL C L A R K E ,
« Knaresborough, in Yorkshire. For fourteen years the secret slept with the victim in the earth of St. Robert's Cave. The accidental digging up of
"skeleton, ami the unwary and emphatic declaration of ARAM's accomplice, HOUSEMAN, that it could not be that of CLARKE, betraying a guilty
Knowledge of the true bones, he was brought to a confession of the place of their deposit. The learned homicide wa. seized and arraigned ; and,
j'ter a trial of uncommon interest (in which Houseman was admitted King's evidence), and a most ingenious defence on the part of ARAM, he was
lound guilty, and suffered accordingly.
Two sudden blows with ragged stick.
One that had never done him wrong,
And one with a heavy stone.
A feeble man and old :
He led him to a lonely field.
One hurried gash with a hasty knife,
The moon shone clear and cold ;
And then the deed was done !
Now here, said he, this man shall die,
There was nothing lying at his feet.
And I will have his gold.
But lifeless flesh and bone !!!

The story on which this Drama is founded, possesses peculiar claims on the sympathy and approbation of the
Public. The Count St. Angeville, being left guardian to the young and interesting Amy Cassonetto, involves
her fortune by a career of dissipation and extravagance ; the hand of his Son Victor is destined for Amy.
but her affections having been given to the Count Rosenford, St. Angeville, to avoid disgrace,

by remorse, is on the point of discovering himself to the Magistrates, in pursuit of the Forest Savage, who

But are released by the aid of a faithful Servant, Von Franc; the Forest Savage, bearing the insensible Violette,
takes refuge amidst the Rocks of La Charbonier ; Count Rosenford seeks shelter in the same Cave.

A Combat between Rosenford and the Forest Savage,
Is followed by the discovery that Yiolette's life has been preserved ; the Count is cleared of all suspicion, and
an excellent moral is inculcated, that of bending in human resignation to the Power, whose protecting arm
is always extended to reward the innocent, and visit with punishment the GUILTY.

JOAN OF ARC!

This Play, one of the most successful of modern times (having been performed 100 successive
nights in London), is founded on historical facts. During the reign of Charles VII. of France,
the English invaded that country, with every prospect of making a complete conquest, when
Joan of Arc, a domestic servant at a small Public-house, fancied herself inspired : she was placed
at the head of the French Army, raised the Seige, and entered Orleans in triumph; subsequently,
•he was taken prisoner, in a sally, at the Seige of Compeigne ; and at once, lo destroy the magic
influence of her name, she was burnt as a Witch, A D . 1431, in the 19th year of her aire.

ON

THURSDAY

Kidderminster.
EVENING,

Nov. 5, 1829,

Will b e performed the new and popular Drama (never acted here), called

THE

Labourer;
OR,

T H E LOST SON.
This Piece deviates widely from the usual range of Melo-Dramas : it possesses no romantic adventures,—no improbable or highly wrought traits of heroism : it is a simple tale of real
life. Luke the Labourer has many prototypes. Idleness and dissolute company cause him to
be dismissed from the employment of Farmer Wakefield, and involve him in misfortunes: he
vows revenge; and from his schemes to injure the Farmer and his Family arise the incidents
of the Play. But this scene of domestic distress is happily enlivened by the absurdities of
Bobby Trot, whose repeated disappointments on his way to London convulse the audience
with laughter, and chase away those emblems of sorrow,-which the serious incidents of the Play
have drawn forth. But the smile is on the lip, and the tear in the eye, when Philip appears ; his
rough benevolence, and honest affection for his Parents and his Sister, awaken at once our
sensibility and laughter. As the tale draws near its conclusion, the interest becomes intense.
The whole attention is riveted to the stage ; and the escape of Philip from the machinations
of Luke, and his restoration to the arms of his Parents, never fail to elicit bursts of
applause.

Wakefield (a decayed Farmer\ Mr. HOPE. Charles Maydewtfa young Farmer), Mr. HAYES.

T H E BOLD SMUGGLER,
OR, THE

BLACK jpRA.YTo.liI
This interesting Piece may fairly be ranked among the first of modern Melo-Dramas ; for Tragedy and Comedy
are so happily blended in its scenes, that the adin'rers of Puthos and the lovers of Mirth, iitttbt alike be gratified, ami
alike anxious for the developement of the Plot
The navel, but striking manner, in which Levi LYONS produces his
witness of the .Smuggler's innocence, is alone sufficient to stamp the merits of the Drama, «nd it is ever reccited with
tumultuous applause. Perhaps it were too mnch to say W n i WATCH is of superior worth, but certainly it is not
inftrior to the celebrated Drama of BLACK-EYED SUSAN*.

TERRIFIC STORM!

The Sen is seen raging iu Mountain billows, and a NOBLE VESSEL FOUNDERS AMIDST ITS FURY.
LEVI LYONS enters affrighted, and describes his

MEETING WITH THE BLACK PHANTOM!!!
ROB RUDDERLY urges WILL WATCH to MURDER MARY, his supposed Daughter—WILL repels him with
honest indignation, but is prevailed on to lend his Pistol, which ROB afterwards produces as proof that WILL
WATCH is the MURDERER of YOUNG E D W A R D ! Levi Lyons purchases the Cargo, and the Smuggler,
disguised as Jews, assist him in evadinir the REVENUE OFFICERS.

A rude Garden, and a River flowing rapidly in the distance.
Mary and Edwaid enter—Rob Rudderly fires at the Boy, and throws him into the stream, and then attempts the life
of Mary, who is saved by the interposition of WILL WATCH—Arlington and the Soldiers appear, when ROB
RUDDERLY accuses WILL and MARY of EDWARD's MURDER.

A ROMANTIC PASS AND WATERFALL.

The Mysterious Appearance of the Black Phantom,
AND HIS MEETING WITH THE STRANGER.
PROCESSION to the H A L L of JUSTICE—the JUDGE and COURT assembled for the TRIAL of WILL and
MARY—The affecting parting of WILL and his sweetheart SUSAN—their fate seems irrevocable, and Sentence is
being pronounced, but

THE BLACK PHANTOM INTERPOSES,
And Levi Lyons produces an Evidence,

Who points out Rob Rudderly as the Assassin!!!

.AJS'GTON.

Mr. SANDERS, in announcing the above Drama, never produced by any other Manager, and
Which has been written Por the express purposoof embodying in a Dramatic form, those Historical and
legendary Traditions with which Herefordshire so richly abounds—begs leavo to premise, that from
one of the most ancient, and certainly one of the most illustrious families of olden times, the MORTIMERS, Earls of March, the Hero of the Drama is solected-—The period likewise in which this branch
of the Mortimers lived, was so peculiar connected with the civil contest of those distracted times, in
which he himself was «.o leading an Historical feature, that independently of local interest, a strong
national feeling must be excited by the illustration of events, which have become prominently facts of
the Chronicler and Historian.
The contentions of the proud Barons with their unfortunate sovereign Edward II,—his Imprisonment
in Berkeley Castle—the desertion of all his friends, even the Queen Isabella, his wife—the ignorance in
which his son, the renowned Edward III. was kept concerning his father's fate,—the awful and appalling catastrophe of the King's assassination by Berkeley, Gournay, and Montravcrs—present, to the s o
lection of the Dramatist, an accumalation of incidents of a most varied and powerful interesting character. And when in addition to whijh it is mentioned that all these events have connection with this
immediate neighbourhood, and the main-spring of such important political movements: the Earl of
Mortimer, resided at the well-known CAS TLE of WIGMORE. it will be unnecessary to enforce the
intense interest which the Representation of a production so entirely relating to the Vicinity of Kington,
must naturally excite in those Spectators, whoso minds are stored with the Historic and Legendary re*
collections of former times, and who may for the first time witness Ihem, deliniated with all the powerful adjuncts of Dramatic illusion.

On WEDNESDAY EVENING, JULY 27,1836,
Will be presented, an original Drama, founded on the Traditions of Herefordshire, and produced
with New Scenery, Machinery, Dresses, &c entitled

On FRIDAY EVENING. JULY 29, 1836,
Will be presented the Historical Trag edy of

Barnwell
" Be wuru'il ye Youths yon see my sad flpspair,
" Avoid lewd women, filse as they arc fair."

This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation, is
one of the plays lately revived in London. The Manager cannot better discharge his duty to the
Inhabitants of Kington, than by reviveing it in this Town.—Shakspeafe says=*" That guilty creatures sitting at a play,
" Have by the very cunnihg of the scene,
" Been so struck to the soul, that presently
" They have proclaimed their Malefactions."

This Play it may be depended upon, was founded on fact; the unfortunate hero of the Tragedy GEORGE
BARNWELL, Was executed for the murder of his virtuous Uncle; to whom he was instigated by an
urtful, cruel, and abandoned women, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; step by step she led the unwary
youth to the cruel deed which terminates a miserable existence by the most ignominious death.

A C O M I C SONG b y M a s t e r C A L H A E M .
Mr. SANDERS, in announcing the above Drama, never produced by any other Manager, and
which has been Written for the express purpose of embodying in a Dramatic form, those Historical and
legendary Traditions with which Herefordshire so richly abounds—begs leavo to premise, that from
one of the most ancient, and certainly one of the most illustrious families of olden times, the MORTIMERS, Earls of March, the Hero of the Drama is selected—'The period likewise in which this branch
of the Mortimers lived, was so peculiar connected with the civil contest of those distracted times, in
which he himself was so leading an Historical feature, that independently of local interest, a strong
national feeling must be excited by the illustration of events, which have become prominently facts of
the Chronicler and Historian.
The contentions of the proud Barons with their unfortunate sovereign Edward'II,—his Imprisonment
in Berkeley Castle—the desertion of all his friends, oven the Queen Isabella, his wife—the ignorance in
which his son, the renowned Edward III. was kept concerning his father's fate,—the awful and appalling catastrophe of the King's assassination by Berkeley, Gournay, and Montravers—present, to the selection of the Dramatist, an accumalation of incidents of a most varied and powerful interesting character. And when in addition to which it is mentioned that all these events have connection with this
immediate neighbourhood, and the main-spring of such important political movements: the Earl of
Mortimer, resided at the well-known CASTLE of WIGMORE. it will be unnecessary to enforce the
intense interest which the Representation of a production so entirely relating to the Vicinity of Kington,
must naturally excite in those Spectators, whose minds are stored with the Historic and Legendary recollections of former times, and who may for the first time witness them, deliniated with all the power,
ful adjuncts of Dramatic illusion.
Will be presented, an original Drama, founded on the Traditions of Herefordshire, and produced
with New Scenery, Machinery, Dresses, &c entitled
