with Poverty and" Distress) become disabled from exerting their
professional Duties. I t is founded on the Model of similar Instit utions in both the London Theatres, to which R O Y A L T Y itself is
annually so munificent; being supported by the Weekly Contributions of Subscribers, Members of the Circuit, aided by the kind
assistance of Benefactors, a List of whom it is hoped it may not on
