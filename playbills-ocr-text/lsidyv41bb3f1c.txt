Theatre Royal, BIRMINGHAM,
the celebrated Drama of

JACK

HEPPARD!
The Housebreaker or 1703,

TO T H E P U B L I C — I n the production of this most p»traordinary Drama, some apology, »r explanation may be deemed
necessary. In the literary Gazette of this day i, an article Which completely meets the question :—First, It is rwicessary ttut
every publication should he framed *'oi the express !>..rpnse ,,f'pr,ii,i,!U. „ ,„or«l? S«.c..Wljr, Does JackSheppurd succeed or fail
in Urn object? And Thirdly, Do such subject* offer fair materials to exercise the talent of authers,and afford public gratirkatio»
•without lrv)ury to the public mind ? To the fii.t enquiry we think we are bouud to concede, that, much as we value moral inert-.
cation, to aohere to it as a sine qua nan would be to exclude a multitude of playful, imaginative, and innocent productions,
which have ever been the enjoyment of cultivated .ocieiy. To the second the reply would be, that, so long as human nature is
human nature, and there is guilt as well as virtue, it may be as expedient to explore the lower and darker recesses of viltiimy,
a* to develope the stinted crimes oft ragedy in high places. Nay, as the former immediately affect and come in contact with the
vast majority of our fellow creatures, it is more expedient to p u t the ignorant many on their guard against the seduction of
common vice and (he invasions of bold brutality. The main point, therefore, comes, after all, to be the treatment of the them*..
Are we made to feel a deeper concern for the scoundrel and murderer than for th* wrorged and good—is criminality made prosperous, and honesty (alas ! too often suffering in the real world) held up to disregard and odium' But we find none of'these
offences in Jack Sheppard; Fielding has chosen "Jonathan Wild " a s his "great mas,'* to barb the keenest ahafts of irony against
crime, so do we think Mr. Aln.wotth has in an entirely different and more popular manner, elected bis ruffian victim, Jath
Sheppard, to demonstrate lhat there is no mortal nulta vertute redemptum; that depravity, however covered by bravado, i« a.re
to entail compunction and punishment; and that, unequal as are the fates of the bad and the good, the preponderance of milter.
ing rests with the former, and the balance of even earthly comfort with the latter class. Our author has curiously, though in*idently, supported this view, by supposing that Hogarth took the hint of his vigorous and impressive lesson of Industry and
Idleness (in the two apprentices) from seeing Jack Slieppard previous to his execution, when his portrait was painted by Sir
James Thornhiil: may not w» also guess that something of Mr. Ainswortb's story' might have been suggested by Hogarth**,
pictures? See Cruikshanka inimitable procession of Sheppard to Tyburn; the buffoonery, the riot, the orgies, the triumph of
Sin, the incitement to rapine and bloodshed ; and compare them with the sad and solemn administration of the law^ l i e change
effected within a century; and say whether the upholding of the past to censure Is not calculated to expedite the fort her improve •
ment of the future I In fine, Jack Sheppird is
To all an example,
T o no one a pattern,
, t aud an ignominious death is the just reward of a».atroeioiM life. The fondbes of remorse atad repentance it has pleased Mr.
Arnsworth to invest his closing career, are worthy of much eonfmendjition, hot only as finishing the humanity of his coueeptiw.
but as doing homage to the invincible principles of cftnscienee and retribution.

Will be acted the much admired TRAGEDY, called,

ML Mhm\l\^ JL ,
Earl of

Northumberland.

THE Scene of this Tragedy lies at-Raby Castle, the Seat of the present Earl of Darlington.
The Story is founded on the consequence of the fatal Cheviot-Chase; where many hundreds of gallant
Noblemen were slain in a Family Quarrel between EARL PERCY and DOUGLAS: Percy is betrothed^o Ehviua, the daughter of lord Raby; but while,he is at War, she is forced into a marriage
with earl Douglas. Percy returns a conqueror, and claims his beloved Elwina. Earl Douglas, jealous
of Percy, accuses his wife of Infidelity. Percy and Douglas fight: Percy is slain, and Douglas takes a
scarf given by Elwina as a token of love to Percy, presents it to El wina, who faints at the sight. Elwina
dies distracted; thus ends the most elegant and interesting Tragedy ever produced on the British Stag,©.
To drive the deer with hound and horn,
EARL PERCY took his way,

THEATRE, ORMSKIRK.
On Thursday Evening, Aug. \ §ih, I 8 I 2,
WW1 be acted the celebrated Military Play, called the

Point of Honour;
OR, THE

NOBLE DESERTER.

..u *
.u.. ft
' • Kembht j£sq,
Wm-fiWtmmg €#.*• wm dtarty erimv, fete mtrnking and t0eethg are the kwkltnts of this
admirable Play,
BUR1MKL, ...soldier in the service of France, having been probked to strike an Officer, deserts
kil regiment to avoid th* punishment that awaits so glaring an infringement of the law* of miliiai v
subordination.--He is fortunate enough to procure some mercantile employment in the house of a
widow Lady, on the borders of Switzerland; and an attachment to her daughter Bertha, who returns
Jus passion, is in a short time the consequence. Theruanly integrity of the young soldier induces him
to discover the predicament under which he lies : the particulars of this discourse being overheard by
a disappointed
rival, he communicates the circumstance to the Officers of a French regiment, at that
* r ' i ^ U a r t e f e d i n t h e v i U | l & e ; ' n e unfortunate lover is apprehended as a deserter. The interest of
the Drams* now comincnces, Durimel has not see. his father for many years, and the latter in conseMience of his gallant and meritorious services has risen from an inferior station in the army to be
Rtyorof this very regiment. He was one of the council who examined the youth, felt himself bound
.©join in pronouncing the sentence of death upon him, and is appointed to give the fatal signal at the
Mctnent of execution. The complicated distress of a parent thus situated, must be obvious to every
feeling mind , the meeting of a father and son, in which the cognition of their mutual affinity takes
place is a scene of highly wrought tenderness. The remainder of the J'Jav is occupied i» depicting
the straggle* between a *.*mse of duty and paternal affection of bis father. * The bnr»ts of grief am*
passion naturallyflowingfrom these perplexities, are intermingled with occasional sentiments of consolation, fortitude,philosophy, and religion. The POINT OF HONOUR is maintainedby Darimel
in refusing to escape when it is in his power, and in resisting the Major's entreaty to avait himself of
the favourable opportunity. He would rather die than disgrace bis father's character. They proceed
to the fatal spot. Th* handkerchief is bound round the head of the intended victim to inakiallatr,
and muskets are levelled at the object. The father endeavours to give the signal, but his resolution
wavers, and he sinks under the overwhelming agony of bis sensations. A thought suddenly occurs to
him, he gives the word of command, aud instantly "rushes before the body of"hi« son: every one is
thrown into the utmost consternation, the relation of the parties is discovered, and the deserter receive*
a full pardon for his offences.

CYMBELINE,
KING OF BRITAIN; OR, THE INJURED PRINCESS,

This Tragedy is founded on a Period of Ttme, soon after the ROMANS became Masters of P r ' - V n .
SHAKESPKAKS has followed the History io those ea»ly Ages pretty close. There is through the wh le Pl.v,
a deal of Bustle, Plot, and Incident, similar to the Time from whence it is taken, The noble Defence made
by pQ.riioMus, B E L L A R I U S , G O I B I R I U S , and A R V I G A R U S , in a grand Fight between the Romans ar>d

Britons, who by their single Valour, turned the Fortune of Battle, and put the Romans to flight coiWincti g
us our Ancestors were possessed of Courage, (if not of Discipline) equal to those Masters of the Wo,1,1. as
they were then stiled, CVMBEI. IKE'S Discovery of his lost Sons, who had beers stolen from him. and b.ed up
under the Tuition of Old B E L I A R I U S , gives a pleasing turn to the Piece, and POSTHUMUS finding IMOGEW
living and innocent, not only winds up the Plot agreeably to the Rules of Criticism, but must both affect
and please a judicious Audience.

THEATREr~OSWESTRY.
On WEDNESDAY EVENING, OCT. 15th, 1823,
Will be produced, an entirely new Classic, Comic, Operatic, Didactic, Moralictic, Aristophantic, Localic, Analytic, Terpsictioric, Panoramic, Camera-Obscura-ic, Extravaganza Burletta of

Fun, Frolic, Fashion, and Flash,
Being entiiely different from the one performed by the Amateur Actors ; and intended
to convey, through the medium of Stage effect, the PORTRAITURE of LIFE, delineating in TWENTY-TWO SCENES, a variety of Incidents, Accidents, Occurrences, and Acquaintances, likely or liable to intrude themselves upon the notice of a
STRANGER in LONDON. The whole to portray, or rather to animate some of the
most interesting Chapters in PIERCE EGAN'S highly popular Work, after which this
Piece is called, viz.

TOMoOJ
OR L I F E IN LONDON.
Produced under the Superinteudance of several of the most celebrated Artists both in

THE UPS AND DOWNS OF LIFE,
Who have all kindly come forward to assist the Manager in his endeavours to render this Piece a complete OUT AND
OUTER, replete with

Prime Chaunts, Rum Glees, and Kiddy Catches.
The MUSIC selected and modified from the most eminent Composers, ancient and
modern, arranged, and every Air furnished with an attendant Train of Graces.
The SCENERY,
painted from Drawings taken on the Spot, by Mr* HENRY.
PnoHEKiuM,—If as Sbakspeare asserts, the proper end of the Drama is—"To hold as 'twere the
mirror up to Nature, to shew Virtue her own feature, Vice her own image, and the very age and body of
the Time ite form and pressure,"—the Author claims for this Piece a place in the very highest class of
the Drama,—An animated picture of every species of Life in London, deprived, through the filtering stone
of the Proprietor's critical care, of all (hat might disgust or offend even the most fastidious imagination ;
that experience of the Economy of Life, and rfiat knowledge of many of ite stumbling blocks, which have
hitherto only been purchased at the expence of many pounds, much time,* and freqaently no small Share
of peace and health, may here, in a few hours, for merely a Playhouse Admission, be effectually and pleasantly acquired and secured. As in a mirror, Life is, in this Piece shewn in all its varieties—Virtue sees
Ms own feature, Vict; ite own image, and the age and body of the Time isfartiiihed by Author, Artat, and
Dross-maker, with ite form and pressure.

OK, THE FALSE

FRIEND.

>

Written by.the Rev. Dr. MOORE. In the progress of thia admirable Play, the finest feelings of the human
breast are alternately roused to the highest pitch of tenderness, and the very acme of distress! The language is
energetic ami sublime! 'I he circumstance described are those of an amiable family plunged into the most agonizing affliction, by the destructive practise of Gaming. T o curb this vice and guard against its evils, become*
the duty of the Moralist and the Public Lecturer, tho' none can so effcciually picture its enormities, as those
" W h o hold the mirror up to nature, who shew vica its own image, and the very age and body of the time its
form and pressure.
Hence may the Gamester learn, ere yet too late.
To shun iliat Vne which endless ills await;
Wild as the Sea his maddening passions flow,
Himself, Wife, Children, beggarded at a throw.

O ! should a Father or a Husband come.
Wham Dice have lured from happiness and home,
To listen to our tale,—our hope is here,
'i'o check one Gamester in his mad career.

On MONDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 1st, 1830,
Will bo Performed, (not acted here for many years) Shakspeare's celebrated Historical Plsj, called

CYMRELINE,
King of Britain ; or, the Injured Princess.

This Tragedy is founded on a Period of Time, soon after the Romans became Masters of Britain. Shak.pears
has followed the History in those early ages pretty close, There is through the whole Play a deal of Bustle,
Plot, and Incident, similar to the time from whence it is taken. The noble Defence made by POSTHUMU.,
BKLLARIUS, GUIDKRIUS, and ARVIGARUS, in a grand fight between the Romaus and Britons, who, by their
single Valour, turned the Fortune of Battle and put the Romans to flight, convincing us that our Ancestors were
possessed of Courage, (if not Discipline) equal to those Masters of the World, as they were then styled. Cymbeline's discovery of his lost Sons, who had been stolen from him, and bred up tinder the Tuition of old
BELLARIUS, giving a pleasing turn to the Piece ; and PO.TIIUMUS finding IMOGEN living and innocent, not only
winds up the Plot agreeably to the Rules of Criticism, but must both affect and please a judicious Audience.
