'The Management, zealous in evert/ thing that can contribute to public accommodation, has availed itself of the short Easter recess in warming and ventilating the Interior ;—in lighting the House by a new and splendid LUSTRE ; and in beautifying- and decorating- the Saloon,
The STOVES which have been constructed, upon a new principle-, exclude the cold and raw Air, and introduce into the body of the House a mild and refreshing temperature ; while the active and powerful Ventilator draws off the damps, and renders salubrious the Auditory part of the Theatre,
The new brilliant LUSTRE, lighted by Gas, is an improvement upon every thing that has hitherto appeared,—it sheds a clear, soft, and beaming Light over the House, neither obstructing the sight, or diminishing the interest oj the Stage.
The Saloon has undergone a thorough and complete change, and will be opened as usual, for the accommodation of the Half-price Company.

These Considerations have induced the Gentlemen of the Sub-Committee most ■kindly to offer Mr. Carr the use of >the Theatre for this Evening; and his Theatrical Brethren, amongst whom Mr. ELL1STON has ranked himself have ;with the most unanimous and zedlous Promptitude volunteered the aid of their talents gratuitously on this Occasion, to which the Patronage of the Publiek is most respectfully and earnestly solicited.

How truly it was said from the first of the success attending the Tragedy of BRUTUS, and Mr. KEAN's masterly delineation of that noble Character, every' person will readily subscribe to, who has witnessed the transports of joy aud rapture with which it is nightly received, and though so often repeated, namely Twenty-three times, it still increases in its attractions, as the Box Book will testify, there not being a Box untakrn tor more than a week to come.—So successful a Play has not been brought forward since Sheridan’s Pizzarr». and Bruhis is likely to rival that celebrated work in its number of acting nights, it will.f course be continued to be performed «eery Evening tillfurther notice.
