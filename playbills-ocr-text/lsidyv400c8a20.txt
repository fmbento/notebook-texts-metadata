I was waiting with Mr. K e m b l e in expectation of the pleasure of meeting you here a s
appointed a t our interview yesterday, when your letter of this morning was delivered to me. M r .
Kembte requests m e to say that h e is most anxious to consult your convenience, b u t t h e nights of
Monday, Wednesday a n d Friday in next week, which you s u g g e s t for your performances, are
advertised for R O M E O and JULTET, and I need not say to you that o u r duty to t h e Public renders a n y
aiteration now impossible. A s you observe that you can plav on no other nights b u t those you h a v e
been accustomed to in both the London T h e a t r e s , I can only assure y o u that every endeavour shall
be made t o comply with y d u r wishes. Before ; however, we say more on this point, Mr. K e m b l e
desires that I should remind y o u , in allusion t o t h e intimation which you made to m e yesterday of
vour intention to enter into a n e n g a g e m e n t in London for this season, that there is an e n g a g e m e n t
subsisting between you a n d Covent Garden which precludes your acting in London during t h e
present season, a n d h e thinks it j u s t t o all parties that this shoulil not escape attention. I t will
afford Mr. Keinble m u c h satisfaction to accommodate circumstances to your present views, a n d
difficult as it will b e at this advanced period of t h e Season to make such alterations in t h e a r r a n g e ments of t h e Theatre, (which arrangements have been made on the faith of your a g r e e m e n t ) as will
enable him to do so, h e is ready to encounter such difficulty on your account, and with this feeling h e
was prepared to make you an offer of an e n g a g e m e n t for this season, had you been able t o meet him.
A s you are unwell to day, if you will favor us with an appointment for tomorrow, Mr. Kemble will
be happy to talk t h e matter over'with you.
You will be kind e n o u g h to receive this communication expressly on the understanding that it is
made without prejudice t o your present agreement with Covent Garden T h e a t r e .
I am, &c.

I have j u s t learned that you were last night served with the Injunction, restraining you from
t h e intended violation of your e n g a g e m e n t with Covent Garden T h e a t r e — I have not seen M r . C .
K e m b i e since, but I am so fully in possession of his sentiments, that, t h o u g h the duties of his situation
rendered it imperative on him, in consequence of your total disregard of t h e two letters I addressed
*o y o u on t h e 24th a n d 26th instant, to a p p e a l to t h e law, I a m satisfied h e is still ready, a s
expressed in my letter to you of the 24th, ( a n d t o which I earnestly solicit y o u r attention) t o e n counter, on your aceount, t h e difficulty I therein pointed out to you, in order to meet your wishes for
t h e present season ; a n d I a m very confident, t h e same arrangement m a y t a k e place if you choose
to avail yourself of it, as would have been made known to y o u , had you t h o u g h t proper to t a k e
any notice of either of those letters.
I shall take a n early opportunity this day of seeing Mr. Kerable, and unless you h e a r from me in
the course of t h e m o r n i n g to t h e contrary, y o u may consider that h e does not withdraw from t h e
proposal which it was his intention to have made t o y o u .
But-1 think it fair to apprise you, that knowing M r . Kemble* s sense of obligation t o the Public,
I a m induced to think h e will c o n c u r with m e , in t h e necessity of publishing my communications to
