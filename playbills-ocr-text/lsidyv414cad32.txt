UPWARDS OF SIXTY FEMALE WARRIORS!!

•t^'SSf 3 History tells us Tales of Female Heroism of such marvellous character, that had we not, from time to tiuie reiterated proof, tee might
.S=3§f
look on those Meteors of their Age—the " J O A N S OF ARC and FLANDERS,"—and the equally wonderful " J E A N N E OF
BEAUVAIS," as the mere offspring of imagination, fostered and immortalized by Superstition a..d Tradition; but from period to period in succeeding times, from amid the Fire of War and the Horrors of Carnage, impelled by I,ove, and by Filial Vengeance, have arisen instances of
Female Courage and Devotion—which, in the inid.t of Flames, and even ut the Cannon's mouth, have rescned Cities, and preserved the nobly
Brave from what seemed certain annihilation. Witness " THE MATRON OF MISSOLONGHT," and " T H E MAID OF SARRAGOSSA."
The GREAT NAPOLEON, who well knew the power of example, and the pride of memory, hastened to do justice to the immortal deed of the
" HEROINE OF THE HATCHET;" he erected a Statu, to her Fame in the Town she had defended, and ordained that for ever, on the Anniversary of the Dav made illustrious by her deed, in everv Game, Festival, or Procession, " THE WOMEN OF BEAUVAIS SHOULD HOLD
PRECEDENCE OF THE MEN."

Highwayman, who, under the guise of a roni-chamller dwelling in Thame. .Street, whilst exhibiting his packets of
barley and oats by day, madr himself acquainted with the contents of the fanners' pockets, of which he despoiled then,
by night. By these dtshunest mean, he acquired a considerable sum, purchased a farm, obtained the title of the Gulden
farmer, and endeavoured by sincere repentance and a reformed life to make some atonement for his former misdeeds,
but avarice tempting him into his old courses, he is taken, tried, and condemned to death.]

THEATRE-ROYAL,

BATH.

M r . H A T , in announcing himself as SOLE LESSEE of this Theatre, begs most respectfully to assure the
Nubility, Gentry, and Inhabitants of Bath and its vicinity, it will be his earnest endeavour to render this elegant
Establishment in every way worthy their support.
The COMPANY has been selected with great care, is numerous, and comprises some of the FIRST ARTISTES
in the Provinces. Every NOVELTY will be produced with strict attention to propriety in the appointments. FIRSTRATE METROPOLITAN STARS are Engaged ; and neither pains nor expense spared in the arrangements.
Mr. HAY trusts he shall be excused suggesting to that most respectable and very influential class of Inhabitants—
the Tradesmen of Bath, that it must be to their interest, as it is to his, that the Theatre of a City, honoured as Bath is
by Visitors and Residents of the highest rank in society, should be, at least, inferior to none in the Provinces, He will
not speak of the large sums of money thrown nightly into circulation anion,- them, during a successful Theatrical Season. Now this superiority can only be kept up by liberally supporting the Drama; as without such aid, whatever may
be the talent or energy of the Manager, from his vast expense, it must soon become unworthy of support when it ceases
to obtain it; and, although it is to be regretted that many estimable and conscientious persons are, from mistaken
prejudice, opposed to that art which has, more than any other, tended to the civilization of mankind—fancying evils
in a Theatre which (whatever may have been in the oklen time) fortunately now exist only in their imaginations; still
there is a large, talented, and wealthy portion of society, who, following the example of the FIRST LADY IN THE
LAND, give their support eveu now to that instructive amusement which their Fathers loved and encouraged. Surely,
in this City, that class, equally with others, has claims for consideration.
The Manager trusts that, in his most arduous undertaking—in his endeavour to make the Theatre what it once was,
he shall be honoured with that patronage which it will be his highest ambition to deserve, and without which nothing
can succeed.

Season Tickets to be had of Mr. Brownell.
The following Ladies and Uentlemen are engaged, and will have the honour of appearing during the Season, vi-.:

T R A I N E D S T E E D , F A I R Y P O N I E S , &c. &c.

S io universally admired on their former visits 10 years since, and now introduced for positively FOUR NIGHTS ONLY,
0 n their return to London, and the Last Time the Public of Bath will have of witnessing this unrivalled Establishmeat,
b teing on their final Provincial Tour. Regardless of expense, Mr. HAY has formed an arrangement with the above
i .rtistes to give a Last Series in this City of DUCROW's productions—Equestrian and Dramatic Spectacles, with those
< iorgeous London Appointments and Accessaries, and produced on the same scale of splendour as at the Theatre-Royal
1 )rury Lane, Astley's, &c. &c—In order to give full effect to this splendid Equestrian Spectacle, New Scenery has been
j >ainted by Mr. HAWTHORN ; and the Stage will be entirely thrown open, shewing the Bull Ring as at Madrid.

To prevent .ny misconception on the part of the Visitors to the Theatre, and at the same time add to the surprising nature of the Performances
Ladies and others are informed that the Bull is personated by one of Mr. DUCROW'. broke Horses, tutored for the purpose, enveloped in an Elastic
Skin, and so managed as to deceive even the nicest eye; some apprehension having been originally expressed by those who bad not witnessed this
Exhibition, that the Bull was a real one, this announcement is made to obviate any mistake of the kind: this interesting and highly Romantic and
Chivalrous Pageant may be witnessed by the Spectator with the utmost delight.

THE BATH COMPANY OF COMEDIANS,
N
Members of the Orchestra, Treasurer, Artist,
Wardrobe-Keepers, and Servants of the Establishment.
Tb. Committee have t b . honor most respectfully of informing- the Nobility, Gentry, the Trade, Friends of the Drama, and tbe
Public generally, of Bath and its vicinities, that, in consequence of the Season having- terminated so unfortunately as to render it
utterly impossible for tbe Manager to satisfy all the arrears of salaries due, it is respectfully announced that the T r u s t e e , o f
t h e T h e a t r e have, in the most handsome and generous manner, gratuitously tendered tbe use of th. Theatre. The Committee, therefore, are induced to announce

T W O PERFORMANCES,
Th« produce of which will be appropriated (so far as the amount will go) in liquidation of Mich arrears. They, on behalf of the
Establishment generally, beg further to state, that many Members being without engagements, and others, having them, wanting means to proceed on their journies, tbe only alternative left is by this humble appeal to a generous Bath Public, in which
they confldently rely, on extensive patronage and support, as the means of extricating the Company from its present embarrassment.—Situated, as Theatrical Companies generally are, in a town where they are comparatively strangers to .very inhabitant,
their bread—their very existence, is always dependent upon the receipt of their salaries ; failing in this, where can tbe Actor
loos for sympathy and support, but to that Public for whose amusement and gratification he had devoted his talents and his life ?
Tb. Committee beg to announce that thev will be aided in their endeavours by the talent of M e s s r s . N E W C O M B E ,

B E D F O R D , C H A S . P E R K I N S , H E R R I N G , and several Professional F r i e n d s ; and on th,.

UifS" Nationality becomes a virtue when it springs from feelings inspired by the land of our birth. " T h e man that don't like
England," exclaims honest Jack Fuller, " let him leave it."
Blessings on the memory of (he Bard, '* and palms eternal flourish
round his urn," who first struck his Lyre to celebrate the Wooden Walls, and the brave generous Jack Tars of unconquered and
unconquerable Old England.
If earth hide him, light be the green turf on his breast; ifocenn cover him,calm be t h e w a . e s
on its surface ! May his spirit find rest where shades are blessed, a»d his body be shrined in the holiest cave of the deep and
silent Sea.

TRIALS A D VICISSITUDES OF A SERVANT GIRL!
Embracing situations of such deep and powerful interest!—of such supernatural

occurred within the walls of a Theatre !!!
W h y despise the • ' short and simple Annals of the P o o r ? " among which
wUl be found some of the most Interesting Events and heart-rending Scenes
in Real Life, more truly touching to the sense, and more truly speaking to
the h e a r t , than all the pompous tales of " Lordlye Knight and I.adye f a i r . "
A l a s ! how little do the Rich, revelling in wealth and l u x u r y , know of the
cares and troubles, the miseries and deprivations under which the Poor
l a b o u r ; a n d yet behold their patient suffering I I n this Drama, the fearful
Dream of Susan Hopley -the subsequent Vision -and the account of the
.Murder at the Old Manor House, are subjects of thrilling interest .--Whilst
the Servant Girl's Departure from the Home of her Childhood, and h e r
-extraordinary
Adventures in London, which eventually lead to the Discovery of the Murderers, render this Domestic Drama one of the most
powerfuUy interesting, ever yet brought forward to public notice.

Embracing situations of such deep and powerful interest!—-of such supernatural and startling effects!

thrilling anxiety of the spectator more intense and more strong at its representation., than can be
remembered ever to have occurred within the walls of a Theatre !!!

some of the most Interesting Events and heart-rending Scenes in R e a l Life, more truly
touching to the sense, and more truly speaking to the h e a r t , than all t h e pompous tales of
** Lordlye Knight and Ladye f a i r . " Alas! h o w little do t h e R i c h , revelling in wealth a n d
l u x u r y , know of the cares a n d troubles, the miseries a n d deprivations under which the
Poor labour ; and y e t behold their patient suffering! I n this D r a m a , the fearful Dream of
Susan Hopley—the subsequent Vision—and the account of the M u r d e r a t the Old M a n o r
House, are subjects of thrilling interest! -Whilst: the S e r r a n t G i r l ' s D e p a r t u r e from t h e

The Performance «ill commence with an admired Drama, by William Baylc Bernard, Esq., called THE

FARMERi STORY;
J

Examples of virtue cannot be too often brought before the Public, but more particularly in a Dramatic form, since thousands go to the
Theatre who either will not or canuot read; hence a moral stealing upon them in their amusements is their only chance of instruction; and
in spite of all objections that fanatics may raise, instruction from whatever source, is a boon to the multitude.

and startling effects!—and of such solemn and impressive appeals to the best feelings of human nature ! as to render the thrilling anxiety of the spectator more intense and more strong at its representation, than can be remembered ever to have
occurred within the walls of a Theatre! 11

W h y a-.ap.ae the " short and simple Annals of the Poor ?*» among which
will be found some of the most Interesting Events and heart-rending Scenes
In Real Life, more truly touching to the sense, and more truly speaking to
the h e a r t , t h a n all the pompous tales of " L o r d l y e Knight and Lady e f a i r . "
Alas! how little do the Rich, revelling in wealth and luxury, know of t h e
cares and troubles, the miseries and deprivations under which the Poor
l a b o u r ; and yet behold their patient suffering! I n this Drama, the fearful
Dream of Susan Hopley—the subsequent Vision- and the account of the
Murder at the Old Manor H o u s e , are subjects of thrilling interest I- W h i l s t
the Servant Girl's departure from the Home of her Childhood, and her
E x t r a o r d i n a r y Adventures in London, which eventually lead to the Discovery of the M u r d e r e r s , render this -Domestic Drama one of the most
powerfully interesting ever yet brought forward to public notice.

In the course of the Drama, an attempt will be made to realize the subject of the popular Engraving from Miss S. Setcheli's
celebrated Picture of " T h e Momentous Question." (published by Mr. Boys, Golden Square.) specially dedicated, by Royal
Command, to
H E R M O S T G R A C I O U S M A J E S T Y T H E
Q U E E N .
" 1 ask thee. Robert, lover, i-an'st tho-i part'
" She law him t'etter'd, full of grief, alone
With this poor hand when master of the heart?
Siilt as the dead ; ami he •jtippies-'-ed a gronn
At her itppe.iri.ncc Now she pr.iy'd h i strength
Wilt tho'i die, Rrtliert, or preserve thy life;
And the sad couple could converse at lenirth,"
Shall I be ihint* oivn nmid, nr .lutttet', wife ?"

evidence of Houseman, corroborated by various other persons, found guilty and adjudged to suffer death on the
scaffold—a penalty he endeavoured to evade, by an imperfect attempt at suicide—He was hung in chains In

PROGRAMME :—
Amongst the many interesting incidents with which the Piece abounds is the arrival of Travellers at the Cottage of Baptists,
who, in league with tbe desperate band, aided by his Sons, makes several attempts to accomplish
T H E M U R D E R OF R A Y M O N D ,
Who is informed of his danger by Margnerette. by means of

With which she furnishes his bed, and is by her prevented from swallowing a sleeping potion mixed in his drink by Baptista,
whom he overcomes at the moment he is about to perpetrate the Murder of Agnes : and, assisted by Margoeretle,
ACCOMPLISHES HIS DEATH.
By means of a concealed pannel, leading to a lone path through the Foiest, they, accompanied by Margnerette, escape (he
Banditti, and arrive at ihe Castle of Lindenberg. At length Raymond, amongst a train of Adventures in pursuit of Agues, encounters the S P E C T R E N U N , whom he discovers lo be the Mother of Agnes, and to whose Shade he swears from that
moment to protect her offspring : he afterwards fulfils his oath by rescuing her from the Cave of the Robbers.

A Terrific Broad Sword Combat between Don Raymond and Robert.

THE GHOST OF THE MURDERED AGNES, being appeased, blesses the union of her Child with her Deliverer, which
terminates the Drama, forming an interesting Conclusion.

YOUNG LOCHINVAR; OR, THE BRIDAL OF NETHERBY.
To conclude with a Nautical Drama, of intense interest, abounding with startling effects, called

WllARDPARK"
Or, The Mutiny at the Nore!

This remarkable point in our Naval History took place, as Is well-known, in the year 1796; and was emphatically
called by the Sailors the BREEZE at the MORE. Lately, the public attention has been more particularly directed
towards the Bulwarks of Britain than before; and the far-famed Novel of the "King's Own," and this Drama, both
relative to the subject, have excited more attention throughout the country than any literary production of the day.
The chief of the Mutineers at the Nore, was Richard Parker, a Seaman. He was a native of Exeter, and had
received a good education, after which, he went into the Navy, and became a Midshipman, but was broke for some
misconduct Having a good address and great fluency of speech, he was chosen principal of the Delegates when the
8allors rose on account of their wages and prize-money; on which occasion, he assumed the command of the Fleet
and, for his brief day of triumph, was called ADMIRAL PARKER, He ruled with great authority for some time, to
the alarm of the nation; but, when the insurrection was suppressed, he was tried and executed aboard the
-Sandwich," June 30, 1797,
