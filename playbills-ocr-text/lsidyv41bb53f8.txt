APPEAL TO THE NOBILITY, GENTRY, AND PUBLIC.
J. WEST—the Father of the Stage—upwards of half a Century (at the head of his Profession)
the approved Servant of the Public—seven years principal Dancer with Mr. Garrick in the Old
School, likewise with Mr. Foot at the little Theatre in the Hayrnarket (his competitors,
A Id ridge andSlingsby) 55 years back (when New Plays were acted without a Farce or any other
kind of Entertainment)—afterwards Ballet Master, principal Dancer, and Clown at the Theatre
Royal, Covent Garden—two Years Pupil, seven Years Apprentice, and three Years principal
Assistant to the lateSignior Grimaldi—having twice broken the Tendon of his Right Leg in his
Professional Exertions, (and having no claim on the Theatrical Fund, Dancers being excluded that
privilege)—superceded by modern talent, his professional abilities rejected, and fouried in
obscurity—after many a pang and unavailing struggle, from extreme pressure of Domestic
Distress, and other insurmountable Difficulties which now threaten to overwhelm those efforts
he has been strenuously making for years:—such is the painful urgency of his present
condition, he is constrained most reluctantly to disclose his situation, and make this appeal
to that Public who but a short time since crowded to support him, most humbly soliciting
the honor of your Name, if for one Ticktt only, it will be most thankfully received and acknowledged ; otherways, scarcely a hope remains.—His grand object being to prevent (if possible)
entering the last resource of the wretched—a Poorhouse; the idea of which, too frequent
experience has proved, deepens the dejection of an enlightened mind, and leads, by a short and
sorrowful path, to the Grave! To rescue the Veteran (nearly 70 years of age) from that
last refuge of human misery, this attempt is made, having no resource left but what may be
derived from the charitable feelings of a benevolent British Public's Liberality on this occasion.
W . within the last eighteen years being occasionally afflicted »vith an incurable cutaneous
eruption of the skin, which at times attacks him so violently for weeks, sometimes months,
together, in the Soles of his Feet and Palms of his Hands, as to deprive him of the power
of walking, standing, or holding knife or fork in his hands—he trusts that tuch unfortunate
interruptions will plead a sufficient excuse with those distinguished Patrons and others,
who have already so liberally subscribed in advance for his unavoidably delayed Benefit,
(doubly arrested in its progress by insurmountable Poverty and Fxpence;) and likewise those
Ladies and Gentlemen who have before received intimation of his intentions, at a time when
his sudden indisposition prevented him waiting on them (conformable to his promise) for
their commands, will, in consequence, allow him once more to trespass upon them with this
explanation, and thus venture tore-solicit the promised aid of their patronage.

" T H S Event on which this ficti in is founded has been supposed, by Dr. DARWIN, and some of the ihysiolo.
t'cal writers of Germany, as not of impossible occu'reiiCi'.—I shall not be suppjscd as a.'Cjrduijj the umotest
*^*Kree of si'rious faith to such an imagination; ytt, in assuming it as the La is of a work of fancy, I have not con.
*<d*red myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural t<rrors. The event on which the ink-rest . f the storjr
"•"Pend"! is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment; it was recommended by th«
'•o»liy of the situations which it dcvelopes; and, however imp issible as a physical fact, affords a puinl of viuw to
">t itna^ina'ion, for the delineating of the human passions, more comprehensive and commanding than au\, which

Miss STEPHENS
having arrived in London, in pursuance of her engagement to this Theatre,
was to have performed in a new Comick Opera, prepared expressly for her
First Appearance ; but the unabated, and unprecedented, attraction of DER
F R E I S C H l TZ has rendered it impossible, from due respect to Publick
curiosity, to suspend the representations of that very extraordinary production :
and in order that tiie musical world may, at tin same time, be gratified by the
pledged performances of tins distinguished favourite. Miss S T E P H E N S has
been prevailed on by the Manager to waive her scruples in regard to
dispossessing Miss NOEL of a part which she has heretofore sustained with
so much credit and ability, (and which Miss NOEL has cheerfully resigned it *
such distinguished Talent,) and to perform the character of Ag-nes, with
additional Sengs by WEBER, during the short term of her Engagement ;

She will appear, for the First Time, THIS EVENING.
It is respectfully submitted that a combination of Talent and attraction,
never before attempted to be formed in a Summer Theatre, is thus presented
to the notice of the Publick.
JMiss STEPHENS
will introduce an additional Song- at the commencement
of the second act; an additional Song-, and a Duet with Mr.B HAH AM, in the
third act; and Mr. BItAHAJtf
will also introduce a new Soyig-, in the third
act, in plate of his Hunting Song.—The whole being- composed by
WEBER.
The new Musical Entertainment called THE REIGN OF TWELVE HOURS continuing to
be received with unanimous applause, will be repeated this and every Evening next we/ 1c.

Miss K E L L Y
will perforin This Kvcning, in the Mr* Mttte-1 R.itertainment called T H E TiEHiN O f T t t ELVE HOLRs.

Miss STEPHENS
having arrived in London, in pursuance of her engagement to this Theatre,
was to have performed in a new Comtek Opera, prepared expressly for her
First Appearance ; but the unabated, and unprecedented, attraction of DER
F R E I S C H U T Z has rendered it impossible, from due respect to Publick
cariosity, to suspend the representations of that very extraordinary production :
and in order that the musical world may, at the same time, be gratified by the
pledged performance* of this distinguished favourite, Miss S T E P H E N S has
been prevailed on by the Manager to waive her scrupEes in regard to
dispossessing Miss NOEL of a part which she has heretofore sustained with
so much credit a n l ability, (and which Miss NOEL has cheerfully resigned to
such distinguished Talent,) and to perform the character of Agnes, with
mdditumal Songs by WEBER, during the short term of her Engagement ;

FOR ELEVEN

an it is announced with great regret that

Mr. BRAHAN and Miss STEPHENS
having, long since, concluded peremptory engagements at the Provincial
Musical Festivals, cannot possibly extend their Performances in this Theatre
beyond Wednesday, the 1st nf September, after which time the celebrated
DER F R E I S C H U T Z must necessarily be withdiawn from representation.

been prevailed on by the .Manager to waive her scruples in regard to
dispossessing Miss M ) E L of' a part whieh she has heretofore sustained with
so much credit and ability, and which Miss NOEL has cheerfully resigned to
such distinguished Talent,) and to perform the character of Agnes, with
