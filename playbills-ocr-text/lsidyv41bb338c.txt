O F M i l e & MillS.

Who beg leave to lake litis opportunity of staling to the bublic that they have
been brought here a distance ot 500 miles with the expectation of some months
engagement, but owing to a cruel and unprecdented opposition, (an opposition as heartless as it is contrary to CHRISTIAN CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE.) The Proprietor is obliged to close his doors, and thus a number
of talented, respectable, and respected individuals a e prevented from following
an art which is not only calculated to IMPROVE OUR VIRTUOUS SENSIBILITIES, RUT OFFERS ONE OF THE FINEST FIELDS FOR
T H E DEVELOPEMENT OF HUMAN I N T E L E C T — Under these circumstances S r. and Mrs. M , respectfully entreat the public to Patronise their

loss they have so suddenly and unjustly incurred.

breast patriotism, although suppressed for H time, could never be extinguished ; turned the Guns which thw had so often manned in the
defenre of the P.nglish Plat;, against their own Countrymen and their own home ; and with all the acrimony of feeling ever attending
family quarrels, seemed determined to sacrifice the nation and themselves, rather than listen to the dictates of reason and conscience."'
The present Drama, whilst it presents a true picture of the Mutiny, which for a time deprived the Nation of its surest and proudest
defence, the Bulwark of its Wooden Walls faithfully deielopes the characters of tlic chief Actors in the Rebellion, their assumption »f
their superiority to their final acknowledgment of discipline • an order, since that period unbroken by disaffection ; and winch under the
august and paternal cure of him, who is the Head and Pride of the British Navy, must proceed increasing in benelits to the service itself
and consequently in value to the Country at large.

of the

SEVEN CLERKS;
OR, THE THREE THIEVES AMI THE DENOUNCER.
' t h e following Kxtract from a French work exhibits the very extraordinary character and
events which the Drama will be found to embody,—
" In September, 1651, died in the Rood City of Marseilles, one CLAUDE DARNAUD
' h i s man, from a strange variety of circumstances, had greatly attracted the notice and
, veiled the surprise, horror and detestation of his fellow-townamen ; in the early portion of
Si's life he had been an eminent Merchant, but from a state of affluence had suddenly fallen,
•tirough the villainy of those in whom he confided, to one of compaiitive poverty. In this
situation, disgusted with traffic and deeply alloyed with misauthropy, he adopted the more
^•ofitable occupation of U s u r e r , in which avocation he contrived to amass a vast store of
wealth. T h e more extraordinary portion of his career remain, to be told :—It was h i . practice to employ one clerk, and the first young man who held that office (Rowland Aubigne)
i.ad been but a short time in his service ere he was accused of R o b b e r y ; the evidence brought
..gainst him appeared so clear, that his Judges found no difficulty in pronouncing him Guilty,
i:\d the culprit, in spite of his strong asseverations of innocence, was immediately executed.
Horrible as it may appear, every one subsequently filled t h . office was charged with a similar
crime; in each case strong circumstantial evidence was produced, and at length no less than
" SEVEN C L I i R K S " had perished on the Scaffold, the victims of this man's charges. Many
, -upled not to say that the youths were innocent, and the Denouncer was regarded with
corresponding detestation."

Will be presented the favorite Comedy of

A New Way to P a y
This Comedy is the production of Phillip Massiriger. .Ban. tui Auther not inferior to Shakespeare in picturing
the human mind;—uninfluenced by venality and depravity, he wrote to improve, not to seduce mankind, and the
purity of hia own life bore testimony to the rectitude of his design,—a contemplation of the character of Sir Giles
Overreach, being a dreadful warning to that man who endeavours by avarice and extortion to raise himself to an
unjust greatness at the expence of his fellow creatures'. Were all Dramatic Writings of a similar tendency to this,
the stage would find no enemies among persons who rightly deem no public exhibition worthy of patronage and
regard, but such as convey (as this Drama does) instruction through the channel of amusement.

October 19th, 1835,

Will be produced the celebrated Play (with New Scenery Machinery and Dresses,) entitled

HEMEYA

THE

APOSTATE;

Or, The Conquest of Grenada.

The Ground-work of this Play is borrowed from the History of Spain during the reign of Philip

jilay, and embraces the principal events during a warfare of three years.

Will be performed the interesting Mclo-Drama, entitled

IRELAND:

I*7

OR, THE

ROSE O r KERRY.
The Drama is taken from a story in a work entitled "Tales of the Muoster Festivals" and owes
its success to the deep and untiring interest growing out of a domestic tale of wonder, with the
condemnation of innocence by the staggering force of .circumstances; its hair-breadth escape
from undeserved destruction, and the unexpected detection of guilt, by the

Compunctious visitings of Conscience!
In this Drama Is the Irish character represented as it really is--romantic,
humourous, and generous.

November 4th, 1835,

Will be presented, the much-admired mclo-dramatic romance, entitled The

HBOTTLE I M P ,
The Traveller and Magician;
OR, THE SECRET

CHARM.

The story from which this piece is taken is one of those German Legends which have been the means of intraducing many of our most popular pieces upon the English t*agc. The fatal bottle containing the IMP insures the
desires and wishes of the possessor, but must be sold before death at a lower price than what it was purchased for.—
Nicolo, the original possessor, in the piece, may be seen surrounded by riches and splendour, yet wretched in all his
grandeur. The Author, who has embodied the Magic legend in a Dramatic form, has very skilfully introduced into
his work a succession of comic incidents and situations of such highly ludicrous character that it ia difficult to say
whether laughter or interest be the predominent feeling excited by the representation of this admirable Drama.

THE SECRET

CHARM.

The story from which this piece is taken is one of those German Legends which have been the means of introducing many of our most popular pieces upon the English stage. The fatal bottle containing the IMP insures the
desires and wishes of the possessor, but must be sold before death at a lower price than what it was purchased for.—
Nicolo, the original possessor, in the piece, may be seen surrounded by riches and splendour, yet wretched in all his
grandeur. The Author, who has embodied the Magic legend in a Dramatic form, has very skilfully introduced into
his work a succession of comic incidents and situations of such highly ludicrous character that it is difficult to say
whether laughter or interest be the predominent feeling excited by the representation of this admirable Drama,

NEW THEATRE.
On WEDNESDAY

EVENING,

November 25th, 1835,

'• .Will be presented (for the first time here.) a new Play, founded upon a well authenticated legend
of the Metropolis, during the l4t,b Cefitury, and dramatized with the highest effect, as Its universal
success in the Metropolitan and principal provincial THEATRES, must testify, entiltled The

W I F E Of S E V E N

IlfTGH A HTINC

HUSBANDS
OR, PEDLARS

ACRE.

The above Drama 1st founded upon it wild legend, which for some centures received in the Metropolis the most implicit belief. It related to the circumstance of a City Lady having seven
Husbands, who died in rapid succession one atter the other, without any apparent cause, which
could be traced to a medical origin , Suspicions, were at Inst excited, and upon her union with her
devepth Hnsbnnd, the citizens were in admiration at the courage of the man who had made so
perilous an adventure ; and wondered what would be the result of an experiment that had bceu
attended with sneli fatal result's. The Genius of her last Husband however, triumphs over tho
machinations of his Wife, discovers her dreadful secret, and preserves his own existence.

TOR THE BENEFIT OF

Mr. SANDERS,

Mr, S. in addressing his Friends and the Inhabitants of WELSH POOL in general, with a lively impression
of gratitude for past favours, ventures once more to solicit that patronage and support, which it has ever been his
study to merit; and should this appeal be attended with success, it will be remembered as the warmest testimony of
their kindness and approbation.

on FRIDAY

EVENING,

December 18th, 1835,

Will be presented a new DRAMA, (never acted here) entitled

T h e Knight

Holstein.

With appropriate Scenery, Dresses, and Decorations.
This celebrated Romance, of which no greater proof of merit can be adduced than, being the
production of the author of " The Castle Spectre," " Rugantino," &c. .See. created an unparalelled
sensation on its first appearance, and that it still possesses the same features of attraction is evident
in its continued success. The first of modern Poets has not disdained to employ his majic pen
upon the Wild Legend of the "Knight and the Wood Demon," and the " Deformed Transformed,"
is to Poetry, 1 what this Drama is to the Stage, of never failing interest and unquestionable merit.
*** The scene is laid in the Dutchy of Holstein, where, even at this day, the Fable is extensively and religiously believed.

On WEDNESDAY EVENING,

OCTOBER

7th, 1829,

His Majesty's Servants will present, for the first time at this Theatre, the celebrated
Historical Tragedy of

HALLACE,
THE HERO OF SCOTLAND

This popular Play is founded on facts, and bears reference to that early part of Scot.
tish History, when that celebrated Patriot, WILLIAM WALLACE—a man of honorable family, tho' of small political power.—roused the dormant energies of his country,
and by his personal bravery and heroic example, instilled a love of liberty into the breasts
of his followers, and led them tp glory and victory. Thrice did he rescue his native land,
from bondage, and at last this noble Spirit perished by the treachery of the friend ii;
whom he most confided.

t o the unknown Author of those Novels which have for the last seven Years entertained the reading part of the
-Population of England, and rescued our Country from the disgrace of those Romances which have brought discredit
on the works of fiction, the Public are indebted for the Musical Drama of IVAN HOE—which was acted 40 successive Nights at the Theatre-Royal, CovenUGarden. In the present Play, the Author was compelled to adopt the
conceptions, and in many places, the language of the Writer of the Novel, wherever they seemed likely to
Strengthen the plan prescnbed; and where indeed could he find a better model than the superior Author of ."Tales

of my Landlord.

The MANAGERS anxious in catering f6r the Public to produce genuine Talent, with
pleasure announce, that they have engaged far THREE NIGHTS ONLY, the celebrated

MR. BOOTH,
Of the Theatre-Royal,

Drury-Lane;

now on his way to

Plymouth.

The splendid and masterly acting displayed by that great and popular Tragedian, Mr. REAN,
shines not less conspicuous in the Performance of this Gentleman ; and by many able judges of the
Histrionic Art, the preference has been given to hint. The great and striking resemblance 09, the
Stage, in figure and face, he bears to Mr. KEAN, is truly astonishing—the more so when it is
considered that this was discovered before he had ever seen that Gentleman, and is an endowment
of Nature, not the acquirement of Art. He is justly ranked Mr. KEAN's successful competitor,
and it is a matter of congratulation to the lovers of the Drama, that now that Gentleman is on the
point of crossing the Atlantic, he leaves so able a Representative behind him.

Performance—Thursday,

Mr. & Mrs,
ON WEDNESDAY EVENING, SEPT. 21,1831,
Will be presented (first time these 6 Years) the Grand Romantic PLAV of

The

EXILE.

Tien interesting Piece is taken from Madame Cottin's celebrated work, "Elizabeth ; or the Exile of Siberia." The story, sentiments, and
nu*t striking situation., are closely copied from the original, which ba* been universally read and admired throughout Europe, and translated
into almost every language. Were the narrative merely the creation of Fancy, it would he con-idered us uffectiiij; a fiction as ever met the
public eye ; but as it is generally known to he founded on truth, and tp be actually an nnembelli-.lie.il fact, ten-fold sympathy is excited by .ts
dramatic representation. The Heroine of this piece was a character that really existed in our own times, who undertook a dangerous and
painful journey sf several thousand miles, over tract ICH snows and inlicpitable deserts, to throw herself at the feet of her Sovereign at ber
coronation, and implore pardon for an honourable but exiled Father ! ! !

W I T H T H E O R I G I N A L S C E N E R Y E X H I B I T E D LAST SEASON W I T H G R E A T A P P L A U S E .
The Hero of this Piece was Chief of a lawless Band, lt.fe.ttin-the Mountains near Rome. No place was secure from his emissaries, nnd so
skilful were his disguises, that he was frequently made the contidant of plots laid by his enemies to entrap him. Such an air of gallantry
and chivalry accompanied his depredations, that they were frequently the theme of laudatory rhymes, and those who paid the dearest far
his pranks were often the first to laugh at his humour.

TRAGEDY

of

George Barnwell;
OR, T H E LONDON MERCHANT.
THIS affecting Tragedy, the moral tendeuey of which his been no benifieal to the ris ng generations, wa, founded upon f» c t.
The unfortunate hero of the piece, was execut d for the murder <il his v rtunu* and venerable Uncle, in the leign of Queen
K l u b e t h : to which he was instigated by an artful cruel, and abandoned W»m*ii| step by §lep she led the unwary Youlli to the
last cruel deed, which terminate,, a miserable existence, by the most .-nonii.iis death.
A slor> is reported, and the fact can he proved by many livi .- witnesses, that a young Gentleman of the City of London, having
embezzled part of hi» Master's property, w..« providentially at the representation o f " GKOHOB BARNWELL,'' at Drurj Lane, w h e .
the admirable acior Mr. Mos,, personated George Karnwell, at whose fate he was so ,truck, that it occasioned his immediate
contrition and reformation.
The Gentleman so benefited by this excellent Tragedy was not ashamed to own his obligation to the
Play and Performer, for,at every subsequent yearly benefit, Mr Moss, received a hundred pounds sterling, with a card to the
following effect:
" Dear Sir.
One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George RamweM for more than life ! for hi, redeemed
honor and credit I begs your acceptance of the enclosed, wh ch sum you will receive \ early as long as vou continue it, your p r o .
fession
Happy im 1 t<> acknowledge that the Sta;e has prevented me from ruin and disgrace, GhOiUiE UAKN VVKi.L (topped mc
in my mad career, ami saved me from an ignominious death.
| n.,, &p.
A CONVERT."

his enemies to entrap him,—Such an air of gallantry and chivalry accompanied his depredations that they were frequently the
tbeme of lauditory rhymes, and those who paid the dearest for his pranks, were often the first to laugh at his humour.

The Story on which lh':s Drama is founded possesses peculiar claim, on the sympathy and approbation of the Public. The Count
St Angcville being left guardian to the young and interesting Amy CaMonette, involve, her fortune by a career of dissipation and
extravagance, the hand of hi, ion Victor i» destined for Amy, but her affectum having been given to the Count Rosenford, St.
A.revilte, lo avoid disgrace.

Resolves on the M i W D E R of the Innocent Amy,
TO EFFECT WHICH HE EMl'LOYS THE SAVAUE (IF THE FOREST.
But providentially Amy and Violette bavin,; changed bed chambers, the I'agg r of the Assassin i , directed to the bosom o '

On Wednesday, 27th September, 1837,
Will be presented for the first time, with New Scenery, Dtesses, and Decorations, &c. &c. an entiiely New
Peregrinating Piice of Incident, Character, and Manner*, called the

PickwickiaRs
Founded on " B o z ' s " Posthumous Papers of the P I C K W I C K C L U B , by the Author of " T O M & J R U R Y . ' '
t S - In attempting to dramatize the far-tamed Pickwick paper-, the Adapter trusts, iliat the liberties he h;,s necessarily been obliged to take
with their inimitable author " BOZ," will not be considered presumptuous. I lie m«al graphic writer of any ai>e or country, " Hot1' presents
o the dramatilt both peculiar advantages and peculiar difficulties ;—lie is a painter in print, with all the finish, minuteness, and truth to nature,
of the Dutch School;—a aort of pen andinjc actor, pitting vividly before us. "in th.ir t'nrin and ha'iit, as they live." every character in lite,
from the highest to the lowest ;—in abort, tor whim, and humour, and the power ot delineating a character by a touch, he may truly be regarded
At the verbal CrttikshSnk ut the day. To meddle with so extraordinary a writer, therefore is as dangerous as it is enticing ; the desultory nature
if the adventures ill which he has revelled, Hnd the absence of that continuity ot plot -o essential in*, dramatic piece, has also been the subject
.I'much embaras.inent ami has led the ad.iper to draw on hi. own rcsouices very frequently, when he would more gladly have availed himself of
the superior material of his master, but lie had no alternative , Ins HUM ha. been by a necessary compression and condensation, to embrace all the
leading end dramatic points ol bis prototype. Late experience has enabled him to bring Mr. Pickwick's aflftiis to a conclusion rather sooner
than his gifted Biographer has done, if not so aatisfaciorily a< could be wished, at all events quite legally. With these observations all parties
concerned, throw themselves on the kindness ei their best Patrons the Public! and if only in honor of thetr original, the popular favorite " B o i , "
confidently anticipate a patient hearing ami an impartial judgement.

Founded on - Boss's* Posthumous Papers of t'n- PICKWICK CLOU, by the Author of •' Tor. & JBKRY."

CT- I n a t t e m p t i n g to dtamatiae Hie far-lameil Pickwick papers, tlie A d a p t e r trusts, thai t h e liberties he has necessarily been obliged to tuk*
with their iiiimitaljle author " B O Z " will not b e considered p r e s u m p t u o u s . The m n . l graphic writer of any a g e or country, ' • B o s ' ' presents
to the dramatist both peculiar advantages and peculiar difficulties ;—he is a painter in print, with all (lie finish, minuteness, aiid truth t o nature,
of the Dutidi School ; — t »ort of pen and ink actor, placing vividly before u«, " i n th»di form and ha'dt, as they live." every character in lite,
'vdm the highest to the lowest ; — in short, tor whim, and humour, ami the power ot delineating a character by a touch, he may truly be r e g a r d e d
s the verbal t i u i k - . l i . n k ot the d a y . To meddle with so extraordinary a writer, theietore i« as dangerous as it is enticing ; the desultory nature
f the advent in es in which he has IT vr lied, and the absence of that continuity ot plot M essential in a d r a m a t i c piece, has also been the subject
much e m b a r a ' s m e n t and ha" led the a d a p t e r to d r a w on his own r e s u m e N very frequently, when he would more gladly have availed himself of
tie superior mat-rial of h i . m a s t e r , but he had no alternative ; his aim has been by a necessary compression and condensation, to embrace all the
admg and d r a m a t i c points ot his p r o t o t y p e . Late experience ban enabled him to bring Mr. P i c k w i c k ' , affaiis to a conclusion rather jooner
'lan his gifted Biographer has d o n e , if not so satisfactorily a- could b - wi»b<d. at ail events quite legally. With these observations all parties

CONSTANCE, A R T H U R , SALISBURY.

Arthur,—I do beseech you,Madame,be content.
Constant*.—If thou, that bidst me be content,
wert grim,
Ugly and sland'rous to thy mother's womb,
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
Patched with foul moles and eye offending
mark,
I would not care, I then would be content,
For then I should not love thee.

DURING WHICH, VVU,L BE l i X U m i T E D A \ KNUKELY NEW AND SPLENDID SKRIF... OK

SELECTED

FEAR.
SCENE—THE JUNGLE.
Mother and Child.
First, Fear, hi, hand, its skill to try,
'Amid the chords bewildered laid;
And back recoiled he knew not why,
Ev'n at the sound himself had made.

ANGEU.
SCENE-WAT TYLER'S SMITHY.
Wat Tyler, Tyler'e Daughter, Tax Cojfectcri.
Next Anger rush'd, his eyes on fire,
In lightnings own'd his secret stings;
ID one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept with hurried hand the strings.

DESPAIR.
SCENE—THE DUNGEON, from Sir J.
Reynolds's picture of " Ugulino."
Uffolino, Children, Keeper.
With woeful measures wan Despair—
Low sullen sounds his grief beguiled,
A solemn, strange, and mingled air,
'Twa* sad by fits, by ,tans 't«»s wild.

FROM TilE ODE.
HOPS.

SCENE-THE SEA "HOUE.
tfnjfotU Wife, Children,
But thou, Oh, Hope! witb eyes ta fair,
What Was thy delighted measure ?

SCENE—THE CONVENT.
The Novice, Lady Abticn, and Sitter.
Pale Melancholy sat retired.
And from her wild M cjuester'd seat,
la notes by distance tumlo more sweet,
Pour'd thro' the mellow horn her pauaivt, soul.

SCENE—THE CITV ASSAULTED.
Warriort.
But with a frown—Revenge impatient rose,
And threw his blocji-staiii'd sword.
In thunder down!

CheerJFulneta

and

Joy.

SCENE—THE PLAIN, from a plctur. of
Guido Reui's Group, of bacchanals.
Satyr't, Uport, Nyntphe.
Satye, and Sylvan boys wtr. teen
Peepingfrom forth their alleys green.
Brown Exercise rejoiced to bear,
And Sport leaped up and seized hi* beMh.ii
spear.

PITY.
SCENE-SACJCD AND BURNING CITY.
Victorioui Warrior, Proitratt Warrior, Female.
Dejected Pity at his tide
Her soul subduing voice applied,
Yet still be kept his wild unalter'd mien.

M EJMscHOL r.

Combination

of Tableau**.

Ev'n all at once together found
Cecilia's mingled world of sound;
Oh, bid our vain endeavours CCUM.
Revive the just designs of Greece,
Return in ,11 thy simple state,
Confirm the tales her sons relate.

JEALOUSY.
SCENE—THE GARDEN.
The Lover, the Hueband, the Wife.
Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed,
Sad proof of thy distressful state.

1 o conclude with the New Historical Drama, tu J Acts, called

JOAN of ARC:
OR, THE MAID OF ORLEANS.

The M A I D of ORLEANS was the glory and shame of the age in which she lived—her heroic deeds and miserable
end fill one bright and glorious page in history, which with all its boasted d'gnity is but a record of the injustice,
superstitions, and cruelties of mankind. In the village of Doinremi, near Vancouleurs, on the borders of Lorraine,
there lived a Country Girt named JOAN of ARC—this Girl was of an irreproachable life, and had not hitherto been
remarked for any singularity :—whether she had met with no occasion to excite her genius, or that the unskilful
eyes of those who conversed with her had not been able to discern her great merit. The Siege ot Orleans, the
progress of the English before that place, the great distress of the Garrison and Inhabitants, the importance of
saving the City had turned thither the public eye, and JOAN inflamed by the general sentiment-, was seized with
the wild desire of bringing Relief to Her Sovereign, in his present distress. The Raising of the Siege of Orleans
was one part of the maid's promise to Charles, The Crowning of him at Rheims was the other, both of which
she accomplished ; but Joan was so long surrounded by inveterate enemies that she feli .ier Spirits at last subdued;
her revelations were believed to be inventions of the Devil, to delude the people, & she was at length Condemned

The Infant.
At first the Infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms :

T h e whining School Boy.
And then the whining school boy, with bis Mtohel,
And .hining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school :

T h e Lover.
And then the lover,
Sighing like fnrnaee, with a woeful ballad
I4.de to his mistress' eye-brow

The Soldier.
Then, a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the buble reputation
Even at the cannon's mouth :

Tlie J u s t i c e .
And then, the justice,
In fair round belly, with good capon lin'd,
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances,
And so he pbiys his part.

Tlie l e a n a n d s l i p p e r ' d
Pantaloon.

The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon ;
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side ;
liis youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank ; and his big manly voice,
Turning again lo.vards childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his Round:

Second Cliildishness.
Last scene of all.
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

SHAKESPEARE'S
EARLY DAYS.

In those day-dreams of fancy which persons of a certain temperament are wont to indulge, we have pictured to our imagination Shakespeare and his tim..»
His Majestic countenance, from the contemplation of which Dryden caught inspiration, has been rudely, yet faithfully preserved • his mind is hest ««n in'
hi. works. On the few incident, recorded in his life, we dwell with fond enthusiasm. His boyhood, courtship, marriage—his wild exploits in the nark of
Sir Thomas Lucy, (the ecene of " As you like it,")—his bitter lampoon on the "Parliament Member,"—his retreat from Stratford , arrival in London • a c
cidental encounter with the player,;—his appearance as an actor and author ;—and the flrst dawning of his mighty genius. That the muse had vouchsafed
him her inspirations, and opened to his infant eyes the gates of immortality j that she had haunted his visions by day, and his dreams L-y night is not the ficpriz'd
earth,:—
"What ardent hopes, what golden dreams.

COMBAT with Two REAL

STICKS.

The whole to conclude with the Favourite Burlesque Nautical Burletta, entitled—

BILLY TAYLOR,
Or, T H E GAY YOUNG FELLOW.

"

The ballad of Billy Taylor is purely nautical: it describes the effect, of love, jealousy, and revenge, in the breast of a young maiden
whose gallant had played her false. One of its chief beauties is its simplicity, and characteristic appropriation of language,—the very
name is familiar and endearing; it is the " Animula blandula," the little soul, that Pope dwells on with such peculiar complacency. Gay.
we think, falls into affectation when he makes Black-eyed Susan exclaim—
" Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true,
If my sweet William sails among your crew."
We should lose all association of the " madcap Prince of Wales," were wAo substitute for the familiar Harry and Hal, to pompou.
Henry
Let us for a moment imagine those quaint humourists of olden time, Tony Aston Joe M.lte,. Sam Foote Ned Shuter
and Dickey Suett. elevated into Mr. Antony Aston, Mr. Joseph Miller, Mr. Samuel Foote, Mr. Edward SUu.er, aud Mr. Richard buett!
The Hero of this ballad is well described in the opening stanza :—
" Billy Taylor was a gay young fellow,
Fall of fun and full of glee ;
And hie mind he did diskiver,
To a Lady SW and Free."

THE NEW SCENERY BY MR. R. CORRI.
John Peerybmgle, (the Carrier)
M r . G. S M Y T H S O N .
" That lumbering, slow, honert John, that John so heavy, but BO light at spirit; so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the core ; so dull
without, so quick within ; so stolid, but so good.
°
Tackleton, (the Toy Maker)
Mr. SHALDERS.
•' He didn't look much like a Bridegroom at he stood in the Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face and a screw in hi* body, and hi.) hat
jerked over the bridge of his nose, and his hands stuck down into the bottom of the pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self peering out of
one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number of ravens,''
Caleb Plummer, (his M a n )
Mr. FIELDING.
" A little, meagre, thoughtful, dirty faced man, who seemed to have made himself a great coat from the sack cloth covering of some old b o i ,
for when he turned to shut the door, he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription C and T in large black capitals "
T h e Stranger
Mr. GLADSTONE.
- His garb was very quaint and odd—a long, long way behind the time. He had long white hair; good features singularly bold and well defined
for an old man ; and dark, bright, penetrating eyei."
M r s Peerybingle. (familiarly known as Dot)
Mrs. H . FRAZER.
" Fair «he was, and young—though something of what is called the dumpling shape; but I don't myself object to that."
Bertha, (Caleb Flummer'g blind child)
Miss J O S E P H I N E .
'• She and her father lived all alone by themselves, as the Story Books say—and my blessing: with yours to back it I hope : on the Story Books,
for saying anything in this workaday world."
May Fielding
Miss L E W I S .
" Tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question. May wa, very pretty.''
M r s Fielding, (her Mother)
Mrs. SHALDERS.
" An old lady with a peevish face, was very genteel and patronizing. The majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap calculated to inspire
the thoughtless with sentiments of awe."
Miss Slowboy. (a foundling)
Mr. DOUGHTY.
" The maternal and parental Slowboy were alike unknown to fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity a Foundling, which word though
differing from Fondling by one vowel's length, is very different in meaning, and expresses other things."
Dott's Father and Mother
M r . D E A R L , and M r s C L A R K E .
Spirit of t h e Cricket
Miss E . S H A L D E R S .
" The Cricket of the Hearth came out into the room, and stood in fairy shape before them." Neighbour's, Relations, &c.

A DOUBLE HORNPIPE,

BY MISS ELLEN ROLLS and MISS ELLEN SHALDERS.
To be followed by an entirely New and Original Drama, called—The

CRICKET ON THE HEARH I
A F A I R Y TALE OP HOME.

J o h n Peerybingle, (the Carrier)
Mr. G. SMYTHSON.
" That lumbering, slow, honest John, that John so heavy, but so light at spirit; so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the cor? ; so dull without, so quick within j so stolid, but so good."
Tackleton, (the Toy Maker)
Mr. SHALDERS.
" He didn't look much like a bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face and a screw in his body, «nd his hat jerked over the bridge of his nose, and his
hands stuck down into the bottom of the pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self peering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated eF jnce of any number
of ravens."
Caleb Plumtner, (his M a n )
.Mr. FIELDING.
" A little, meagre, thoughtful, dirty-faced man, who seemed to have made himself a great coat from the sack-cloth covering of some old box ; for when he turned to shut the door, lie
disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription C and T in large black capitals."
T h e Stranger,
Mr. G L A D S T O N E .
" His garb was very quaint and odd—a long wav behind the time. He had long white hair, good features, singularly bold and well-defined for an old man, and dark, bright, penetrating eyes."
M r s . Peervbingle, (familiarly known as Dot)
Mrs. H . FRAZER.
" Pair she wa«, and young—though something of what is called the dumpling shape; but I don't myself object to that."
«_„_.„„ „ T „
Bertha, (Caleb H u m m e r ' s blind child)
.......iSin
JOSEPHINE.
,, .
" She and her father lived all alone by themselves, as ths Story Books say—and my blessing; with yours to back it I hope : on the Story Books, for saying anything in this workaday world .
Miss
May Fielding
LEWIS.
"Tackleton was a man of taste, beyond all question. May was very pretty.
Mrs
M r s Fielding (her Mother)
- »HALDERfe.
" An old lady with a peevish face' was very genteel and patronising. The majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe."

Miss Slowbov (a Foundling)

Mr

- DOUGHTY.

- The maternal and paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to fame,~-and Tilly had been bred by public charity a Foundling, which word, though differing from Fondlinff by one vowel'.

MERCHANT OF

VENICE!

• The quality of mercy is not struin'd ;
It is an attribute of God himself;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.
And earthly power doth then shew likest Ood'a
Upon the place beneath ; it is twice bless'd ;
VVhen mercy seasons justice: therefore, Jew,
If. blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:
Though justice be thy plea, consider this—
"Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
That, in the course of justice, none of us
The throned monaich better than his crown :
Should see salvation ; we do pray for mercy ;
His sceptre shews the force of temporal power. And thateame prayer doth teach us all to render
The attribute to awe and majesty,
The deeds of mercy ; I have spoke thus much.
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ;
To mitigate the justice of thy plea ;
But mercy is above the scepter'd sway—
Wdieh if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
I t is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
Must needs give sentence'gainst the merchant there,'*

W I L L BE P R E S E N T E D ,

That CELEBRATED TRAGEDY, Called,

George Barnwell:
N

OR, THE

LONDON MERCHANT.
** Be warn'd ye Youths, who fee my fad defpair,
" Avoid lewd Women, falfe as they are fair."
LILLO.
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which lias been fo very beneficial to the rifing generation, is one of the
plays lately revived in Drury-Lane The Manager thinks he cannot better difcharge his duty to the Public of Whitehaven,
than by performing it alfo ia this place.
SHAKESPEARE fays, that
•• Guilty creatures fitting at a play,
" Have, by the very cunning of the fcene,
" Been itruck fo to the foul, that prefently
" They have proclaim'd their malefactions." HAMLET.
A ftory is recorded, and the fact, can be proved by many living witnelTes, that a young Gentloman of the city of London,
having embezzled part of his matter's property, was providentially at a reprefentation of George Barnwell at Drury-Lane,
when that admirable actor, Mr. Ross, perfonated the character of George Barnwell, at whofe fate he was fo ftruck to the
foul, that it occafioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman fo benefited by this excellent Tragedy,
was not afhamed of acknowledging his obligations to the play and the performers; for, at every fubfequent yearly benefit of
Mr. Rofs, he received One Hundred Pounds fterling, with a card to the following Effect:
•' Dear Sir, One who is indebted to your admirable reprefentation of George Barnwell, for more than life, for his redeemed honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the inclofed, which you will receive yearly, fo long as you continue in
the line of your profeffion. Happy am I to acknowledge that the ftage has preferred me from ruin and difgtace.—George
Barnwell ftopt me in my mad career, and faved me from an ignominious death.
\
I am your grateful friend and fervant,*
A CONVERT."
Where inftruftion can be blended with amufement, every good parent will be anxious,—every matter will be defirous,—
and every teacher will recommend the attendant of their pupils. That the Tragedy of George Barnwdl expofes vice, and
the never failing confequencei, while it exhorts and ftimulates the youth of both fexet to the practice of virtue, the grcateft
enemy to the Theatre will not deny, furely then k cannot gi-e offence, if it is earneftly recommended to the head, of families, and indeed earneftly folicited of them, that they will permit the young people under their protection, to be prefent at
-the reprefentation of the moral, inftructive, and awful Tragedy of G E O R G E B A R N W E L L .
" Learn to do Well from others ill,
* And you (hall do full well."
LILLO.
This play, it may be depended npon, was founded on faft ; the unfortunate hero of the Tragedy, George Barnwell,
was executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle , to which he was inftigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned woman, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth i ftep by ftep fhe led the unwary yonth, to the laft cruel deed which terminated a miferable exiflence by the moil ignominious death.

T H I Manager, anxious to gratify the WHITEHAVEN Audience with every Novelty that hi. abilities can eompaf., or
even LONDON produce, is nappy that he is at length enabled to prefent them with a Comedy which hasfo univerfally
excited the Attention of the Public, and the Merits of which have been unequivocally confirmed by a Run of Suceefs
in the Metropolis, unequalled by any former Piece, GAV'J Beggar's Opehi, and SHERIDAN'S School for Scandal, not

The principal Aim of Mr. CHERRY in THE SOLDIER'* DAUGHTER, is unitedly to cheriih the Relpefl for
Commerce by which Great Britain has reached fuch envied and unrivalled Splendor, with the martial Ardour to neceffary at this Moment to protett thole Riches from a foreign Spoiler, and her Liberties from the Tyrant of Holland,
Italy, and Switzerland.

" And give your Voices in Support of Trade.——

a appointed Tor hi) Benefit.
Mr. B ii sorty to hear of the «n»i«<i and malicious Reports that have been circulated, by secret Enemies, with intent to injure hti Intense, and lessen the Estimation
he has the honor of holding; he is well convinced the Inhabitants of the Town are too
liberal to pay the smallest Attention to them, yet he conceives it his Duty tc explain the
Nature of his Engagement, and why he advertises a S I C O N P Benefit. In the firtt
Instance, it is literally hi. Agreement; iu the second, he has performed here eighteen
Week., during which period, the Eipences attendant on his professional Duties (hating
to furnish his own Dresses) has far exceeded the Profits of his Benefit: thirdly, Mt. B .
has sustained a Number of arduous Characters, very much to the Injury of his Health J
he therefore conceives these Circumstances a sufficient Keasm for his second Application. As to professional Abilities, on that Subject he is silent, the Public being the
best Judges of his Claim, in that particular.

T H E MANAGER most respectfully solicits the Indulgence and Interest of
' e Ladies and Gentlemen of WHITEHAVEN, and a generous Public, in his

Behalf:—The recent Circumstance of being deprived (at a short Notice) of
performing at WORKINCTON, precludes the Possibility of a Removal, with a
numerous Company, to a distant Part of the Kingdom, prior to opening the
Tieatre at LANCASTER for the Spring Assizes, which occasions a Vacation
of three Weeks, with the heavy Expence of the Performers Salaries during
that Interval. Under these Circumstance, the Profits of the Season will be
reduced to a mere Trifle, notwithstanding the very liberal Suppprt he has experienced. He humbly hopes this Consideration will plead in his favour for
announcing THREE NIGHTS further PERFORMANCE, in hope that the
Approbation and Support of the indulgent and liberal Audie.qce of Whitehaven
may be obtained.

of the

FAMILY LEGEND;
Or, The HIGHLAND
(Written

CHIEFTAINS.

by JOANNA

BAILLIE,
Authoress of the ctlebrated Plays on the Human Passions, Sec )
With new and characteristic Scenery, Presses, and Decorations.
The plot of this Play has been taken from a legend long preserved in the family of the maternal ancestors of the Hon. Mrs. Datti*r,
M whom it appeared well fitted to produce strong effect on the Mage. Upon reading it over, »uT authoress c.incided with her in
ilnioD j it was besides, a story of her native land; and being at the time in quest of some subject for the drama, she eagerly seized
i pon it, and was glad to be permitted to make use of it. The substance of the story is as follows:
« In the ISth century, a feud had long subsisted between the Lord of Argyll and the Chieftain of Maclean; the latter was totally"
subdued by the Campbells, and Maclean sued for Peace, demanding at the same time, in marriage the young and beautiful daughter
-•f Argyll. His request was granted, and the lady carried home to the island of Mull. There she had a son. but the Macleans w r e
k to thi. alliance with the Campbells..—They swore to desert then Chief if they were not suffered to put his wife to death, w-.tji
n»r infant son, who was then at nurse, that the blood of the Campbellsmighr not succeed to the iiieritance of Maclean, Macleaa
-:si.ted these threats, fearing the power and vengeance of Argyll; butat length fear for his own life, should he refuse the demand.
; his clan, made him yield to their fury, and he only drew from them I promise that they would Hot shed her b'oid. Or.e d -Jt
•« inter night she was forced into a boat, and regardless of her cries and lmentations, left upon a, barren rock, mid-way between t h .
i iast» of Mull and Argyll, width at high water, is covered with the sea As she was about to perish, she saw a boat steenngStf
- rnrse at some distance; she W3ved her hand, and uttered a feeble cry. She was now upon the top of the rock, and the water a.
s igh as her breast, so that the boatmen'mistook her for a large bird. They took her however from tie rock, and knowing her
*.)&<• the daughter of Argyll, carried her to the castle of her father,
" The Earl rewarded her deliverers, and desired them to keep the cirsumstance secret for a time, during which he concealed heft
t II he should hear tidings from Mull. Maclean solemnly announced hei death to Argyll, and soon can.e himself with his friends, all
' mourning, to condole with the Earl at his castle. Argyll received hjn, clad also In black. Maclean was full of lamentations; t h .
•arl appeared very sorrowful; a feast was served with great pomp in the hall; every ou» tno^ j , is pi., cei .yhik « seat was left empttf
i a the right hand r r '
! Me. Maclean i
<Me of the castle,
:.ic the child, who had been preserved by the affection of the nurse,
" The deserving daughter „f Argyll was rewarded for her sufferings by wedding, with her father's consent, an amiable youog
ai-Inman who adored hiir, and was mutually beloved. To this man her father had formerly refused her hand, disposing of her a.
4 bond of union, to unite the warring clans of A.gyll and Maclean."

Mr. W. BURROUGHS respectfully begs leave to intimate to the
Gentry and Public, that he has made every possible exertion to bring before
them an efficient Company, and trusts that a disposition will be evinced to
support him in his efforts to cultivate a Dramatic Taste, and retain a respectable
and well conducted Theatre in Whitehaven.
For a considerable time back, the Theatre has been a losing spec ulatiort.
It has remained unoccupied for two successive Seasons, and unless the Public
make an effort to protect the Management from loss, in all probability, all
Dramatic^Amusement will be banished from the Town.
Mr. BURROUGHS regrets being obliged to state, that should no dis«
position be shewn to extend a fair share of patronage to himself and company,
he must bring his Season to a speedy termination, and take his Farewell of
Whitehaven.

VAMPIRE 9
or, The Bride of the Isles.

This Drama is founded upon one of the darkest and most extraordinary superstitions ever recorded In
the anuals of the human mind. Scarcely more than a century ago, almost all ,the circumstances of
which it is composed, with the addition of many others still more wild and horrible, were not only (irmly
believed by the peasants of the Sclavonian villages, among whom they were originally stated to have
happeaed. and were received not only as truths, but seriously reasoned upon by several learned Divines
and Physicians. A similar superstition appears to have prevailed in B .hernia and Silesia—it is very
common in countries of the East—among the Arabians it is also general.—Tn many purts o) Greece it is
considered a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whiist in * vistem-e, an<;
the deceased is doomed not only 10 Vampyrise, but be compelled to confine bis visitations BoleJy to ihoutt
being, he loved mo.' whilu on earth.

EXTRACT FROM T H E THEATRICAL CHRONICLE, LONDON.
'' Probably since the days of the great Matter Betty, no person has created so mut-h sensation in the
Circles in which he has appeared, as the Young Gentleman whose name figures'at the head of this article. The developetnent of genius in a young mind must ever be an interesting study, and we shall therefore make no apology for introducing
to our readers this individual, who has by his talents secured a degre.) of fame in the highest vvalks of a difficult profession.
On the 12th of December, 182J, at 129, 'Strand, the subject of the present memoir, Mr QtiOUGU O W E N , was born, and
early evincing a disposition for the Stage, on the 12th of July, 1837, made his first Appearance at the Theatre Royal,
Birmingham; although his success was immense, he did not make his Second Appearance for eight months, viz. at the
Newcastle Theatre, on the Gtlvof March. The applause with which he was received was beyond all precedent; his age
and the nice discrimination he displayed in developing even the little puints in the characters he undertook, at o n e .
stamped him as the 'Koscius of the Day,' It was not to be imagined that rumour with her thouiaud tongues would be long
in wafting to the Metropolis the name of a child possessing such extraordinary talents. Mr. Davidge hearing of his fame,
tendered him an engagement, and on the 13th of November, 1838, he made his first bow to a London audience, at the Royal
Surrey Theatre, in the character of Young Norval, he being the first juvenile who had appeared since the days of young
B u r k e ; the house was all expectation. The surprising powers which he possessed, carried all before him, and in the fifth
act the house rose EN MASSK, and greeted him with applause. At the close of his Engagement, he was retained expressly
for the character of Oliver Twist, which was produced on the 19th, and repeated that character for nearly One Hundredand
Fifty Nights, As a Shakspeariau Actor he is possessed of talents of the first-rate order. The provincial Press has been
lavish in it. praise of him, and we can only add our testimony to his abilities by saying, that they nave in every respect been

Mrs. CARLTON liaving recovered from her Accident, will appear on
Monday next in the character of OPHELIA.

On THURSDAY Evening, Dec. 10, 1846,
Will be Performed, (first time in Whitehaven) Lord Byron's Tragedy of

WERNER!
OR, THE INHERITANCE.
This Tragedy, which it is said Lord B Y R O N never intended to he performed,
but which in action has been universally declared to be One of the MOST
P O W E R F U L L Y I N T E R E S T I N G TALES ever Dramatized, the interest being
kept up to the last Scene with the most admirable taste. The original story on
which the Drama is founded, is in Miss L K E ' S Canterbury Tales, and called
• ' T h e GERMAN'S T A L E , "

Wao-r.-

" Who would read in this form the high soul of the son of a long line ?
Who, in this garb, the heir of Princely land ?
M ho, in this sunken, sickly eye, the pride of rank and ancestry ?
In this worn cheek and famine-hollowed blow, the Lord of Halls,
Which daily feast a thousand vassals "

FOR T H E B E N E F I T O F

M R S . T. R O B E R T S O N .
This present FRIDAY EVENING, JUNE 2nd, 1826,
Will be presented Shakespeare's Comedy of T h e

T W E L F T H NIGHTS
OR, WHAT YOU WILL.
This beautiful Comedy is said to be the l » t and certainly is one of the must delightful
productions of Shakespeare's pen, and a splendid proof that the Poet's wit end playfulness
of fancy continued unabated to the last. The number of thoughts orouded into a short
space and linked together by the most natural transitions, the ingenuity of the situations,
and the harmonious blending of the characters, have ever been the theme of critical encomium. The comic parts stand on equal elevation, and possess equal extent and profu.dity.
The good hnmoured Swaggering Knight, Sir Toby, and his ludicrous shadow. Sir Andrew
Aguecheek, afford a striking contrast to t h e sombre and more poetie characters of the
D u k e , Olivia, and Viola, and fully justify the conclusion of one of the besecommentators
on our immortal Poet—''we may here laugh at tlie absurdities of human nature without
learning to despise ihem." The distinguished approbation the revival of this Play has met
with in London, must ever be a source of congratulation from its having restored another
Shakesperiau Play to the acting drama of the present age.

OR, T H E CASTLE O F OLIVAL.
The Wandering Boys, the charterers from which this interesting Melo-drama takes its
title, are deprived of their inheritance by the usurpation of the Baroness, who contrives to
have them in infancy taken from their domain, and left to perish with their helpless mother
In a foreign land; on her death-bed she confides testimonials of their just claim in valuable
jewels, with an injunction not to open the casket till the elder comes of age. O a her decease the two boys set forth, not knowing where to wander.—Providence, that ever ruling
Guardian of Innocence, leads them to the very gates of their oppressor, who ever on the
watch lest her guilty secret should be betrayed, endeavours to obtain a knowledge of all
stray children of the same age as her victims, that chance brings near the castle.—The
piece opens at this interesting period.—The Count de Croissey is a most powerful delineation of character; the boys are truly effective in natural pathos; and the ludicrous finish
of its comic characters make a pleasing variety.

T TT F

D E L I V E R E R of his C O U N T R Y .
(Written

by W. WHITEHEAD,

Bjj; late Poet Laureat, to his Majejly.)

Amongft the various Sobjefts, which dramatic AjH.tw.#,W« torm'd their interesting and affefting Scene., no one has
i-been more happily chofen than the Story which gives Foundation to the R o M A N F A T H E R , The Ardor for libem
and the then rifing State of Rome, animated its Heroes to an Enthufufm fcarec felt by any other State at that Time ex'
tiling. That Congeniality of Sentiment implanted in the Breaft of a B it i T O N, muft give him a molt pleafiiif- Exulta"
tion, when he beheldl the Reprefentation of this mafterly Performance. The Rival States of Rome, and Alba envious
of each others advancing Glory, rulh'd to the Field, to d*cide the Pride of Emoire and Superiority. The Coniinguinitv
o. Blood by intermarriages, induced the Roman King, TullmUofillius tooppofe the-dreadfu) Hazard of a bloody and ee
&enl Carnage. Three Chiefs from each State by Agre«i-.nt were appointed to determine the Fate of thofe mighty
Powers. I he Sons of the Ihratian .Family were dedin'd for the glorious Talk ' their opponents of Albu-. ttie nubli
Curitttit. The glowing Sentiments of Liberty are highly animated in the Spteches of old Horatius, and the powerful
Efforts of Love ftruggling m the Bofom of his Daughter Huratia, contraaed to the braveft of the Curtail!, are finely
paurtray'd. HerFrenicy at the Death of her*Lover haftens the Cataftrophe, enfore'd by her bitter Inveaives on her Brother Puilhts, and the Roman Idea of Liberty. The yountSfewnV plunged his Dagger in her Breafl, fully imprefj'd with
^he Rcfohuion that every Feeling and Paffion mutt yieldM the Love and Intercit ot our Country.

On Wednesday Evening, March 16tk, 1803,
Will be acted SOUTHERN'S celebrated and most admired TRAGEDY of

ISABELLA;
T H E FATAL' MARRIAGE.
(Altered by Mr.

GARRICK.)

The power of Southern is the power of nature. Ko author since the days of S/iu&isfltar pow:*ses rosure a clue to all the labyrinths of the Heart j
his language is never tumid nor declamatory, what Is to be spoken at all limes continues the impression, and the charm is unatatinj to the last.
The tragic parts of this play have been always esteemed extremely natural and interesting ; it is built upon the agonies of a mind of keen .enjibihty,
when knowing to have wedded a unnd Huiband while the first was living. The keen distresses of Birmi and liahtltn are powerful appeals to the
Hurt, and work up the feelings of the spectator by irresistible nature.
Of a play, which the wonderful powers of Mrs. SIDDONS have so lately given its utmost force, the recollection of her exquisite performance,
in this particular part, will be the lest eulogy of the author who could thus furnish the scenes best adapted to her talents.

RITES

of the WEIRD

SISTERS.

Our immortal AJthor was never more remarkable foi the dignity of hi. chaiacters, the strength of his expressions, the elevation of his sentiment
and the natural beauty of hi. imagery, than in the production of this excellent piece.
It records a mr.st important point of history, commencing
with the defeat uf that very dangerous Rebel Macdonald, the execution of the Thane of Cawdor, and th. treacherous Prognostic, ot the Witches on
the blasted heath, which afterwards prompt the horrid murder of the Old King by Macbeth and Ins Lady, while a guest at the Castle of Inverness-.
The Assassination of Banquo next takes place, and the appearance of his Ghost at the Royal Banquet. The flight of Macduff to the English Court,
which occasions the slaughter of his Wife and Children at Fife, by otdef of the inhuman tyrant Macbeth, who in the mean time is haunted by the
several Apparitions of A BLOOI?Y CHILD AND EIGHT KINGS; and in conclusion, be.ng blocked up by the English forces, hearing of his
Lady's death, and the equivocating predictions of the Evil Spirits being now fulfilled, in the removal of (Jirnam Wood to Dunsinane High Hill
and encountered per.onallj. by one not bom of a woman—this bloudy prodigy of the North appears abandoned to all the hells of despair and guilt,
..nd justly falls unpided and abhorred.

LOVERS' VOWS;
OR, THE NATURAL SON,
This Play is translated from the German of Kotzebuc, Author of tfie Str.tngcr, Birth-day, Pizano, &c.~The situations of the piece are highly
natural and interesting—The filial affection exemplified in the character of Frederick for his sicl^ and Unfortunate Mother, seldom fails to excite
admiration at the conduct of the Son, and to draw* forth the tear of compassion lor the failings and distress of the Parent. The serious scenes are
happily relieved by the comic, and the whole so judiciously blended, that it forms one of the most pleasing Comedies, and in general gives tfFcat
tatitfaction to the audience.

Will be presented SHAKESPEAXK'S celebrated COMEDY of The

Merchant oS Venice;
OR, THE JEW AND THE CHRISTIAN.
Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,
When learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes
And panting time toil'd after him in vain.
First rear'd the stage, immortal Shakesjieart rose;
His pow'rful strokes presiding truth confes.'d,
Each change of many-colour'd life, he drew,
And unresisted paiiion storm'd the breast. (Dr: Johnson.)
Exhausted Worlds, and then imagined new :
The story of the three caskets of GOLD, SILVER, and L E A D , introduced in this inimitable play, is taken from an old translai,™ of Gtsta
Krmanorum.—Three vessela are exhibited to a Lady, Cor her choice—The first was made of pure Gold, well beset with precious stones withotrt, and
within full of dtad men's bones
Posie, " Whoso ehoostth me shall find That he deseneth."—The second vessel was made of fine Silver, filled with
earth and worms
Posie, " Whttn> chioseth me shall find That his nature desireth."—The third vessel was made of Lead, full of precious stones-—
Po.ic, " Whoso ehmieth me shall find That God hath disposed for him." The Lady,, after a comment upon each, chooses the leaden vessel. (Farmer.)
The other part of the fable of this play, which relates, to the forfeiture of a POUND OF FLESH, may be found in the Pecorone of Ser Giovanni
Fitrentint.
The style of this play is even and easy, with few peculiarities of diction, or anomalies of construction. The comic part raiies laughter,
»-d the serious fixes expectation. The union of two actions in one event is, in this drama, eminently happy. ('Johnson.)

"Will be presented a celebrated PLAY, called The

Point oS Honor.

DUKIMEL, a soldier in the service of France, having been provoked to strike an officer, desetts from his regiment to avoid the punishment which
i w i u s so glaring an infringement of the laws of subordination. He is fortunate enough to procure mercantile employment in the house ol a widow
• tay, on the borders of Switzerland, and an attachment to her daughter B E R T H A , who returns his passion, is in a short time the consequence. Th.f
man.y integrity of the young soldier induces him to discover to the mother the predicament under which he lies; the particulars being overheard by
. disappointed rival, he communicates the circumstance to the officers of the French regiment, at that time quartered in the village. The unfortunate
""H'YS l'" c 0 0 , e ( ! u e n c e apprehended as a deserter. The interest of the drama now commences. Durimel has not seen his father fur many year.,
ino the latter, as a reward for his gallant and meritorious services, had risen from an inferior station in the army to be a major in this very regiment.
He was one of the council who examined the youth, felt himself bound to join in pronouncing sentence of death upon him, and is appointed to give
•he fatal signal. At the moment of the execution, the complicated distress of a parent thus situated must he obvious to every mind: the meeting
oetween father and son (in which they recognise each other) is a scene of affecting and highly-wrought tenderness. The remainder of the play is
_l.iuly occupied in depicting the struggles between a sense of duty and-parental affection, which agitato the breast of the Major, and the distress of
purim.,1, every moment expecting to be summoned by his guards, agonized by the^distraction ol Bertha, and overcome by the deep affliction of his
ather. The bursts of grief and passion naturally flowing from these perplexities, are mixed with occasional sentiments of consolation, fortitude, phiosophy, and religion. The P O I N T OF HONOR is maintained by Durrmel in refusing to escape when in his power, and in resisting the Major'.
ntreaty to avail himself of the favourable opportunity—he will rather die than disgrace his father's character. An awful and solemn military proc.S•..on now takes place for his execution—they proceed to the fatal spot—the handkerchief is bound round his head, and the muskets are levelled at
then object. The father endeavours to give the signal, but his resolution wavers, and he sinks under the agony of his sensations—a thought saddenly
jeeurs to him—he gives the word of command, and instantly rushes before the body of his son. Every one is thrown into the utmost consternation ;
•,he relationship is discovered, and the deserter receives a full Pardon for his offence.

On M O N D A Y , M a y 18,1S4-O,
Will be presented Shakspeare's celebrated and favourite Tragedy of

Prince of Denmark.
Amongst the numberless beauties of the immortal Shakspearc, none rank so preeminently high as this sublime Tragedy. The awful and impressive meeting of
Hamlet with the Ghost of his Father—his determination to obey his injunctions—his
advice to the actors—his soliloquy on death, "To be or not to be, &c."—the sublimity
of the language in the Ghost Scene, where the Ghost appears a second time to warn
Hamlet of his first request,—
" Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught"—

the madness of Ophelia—and, in the fifth act, Hamlet's descanlntion in the Churchyard over the grave of Yorick,—
" Iiuperiotu Caesar, dead and turned to clay, I " Oh that that earth which kept the world in awe,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away : |
Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's ilaw."

In the last Scene, the encounter of Hamlet and Laertes, the death of the treacherous
King, and the final close of the mortal career of the unfortunate Prince of Denmark,
with numerous other beauties, render this Play the first of all dramatic enjoyments.

The New COMEDY, written by G. COL MAN, Esq. Author of the Poor Gentleman,

John Bull,
SL'r

O R A NT

Englishman's Fireside.
T H I S is one of Mr. COLMAN'S happiest Productions. It is a genuine Comedy ; in which the comic is blended
with the serious, and Mirth is enjoyed the more because it is mixed with Distress. The loose Manners of
fashionable Life are exposed with Success, and the Audience are captivated by plain English Virtue. The
Interest is well kept up throughout the whole Piece. The Language is, in general, elegant and correct; the
Mor.tl unexceptionable; and the Sentiments nohle, bold, and impressive. Many of the Situations are interesting, and produce considerable Stage Effect; in short, a better Play has never been witnessed. The Characters, the Story, the Interest of the Piece come Home to our Business and Bosoms—and is truly J O H N
SULL, without any German. Wailing or French Trick.

AMBROSE
IJJWHNITT
OR, A SEA SIDE STORY!
This i« one of the best Drama*, the minor Stage has produced for some time and has the rare merit, in theie
translating times, of being purely English from "Top to Toe." The language is unaffected, foreibl., and appropriate, the characters are dearly and pleasingly drtwn, the incidents follow <>acb other naturally and Dramatically. and the plot is managed with a degree of ease and skill, not usually n anifested in productions of thin
grade. The interest is extremely well s tistained throughout. P iy and suspense are alternately excited and unmixed satisfaction attends the denomtient.

of

The Managers having been applied to by a very respectable party to give one more representation of the
popular Drama of T H E JFE W E S S , the public are respectfully informed that this very favourite Play
will be performed on this Evening, being most positively the Last Night of its representation in Winchester,

On Friday Evening Next, July 29, 1836,
Will be pre.ented the admired Tragedy of

GEORGE
BARNWELL.
Thij play has for many years been acknowledged the mo.t useful example to youth of all rank that ever was given to the world
in a dramatic habit. The unhappy hero is a young gentleman sent from the country, and put apprentice to an eminent merchant.
You first behold him in possession of as many virtues as human nature can be capable of receiving, till becoming acquainted with
a vile prostitute, he is by her seduced from his innocence, tempted to break his trust, rob his honoured master of considerable sums
of money, and at length (10 support her extravagancies) persuaded to murder his venerable Uncle, as be was reading in a grove
near his house. Struck, however, with the greatness of his crime, he flies for shelter, without being hardened enough to add to
his guilt by taking that wealth which she so earnestly expected. Disappointed in her views of plunder, this monster sends for the
ufficers of justice, has him seized, and becomes his accuser for the crime which she herself contrived, and even obliged liim to
commit. Here the justice of Heaven is more conspicuously discoverable in causing the wretch herself to be taken up (notwithstanding her art in becoming the first accuser), and tried and executed as an accomplice. The fifth act discovers the unhappy
youth in one of the Cells of Newgate, chained and prepared for his unhappy fate, his friends weeping around him, and with that
tranquillity which nothing but true penitence can give, he is led to the fatal tree a victim to public justice, yet an object from whom
the eye of humanity cannot withhold the tear of pity.

Will take place on MONDAY; EVENING, August 1,1836,
On which occasion will be performed, the admired Melo Drama called The

SOMNAMBULIST
Or, THE PHANTOM OF THE VILLAGE!!

Thii Piece is founded upon the celebrated Ballet LA SOMNA MBULE or M, M. Scribe and Aumer, which, on it« first production at the Theatres in Paris, n much engrossed the attention of t h r
trench Critics. Its reception in the English Metropolis has been equally fortunate. The story of the Piece is at once simple and touching. A young Tillage maiden, on the eve of her marriage, and who
i. (we may My) afflicted with SOMNAMBULISM, is found in a stranger's room at Midnight! Everything fails to convince her lover of her innocence, till he himself witnesses what be had btfor,
considered a delusion. Ernestine having retired to repose in despair for the rejection ihe has met with, is seen to

Recollection seems to aid her—she returns—advances to her friends—and, still sleeping, is made happy by her lover's hand joined with her own, and instead of awakening to Misery and a horrible Death,

THE MOST

TRIUMPHANT

SUCCESS,

At the time of the action the Plague is supposed to be raging throughout Argos j and in the working out of a prophecy, impending over the King and hi. rat-.,
this most exquisite play has found birth. It would be arrogant to select any portion of it as the mark of particular panegyric; yet the reply of Ion to Clemanthe,
when .he deprecates his exposing himself to danger by mixing with the plague-stricken, " i n whose aid even he can do but little," may be fairly extract*-, a. a
specimen of the beauty of the poetry.
It 15 little-.
But in these sharp eitremitie. of fortune,
[lie blessings winch (lie weak and poor ran scatter
Have tlicir own season. ' , ' . , a little thing
T o give a cup of water; yet us draught
Of ci ol retrcsliinent, dram'd by leveed lips.
May gi"> a shock Of pleasure to the frame

More exquisite than when nectarean j n i r ,
With gentle tears ; relai the knotted hand.
Henew. the life of joy in huppiest hours.
To know the bonds of fellowship again,
It is a little thing to speak a phrase
And shed on the departing soul a sense
Of common comfort which, by daily use,
*
More precious than the benison of friends
Has almost lost its sense ; yet on the ear
About the lionor'd death-bed of the rich,
Of him who thought to die tnnnourn'd 'twill full
To him who else were lonely, that another
Of the great laniily ia near and feels,"
Like choicest music; fill the plating eye
