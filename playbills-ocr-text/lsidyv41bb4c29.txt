HORSE of KNOWLEDGE.
T is impoffible for the most elaborate description to form an adequate idea of this furprizing animal : In him the power of instinct is fo extremely striking, that it feems Superior to ieafon in many instances., T o mention all the performances of this wonderful
creature would exceed the compafs of this bill, and to many might have the appearance of
romance; but the curious may form fome judgement from Ae following paruculars :—He
cither fetches or carries at the word of command, he fhews his knowledge in Several forts
of numbers, and finds out any one perfon in the room from another. He tells by any
common watch the time of the day or night to a mmute ; tho feveral peop.e fhould lay
down different nieces of money, he tells the value of each piece, and afterwards gtves each
p e X n h s own rV.ece that was borrowed while he was blindfolded , and tf different people
drawdiflere«
cards out of a pack while he is blindfolded, he will tell how many fpots
there is unon each of them. And particularly, if told he must go mto Flanders, and fight
•'or anv other king he makes himfelf lame in a Surprizing manner, and will bear feveral
f t r o l e L t h o u t a l f e r i n g his position; but w h « told .heThall fightTor king Gear*, or the
company, he fprings up with all the alacrity imaginable.--And
does other wonderfu.
p e Z m a n c e s too tedious to mention
He very agreeably entertains the company
with feveral Surprizing performances that never was done by any Horfe before.

H I S most aftoniihing Part of the Human Species was born in the [(land
of Corjica, on the Mountain Stata Ota, in the Year 1743. She is only
Thirty-four Inches hi^h, weighs but Twenty-fix Pounds, and a Child of two
Years old has iarger Hands and Feet. Her furprizing Littlenefs makes a finking Impreffipn, at first Sight, on the Spectator's Mind ; nothing dfatreeable
either in Perkn or Converfation, is to be found in her, altho' most of Nature's
Productions in Miniature, are generally deficient in both. Her Form affords a
pleasing Surprize, and her admirable Symmetry engages the Attention. She is
polTeflcd of a .;reat deal of Vivacity and Spirit; can .peak Italian and French,
and gives the inquifilive Mind an agreeable Entertainment. In ih'.rt, She i<; the
moft extraordinary Curlofity ever known, or even heard of in Hift.ry ; and the
curious in ail Countries where (he has been fhewn, pronounce her to be the
fiaeft DHp.ay of Human Nature in Miniature thev ever faw.

She is to be Seen by any Number of Perfons, from Ten in the Morning 'till Nine at Night.
