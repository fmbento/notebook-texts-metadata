New Theatre Royal,
Such parts cf (he design for the re-building tbe Interior of this Theatre, and which the shortness of the time prevented from being entirely completed last year, have been accomplished, by many additional Comforts, and superb Addenda to the Decorations.
The additional Comforts consist in the opening of several
Commodious Family Boxes,
In the First Circle, similar to those which were so much patronized last year in the Dress Circle— Additional ACCOMMODATION in the Upper Circle op Boxes.
A new second-price Waiting-Room to the Pit.
A more spacious and convenient Staircase has been adapted to the Upper Gallery, the Arch ©f which has beea extended, so as to unite much better with the Ceiling, and at the same time to afford a much more extensive View of the Stage—Another commodious Seat has been added to the Lower Gallery. With regard to the Decorations of the Auditory, the Ceiling has been completed by the introduction of the Foliage Ornaments in the Pannels of the Centre aud Cove. The Pilasters over the open Gold Columns of the Proscenium have received their Scroll Ornaments, and the Base of the Proscenium has been covered with one mass of Sanded Gold, and this has been carried completely round the House, so as to forma solid plinth of Gold to the whole of the Auditory.
Two new & highly finished DROP SCENES
Have been painted—one, an Architectural Paysage, inclosed in a gold frame, is tbe joint production of Madinari and Stanfield, and the other a Landscape, partly a composition from the Acropolis, in which is introduced the Parthenon, together with the Coliseum, the Aichof Adrian, and other celebrated Buildings of Antiquity, by Stanfield.	■■■• >*
In the Mechanic Department, -the Stage has been rendered much more practicable—the timber supports lnve been replaced with Cast Iron Columns, and the Float widened so as to admit the operation of Medium?, that will communicate the different Tints of the Seasons, and of the rising and setting Sun on the Scenery. The whole of the Auditory will be illuminated by
A new CENTRAL, LUSTRE,
Upon an entirely novel Plan, and by
Tiro Rows of Christal Chandeliers
Of Wax Candles, which, as a Light, arc considered more adapted to the comfort and health, as well as corn!' sive to the belter appearance of the Audience than the Gas. The compact fdrm of the house, which was acknowledged last year to have united so much comfort with elegance, and a perfect and easy possibility of hearing, with a complete view of the Stage, remains unaltered.
THE SALOON
Has been fitted up in a style of unequalled splendbur.
The Superb Plates of French Glass
of last year still remain, but they are now enclosed by Pilasters and Columns, and surmounted by rich gilded and decorated Draperies, with two models finely executed of tbe Royal Arm-.—The Draperies arc painted by Roberts, assisted by Kelly, Hollogan and other artists, and the Marbling done • y Messrs. F. and H.Crace, by whom the whole of the magnificent decorations of the Theatre have been executed.
C3* The Central Lustre and Chandeliers constructed by Mr. Collins.
The whole of the splendid Brass Work of the Theatre by Messrs. Johnston and Brookes.

'Lignum Vit.*, the great Eastern Machinist, haring constructed a Chest that will transport its -occupants to any desired place, resigns himself to repose—He is, bower ci disturbed by the information, that the Princess Schirine still pines a solitary prisoner in the Castle op One Hundred Gates, built for her father, the Sultan of Gasrta, by the magic arts of the Aft tie Niger, who loving Schirinc, had rendered it inaccessible purposely to elude (be threat of her Horoscope, that predicted her marriage ■with a man of ruined fottunes. To thwart these plans, Lignum Vitas directs Maltk, the youth designed by the prediction, to enter the Flying Chest, and attempt the litieration of the Princess. The Chest then being stored with various phosphoric and destructive missiles, in case of an encounter, rapidly cleaves the air, and alights on the Terrace of the Palace, w liich Malek and his attendant, Qtterro, enter on the departure of the Sultan and train.—Schirine, delighted at the tight of her lover, is about to c-cape with him •wheiTthe alarm is sounded by her Goverumte, and the Sultan and his Vixier rusli in, and bear off the Princess. Malek and Querco enter the Chest, and mount the air, in pursuit of the ravisliers whom they •overtake crossing a bridge.—Malek from the Chest pours down his missiles, which create such confusion, •that the bridge breaks and precipitates the vanquished into the river—The triumphant Malek then alights, and is bearing away the Princess, when the Afrite Niger appears, and tires the Che«t, but Lignum Vilee rising from its centre, extinguishes the,flames,and promises the lovers protection—Niger, causing the Chest to disappear, declare.-« none hut its possessor can gain the baud of the Princess; but Lignum Vitae informs them, though hindered by bis enemy’s spells from disclosing the exact spot of its concealment, lie can considerably aid them in their search—He then transform- them into Harlequin .and Columbine, whilst Niger changes Sultan and Vizier into Pantaloon a.ul Clown. The usual pantomimical contest then commences, and continues till the Flying Chest being found, the
Jieceterminates with the Nuptials of Harlequin and Columgine in the Paradise of Zephyr and
