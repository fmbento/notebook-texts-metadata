old Gentleman, Harlequin gets into his Gown, Wig, fee. and the Lawyer disappears \—in this
Disguise he enters the House, is perceived, and m.kes his Kscape up through the Ceiling, in
a most astonishing Manner;—the Clown is leSt, with a CANDLE burning, which alternately

L'ghtning $ the Vessel goes to the Bottom, and one of the Crew clings to a Mast, by Aid of
which he gets to Shore j is going to hang himself on the withered Branch of an old Oak,
which breaks, the Trunk opens, and a FAIRY appears, converts the melancholy Sailor into
the gay fantastic HARLEQUIN, who receives his magical Sword from the ANIMATED
SERPENT, which traverses the Stage, and is generally allowed to be a very ingenious
Piece of Mechanism.
__^_ OT .._ > ___
SCENE If.
A VILLAGE,—Pantaloon and Colombine conducted home bjr the Clown,

JrVdcs ascend to the Clouds.—The Lover and his Servant appear, and are received with Extacy
by Pantaloon j—he sends fcr a Lawyer, to draw up Marriage Articles j—as he4i following the
old Gentleman, H.trlequin gets into bis Gown, Wig, &c, and the Lawyer disappears |—in this
Disguise he caters the House, is perceived, and makes his Escape up through the Ceiling, in
• most astonishing Manners—the Clown is left, with a CANDLE burning, which alternately
changes to THREE CANDLES, and from THREE to ONE.—Harlequin is pursued by
Pantaloon, and jumps over T E N MEN, forward and backward j—they seize him, put him
into a Sack, and when they thsnk he t> ..seurcly there, they find his Dresi only.

Waggoner's Head, sets it on a Table,—tf,e HEAD, in a most wonderful and incredible
Manner, Smoaks, Drinks, &c &c.—The Punch Bowl changes to a DOG, he atracks ike

DOG KENNEL, where being perceived, ke instantly changes it to an elevated PIGEON
HOUSE, and from that to a PRISON, in which the Lover and Pantaloon are confined.—
Harlequin takes the Advantage, and with Colombine goes to an Ordinary, to regale,—He is
pursued, jumps through a Window, and leaves all in Confusion, having occasioned " a grest
Clatter among the Moveables."—Colombine, for Obstinacy, is thrown into the

Cavern of Vice;
From which she is conveyed, by the Power of Enchantment, to the most magnificent Scentthat Imagination can fancy—

....

SCENE 1.
T H E oniy Daughter uf a %.uu.h Governor of an American (Sittlfmeaij,
being for Some Years privately married (without the Approbation of her Father, to a young
Officer then employed in the Wars , and, the Woe of her concealed Engagement, a young and
beauteous Boy, fecrered with uncommon Caution, in the Houfe of her Father) is feriouity en*
treaced to accept, as a Hufband, a young Gentleman chofen by htr Parent, whofc Addreffe.}
Ihe endeavours to evade, and at last openly rejects, in Defiance of her Father'ssternAuthority.—
Oh the Governor's Departure, the Child is produced from the Suca^Er REPOSITORY, which his
anxious Mother had invented, with, curious Carts, to preferve his Life, and conceal her own Situation.—On an Alarm of hafty Footsteps, the Child retires to the MAGIC CABINET, which
had hitherto eluded the vigilant Curiofity of the enraged Governor j but, in carelefs Hafte, neglects locking a Drawer, wherein certain Letters are depoSited, which might lead to a DiScovery
of his Mother's Situation.—By the mere Effect of Accident, the Signal is given, which draw*
the inadveitent and ardefs Infant from his Place of appointed Concealment.—The frantic Governor dilcovers him to be the Son of his offending Daughter, and dragging forth the helplefs
Victim, cruelly refolves to offer the unoffending Innocent as a Sacrifice at the Shrine of his
Mother's Difobedience.—The cautious Ingenuity, anxious Affection, and maternal TfnderneSs,
difplayed in the Management of this interesting Scene, is truly natural, donitftic, and affecting.
SCENE II.
A wild and winding romantic mountainous PROSPECT.—The Habitation
and ReSidence of an outlawed Banditti, or Party of difaffectcd Indians and Spaniards, who are
difcovered in (baring their Plunder, and boafting of their barbarous Exploits.—When the
Robbers retire to their Cavern, the Servants of the implacable Governor, employed to aflaffinate
the Child, enter with their little devoted Victim, whole Fate feems Sufpended, till the Ruffians
have agreed upon the Manner of his Death.—The Providential Interftience and Humanity of
the Captain of the Outlaws refcues the Child from the uplifted Weapon of the abandoned
Hireling, and the grateful Boy repays his Deliverer with all the endearing Tendernefc of infant
Affection.—The Robber introduces the Child to the Banditti, who receive him with Kindnefe
,-u.d Attention, and he retires with them to their Cave.
SCENE. III.
The diftrafted and wandering Mother, in Search of her loft Infant, is attacked
in the Wood by two of the ("haggling Banditti, and releaSed from their Brutality, by theh brave
and generous Captain.—In this trying Situation the unexpcSedly meets the Objeft of her Sorrow—her beloved Infant, whom the Captain, with much Feeling and Regret, ftiffers to depart
with her.—In the Inftant of their joyful Congratulations, they are agsm Surprized by the Governor and his AlTaffins, whofe horrid PurpoSes ate defeated by the C ...id's* PofieiTion of the
Means and Manner of giving the Signal for the Affcmblage of the Robbers; who now ruth on,
and protect the Lady and her Child, and purfue, with unabating Fury, the Governor and his
Ruffians.
SCENE IV. &?*. EcV. tiff.
The accidental Meeting of the Father with his Child.—The Alarm of the
fc«utingIndians—his gallant Defence, and manly Retreat—the Terror and Trepidation of the
unoffending Infant—the Prefence of Mind and Intrepidity of a IVmale BUtk Attendant—
with the animating and'joyful Reconciliation of all Parties, form the principal Incidents of
this ingenious and well conceived Ballet j to which appropriate Scrm-ry, new Mufic, and correspondent Decorations, arc accurately annexed.

Officer then employed in the Wars j and, the IITue of her concealed Engagement, a young and
beauteous Boy, Secreted with uncommon Caution, in the HouSe of her Fathei) w ftnoufly entreated to accept, as a Hufband, a young Gentleman thofen by her Parent, whofe AiklrelTes
the endeavours to evade, and at laft.'pcnly rejects, in Defiance of her Father's Hern Authority.—
On the Governor's Departure, the Child is produced from the SECRET R I U W I T O R Y , which his
anxious Mother had invented, with curious Care, to preferve his Life, and conceal her own S4tuation. — On an Alaitft of hafty Footfteps, the Child retires to the MAGIC C A B I N E T , which
had hitherto eluded the vigilant Curiofity of the enraged Governor •, but, in clrekfi 11 ..fie, neglects locking a Drawer, wherein certain Letters are deposited, which might lead to a Difcovery
of his Mother's Situation.—By the mere Effect of Accident, the Sigflal is given, which draws
the inadvertent and artleSs Infant from his Place of appointed Concealment.—The frantic Governor difcovers him to be the Son of his offending Daughter, and dragging forth the helplefs
Victim, cruelly refolves to offer the unoffending Innocent as a Sacrifice at the Shrine oS his
Mother's Difobedience.—The cautions Ingenuity, anxious Affection, and maternal TcnderneSs,

have agreed upon the Manner of his Death.—The Providential Interference and Humanity of
the Captain of the Outlaws refcues the Child from the uplifted Weapon of the abandoned

BALLAD

on which the Pantomime of

Alonzo & Imogine,
IS F O U N D E D .

.s*a.(fe

A

WARRIOR fa bold, and a virgin fo bright
Converfed, as they fat on the green ;
They gazed on each other with tender delight;
Alonzo the Brave was the name of the knight,
The maid's was the Fair Imogine.

" And, oh !" faid the vouth, " Since to-morrow I go
T o fight in a far diftant land,
Your tears for my abfence foon leaving to flow,
Some other will court you, and you will bellow
On a wealthier fuitor your hand."
" O h ! huSh thefe Suspicions," Fair Imogine laid.
" OflFeiiiive to love and to me 1
For, if you be living, or if you be dead,
I Swear by the Virgin, that none in your Head
Shall hufb.ind of Imogine be,
" If < *er I. by lull: or by wealth led afide,
Forget my Alonzo the B r w ,
God grant, that to puniSh my falfehood and pride
Your ghoft at the marriage may fit by my fide,
May tax me with p* ijuiy, claim trie as bride,
And bear me away to the grave !"
T o Palestine haftened the hero So bold •
His love, flic lamented him Sore :
But. Scarce had a twelvemonth elapfed, when behold,
A Baron all covered with jewels and gold
Ai rived at Fait Imogine'sdoor.
His feaSurc, his prefents, his Spacious domain
Soon made her untrue to her vows:
He dazzled het eyes ; he bewildered her brain;
He caught her ..ffechons So light and So vain,
And carried her home as his SpouSe.
And now had the marriage been bleft by the priest:;
The revelry now was begun:
The tables they groaned with the weight oS the Scaft;
Nor yet had the laughter and merriment ceaSed,
When the bell at the caftle told—" one !"
I hen fitft with amazement Fair Imogine found
That a Stranger was placed by her fide :
His aii was terrific; he uttered no found j
He Spoke not, he moved not, he looked not around,
But earnestly gazed on the bride.
His vizor was cloSed, and gigantic his height;
Hit armour was fable to view :
All pltafurc and laughter were hulbed at his fight;
1 he dogs as they eyed him drew back in affiight,
1 he lights in tl e chamber burned blue 1

_..

His preSence all boSoms appeared rodifmay;
The guefts fat in Silence and fear.
At length fpoke the bride, while (lie trembled j " I pray
Sir Knight, that your helmet afi le y ,o would lay,
And deign to partake of our chear."
The lady is filent : the Stranger r m lies,
H k vizor he Slowly unclofed ;
Oh 1 God 1 what a fight met Fair Imogine's eyes I
What words can expicfs Her dlfmay an I fu.priSc,
When a Skeleton's head was expoled 1
All preSent then uttered a terrified fiSout;
All turned with difguftfiom the Scene.
The worms they ciept in, and the worms they crept oit*,
And Sported his eyes and his temples about,
While the Spectre addrcfled lmogine.
" Behold me, thou falSe one 1 behold me 1" he cried,
" Remember AlonzT. the Brave!
God grains, (hat to punHh thy falfehood and pride
My ghost at thy marriage fhould fir I y thy Side,
Should tax thee with penury, claim tliee as bride,
And bear thee away to the grave !"
Thus Saving, his arms round the lady he wound,
While loudly fire Shrieked in dilinay r
Then fank with his prey through the wide-yawn.
ground:
Nor ever agait. was Fair Imagine found,
Or the fpeftre who bore her away.
Not long lived the Baron; and none Since that time
T o inhabit the caftle prefume,
For chronicles tell that, by order Sublime,
There Imogine Suffers the pain of her crime,
And mourns her deplorable doom.
At midnight four times in each year does her fprighr,
When mortals in Slumber are bound,
Arrayed in her bridal apparel of white,
Appear in the hall with the Skeleton-Knight,
And Shriek as he whirls her around.
While they drink out of Skulls newly torn from du
grave,
Dancing round diem the Spectres are Seen :
Tlvir liquor is bio >d, and this horrible (lave
1 hey howl: - " l o the health of Alonzo the Brave,
And his confort, the Falfc Imogine 1"

In adopting the above for Dramatic Representation, Mr. DIBDIN* has varied
from the Ballad in Some Situations and entirely altered the Cataftrophe.

BALLAD

on which the Pantomime of

Alonzo & Imogine,
IS F O U N D E D .

"'»•;.-'-?-•

A W A R R I O R fo bold, and a virgin fo bright
Converted, as they fat on the green ;
They gazed on each other with tender delight;
Alonzo the Brave Wat the name of the knight,
The maid's was the Fair Imogine.
" And. oh !" fik! the votith, " Since to-morrow I go
T o Agftt in a f»i diftant find,
ToUf teats for my abfence loon ."caving to flow,
Some other will court you, and you will bellowOn • wealthier fuitor your h a r d . "
" O h ! bulb theft f'ufpicions," Fair Imogine Said,
" OfFcnfive to b f e and to me !
For, if you be livirtg, or if you be dead,
I fWar.by the Virgin, that none in your Stead
Shall huibsnd of Imogine be.
" If e'er I, by lull or by wealth led afide,
Forget my Alonzo the Brave,
God grant, that to junifh my falfihood and pride
Youi ghost at the marriage may Sit by my Side,
May tax me with perjury, claim me as bride,
And bear me away to the grave !'*
T o Pair (fine hastened the hero fo bold;
H s love, (be lamented him (ore :
But Scarce had a twelvemonth elapfed, when behold,
A Baron all covered with jewels and gold
Airived at Fair Imoguw's door.
His treafure, his prcfentt, his Spacious domain
Soar) madeher untrue to her v o w s ;
H e dazzled hiei eyes ; he bewildered her brain,
H e caught her affections fo light and So vain, •
And tarried her home as his SpouSe.
And now had the" marriage been bleft by the priefr ;
t h e rtvef v now was be<2tirt ;
T h e tables they groaned with the weight oS the Seaft,
N o r yet had the laughter and merriment ceaSed,
When the bell at the caftle t o l d — " one !"
Then first with amazement Fair Imogine Sound
That a ftrangei was plated by her Side :
H i s air was terrific ; he uttered no found ;
H e Spolu* not, he moved not, he looked not around.
But earnestly gazed on the bride.
H i s vuor was cloSed. and gigantic his height;
1 lis armour was fable to view:
All p't tl'.'e and laughter were hufhed at his fight,
I he dogs as they eyed him drew back in affright j
T h e lights in the chamber burned blue 1

m

His prcfence all boSoms appeared rodiSmay;
T h e quells fat in Silence and fear.
At length (poke the bride, while (be trembled; " I pray,
Sir Knight, that your helmet afule you would lay,
And deign to partake of our chcar."
T h e lady is filent : the stranger complies,
1 Ti, vizor he (lowly unclofed ,
Oh ! &»d ! what a fight met Fair Imogine's eyes I
W h a t words can exprefs herdifmay and furprife,
When a (keleton's head was expofed I
All prefent then uttered a terrified fhout;
All turned with difguft fiom the fcene.
T h e worms they crept in, and the worms they crept out.
And (ported his eyes and his temples about,
While the fpectre addreffed Imogine.
" Behold me, thou falfe one! behold m e ! " he cried,
" Remember Alonzo the Brave !
God grants, that to punifh thy falSehood and pride
My ghost at thy imtriage mould fit by thy fide,
Should tax thee with perjury, claim thee as bride,
And bear thee away to the grave !"
T h u s Saying, his arms round the lady he wound,
While loudly fhe fhrieked in difutay ;
Then fank with his prey through the wide-yawning
ground:
N o r everagain was Fair Imogine found,
O r the fpectre who bore her away.
Not long lived the Baron j and none Since that time
T o inhabit the caftle prefume,
For chronicles tell that, by order fublime,
There Imogine Suffers the pain of her crime,
And mourns her deplorable doom.
At midnight Sour times in each year does her (bright,
W h e n mortals in (lumber are bound,
Arrayed in her bridal apparel of white,
Appear in the lull with the Skeleton-Knight,
And (brick as he whirls her around.
"While they drink out of fkulls newly torn from the
grave,
Dancing round them the Spectres are Seen :
Their licjuor is blood, and this horrible (lave
They b o w ] : — " ] o the health of Alonzo the Brave,
And his confort, the Falfe linogine 1"

In adopting the above for Dramatic Representation, Mr. DIBDIN has varied
from the Ballad in Some Situations, and entirely altered the Cataftrophe.

BALLAD

on which the Pantomime of

Alonzo & Imogine,
IS FOUNDLD.

A

WARRIOR fo bold, and a virgin fo bright
Converted, as they fat on die green
-,
. They gazed on each other with tender delight;
Alonzo the Brave was the name of the knight,
The maid's was the Fair Imogine.

" And, oh !" faid the voutli, " Since to-morrow I go
To fight in a far diftant find,
Your tears (or my abfence fojn leaving toflo\.,
Some other will court you, and yon will bellow
On a wealthier Suitor your hand."
** O h ! hufh thefe fufpicions," FairItnogine Said,
" Offenfive to love and to nic !
For, if you be living, Or if you be dead,
I fwcar by the Virgin, that none 11
:»ad
Shall hufband si Irnogfhe be.

X Toe lady is ftlerit : the Stranger Complies;
X His vizor IK flowly unclofcd,
$ Oh 1 God ! what a fight met. Fair Imo'gine's eyes!
H What words can expttfs herdifmay and SurpriSe,
When a .kekton's head was expofed

\ All pr.-fent then uttered a terriff d fh
h All turned wuhrhf ui'
\ The wo-mtirhey cicpi in
th
they .
And fpotted his eyes and li > t.< \\ plj , about.
While the lpec\re ad Ireflfcd Imoa
" Behold me, thou Salfe one 1 behold me I" he ci ied
" Remember Alonzo rhe Brave !
God grants, that to punifli thy falfehood and pride
My ghoff at thy mat riage flv.uld fit! ,y thy |
Should tax thee wjth perjury, claim thee as Bride,
And bear thee away to the grave !"

To Paleftine (.aliened the hero fo bold ,
His love, fhe lamented him fore :
But farce had a twelvemonth elapled, when behold,
A Baron all covered with jewels and gold
ArrT<-d fit Fair I mop

Thus fayinp, his arms round the la
While loudly fhc fb.ru.ked in dil
Then lank with his prey throng!

Then first with amazement Fair Imogine Sound

THf? PANTOMISI.CAL DRAMA OF

T o illustrate the Mysteries of OBl, and the Character and Exploits of T H R E E FINGER'D JACK, the Work above-mentioned ha* furnilhcd the folfovving EXTRACTS:
" The Science of Ob! is vety extenfive—This Obi, or as it, is pronounced in the Englifh Weft
Indies, Obeah, has its origin, like many cuftoms among the Africans, from the ancient /Egyptians Obi,
forthe purpofe of bewitching People, or co-fuming them by lingering ilkiefs, is made of Grave Dirt,
Hair, Teeth of Sharks, and other animals*-Blood, Feathers, Egg-fli'lls, Images in Wax, the Hearts
of Birds, Liver of Mice, and Some intent Roots, Weed,, and Buihes, of which Europeans arc at this
time ignorant.—rA Negro, who thinks himfelf bewicci.'d by Obi, will apply to an Obi Man or Ol/i Woman for cure. The mod wrinkled and most deformed Obian Magicians are the mo ft venerated.*'
Speaking of an horrible clafsof Negroes, the Author of the Work alluded to lays, " lame ofthefe
abandoned Exiles live ki Spire of the common Law of Nature, and fUrvive a general Mmat.on of tFtetr
Mufcles, Ligaments, and Osteology, becoming tvlfo ...deonfty white in their woolly Hair antj Skin."
** In then Banifhment, their Huts often become the Receptacles of Rubbers and fugitive Negroes. Thus, thefcuglv loathfomc Creatures arc Oracles of W'oods, Caves, and unfrequented Places,
and are reforted to fecretly, by the wretched iri Mind, and by the MaljcioUs for Wicked I'uipofes."

THREE FINGER'D JACK,
The learned Author of the Work we have profited by, fays,—
* J faw the Obi of the famoiib Negro Robber, Three Finger'd Jack, the Tenor of Jamaica, in
1780.
' It confifted of a Goat's Horn filled with a Compound of Grave Dir;, Allies, the Blood of a
black Cat, and Human F a , all mk'd into a Kind of Paite, A Cat's Foot, a dried T jad, a Pie's Tail,
a Slip of Virginal Parchment of Kid Skin, with Characters mark'd in Blood on it, were alio In his Obian Bag. Thefe, with i keen Sttbre, and two Guns, were all his Obi j with which, and his Courage in
defending into the Plains, and plundering to Supply his Wants, and his Skill in retreating into difficult
Faftneflcjs, among the Mountains, commanding the only Aee«£. ro them, where none dated to follow
him, he terrified the I-ihaciunts, and fet the Civil Power and the Neighbouring Militia of the Ifland at
Defiance for near two Years.
* He had neicher Accomplice nor Affot late. There were a few runaway Negroes in the Wboffs
near Mount Lebanus, like Place of his Retreat, but he had crofs'd their Foreheads with forhc of tfte
Magic in his-Ho.n,and they could not betray hirn. But he trusted no one—he foamed Afliftance. He
aitended above Spai tacus—he robb'dalune—fought all his Rattles alone—and always killed his Pui Suers.
By his Magic, he was not. only the Dr:ad of rhe Negroes, but there weie many While People who believed he was poffeffed of lome Supernatural Power,
• At length, allured bv the Rewards offered by Governor Dalling, two Negroes named Quafbet arc!
Sam, both of Scot's Hall, Maroon Town, went in Search oS him—Quafiee before heftr out on the Expedition, got himfelf chriftencd, ahd Changed his Name vo James Reeder. They took with them a little
Boy. 1 hel't three foondifcovsr'dby ImprctTions among the Weeds and Bullies, that Some Perlon mull

* They came upon 'feck before he perceived them—-be was roafting Plamains by a little Fire on the
Ground, at the Mouth of a Cave, Jack's looks were fierce and terrible; He told them he would kill
them.
* Reeder replied that his Obi hat! no Power to hurt him j for he was chrifkned, and that his Name
was no longer ^uajhee.
' Jack knew Reeder, and, as if paralyfed, he let his two Guns remain on th * Ground, and took up

the Head of the Cave.

' Here was a Stage, on which two of the ftoutelt Hearts, that were ever hooped with ribs, bc»an

Obi, or Three Finger d Jack,
Is founded on a Matter of Fact, which occurred (An. Dom. 17Bo) in
the Ifland of JAMAICA ;
/hid is related in a learned and ingenious Work, lately pui'Mid, " Mafdef s freatife on Sugar, and
Medical Obfervaiions"

T o illustrate the Myderies of OBI. and the Character and Exploits of T H R E E FINGER'D JACK, the Work above-mentioned has furnifhed the following EXTRACTS:
" The Science of Obi is very extenfive—This Obi, or as it is pronounced in the Englifh Weil
Indies, Obeab, has its origin, like many ci.fr.oms among the Africans, from the anient ^Egyptians Obi,
for the purpofe of bewitching People, or confuming then, bv lingering illnefs, is made of Grave Dire,
Hair, Teeth of Shaiks, and other animals—Blood, f edicts, Lgg-meiis, Images in Wax, the Hearts
of Birds, Liver of Mice, and fome potent Roots, Weeds, and Bufhcs, of which Europeans are at this
time ignorant.—A Negro, who thinks himfelf bewitch'd by Obi, will apply to an Obi Man or Obi Woman for cure. The mod wrinkled and moil deformed Obian Magicians are the mod venerated."
Speaking of an horrible clafs of IStegroef, the Author of the Work alluded to fay5-. " fome of thefe
abandoned Exiles live in Spite of the Common Law of Nature, and Survive a general Mutation of their
Mufcles, Ligaments, and Oftrology; becoming alio hideoufly white in their woolly Hair and Skin."
" In their Banilbment, their Huts often become the Receptacles ».f Robbers and fugitive Negroes. Thus, tlicfe ugh lo.uhfot.nr Creatures are Ocacles oS Woods, Caves, and nnfrequented 1".
and are retorted to fecrctly, by the wrttched'in Mind, and by the Malicious for wicked Purposes."

THREE FINGER!) JACK,
The learned Author of the Work we have profited by, Says,—
• I law the Obi of the famous Negro Robber, Three i'inger'd Jack, the Tenor of Jamaica, in
1780.
' It confifted of a Goat's Horn filled with a Compound of Grave Dirt, Afhes, the Blood of a
black Cat, and Human Fat, all mix'd into a Kind 6f Pade , A Cat's Fool, a dried Toad, a Pig's Tail,
a Slip of Virginal Parchment of Kid Skin, with Characters mark d in Blood on it, were ailo in his Obian Bag. Thefe, with a keen Sabre, and two Guns, were all Ms Obi; widi which, and his Courage in
defcending into the Plains, and plundering to Supply his Wants, and his Skill in retreating into difficult
Fadneiles, among the Mountains, commanding the only Accef, to them, where nor£ dared to follow
him, he terrified the Inhabitants, and fet the Civil Power and the Neighbouring Militia of the Ifland at
Defiance for near two Years.
*
' He had neither Accomplice nor AiTociate. There were a few runaway Negroes in the Woods
near Mount Lebanus, the Place of his Retreat, but he had crois'd theit Foreheads with Some of the
Ma |tc in his } lorn, ind they could n
But he traded no one
ned Afliffaace. 1 fe
afcemaed abvu^i-Sparta u
•—wpght all his Battles alone—and always killed his FarSuerf.
By hi
, he was not only the Dread of the Negroes, but there were many While People who be
lieved he v/a poffefit I ot lour: fupernatura! Powei.
' At length, allured by the Rewards offered by Governor Dalling, two '
1 ained Quajhee and
Sam, both of Si ot's I (all, Maroob Town, went in Search of him—*Quafljee before he let out on tl
dition, t
II ehriftened, and changed his Name to James Reeder. They
h them a little
Boy. 1 li -ie •
I dileover'd by In.preff.ons among the Weeds and Bufhes, thai lome Petfon mufl
have lately been that Way. They Softly follow'd thefe Imprelfions, making not the lead Noile.—Pie(cntly they difcovered a Smoke.
' They came upon Jack before he perceived them—he was roading Plantains by a little Fire on the
Ground, at the Mouth of a Cave. Jack's looks were fierce and terrible j He told them he would kill
them.
• Reeder replied that his Obi had no Power to hurt him, for he was chriflened, and that his Name
was no longer Qua/hee,
' Jack knew Reedir, and, as if paraJyfed, he let his two Guns remain on the Ground, and took up
only hisCutlafs.
' Thefe two had a fevereEngagement Several Years before, in the Woods, in which Conflict Jack
Jod the two Fingers, which was the Origin of his prefent Name.
* Without further parley, Jack, with hisCutlafs in his Hand, threw himfclf down a Precipice at
the Head of tit* Cave.
.' Reeder'j Gunmifs'd Fire—Sam fliat bim in the Shoulder—-Recder, like an Englifh Bull Dog, never
looked, but with his Cutlafs in his Hand, plunged headlong down after Joti*
1
Here was a Stage, on which two of the domed Hearts, that were ever hooped witli ribs began
their bloody druggie.
' The little Boy, who was order'd to keep back cut of Harm's Way, now icach'd the Top of
the Precipice, and during the Light fhot Jack in the Belly.
• Sam came upjud time enough co Save Reeder; for Jack had caught him by the Throat with his
Giant's GraSp—Reeder was wounded, and Jack, dreaming with Blood from his Shoulder and Belly, and
both were cot er'd with Gore and Gafttes.
' In this date Sam was Umpire, and decided the Fate of the Battle,.
' The little Boy foon after found his Way to them: He had a Cutlats, with which they cut off
Jack's Head and Three Finger'd Hand, and took tlv.m in Triumph, follow'd by a vail Concnurfe
oS Negroes, new no longer afraid of Jack's Obi, blowing their Shells and Horn;, and firing Guns in
•heir rude Method. In this Manner they proceeded to Kingdon, a-id claimed the Reward* offered by
the King's Proclamation and the Houfe of Affembly,'
