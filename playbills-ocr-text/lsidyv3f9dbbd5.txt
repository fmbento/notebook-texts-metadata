'	DRURY-LANE.
'Mr. Anderaon, who comes forward to restore Old IlrufJ ' 4o its pri3tine fj'ories, was ijonourei last night with a real boxing-night audience of the old school—a set of jowal Souls, determined not to hear a word of the plaj but to .reserve all their attention for the pantomime.
.At first Mr. Anderson, finding that not a syllable of his Edhyioek could reach any ear, came forward, and taking a good-humoured view of the case said he was pleased at the *‘house-warming ” Then, observing the crowded condition Of the gods—indeed the whole house was crammed to - . suffocation—he stated that the numbers of his eup-garters showed they meant him well, though, he added, they had rather an odd way of showing It. The occupanfs of the galleries continued their vociferations, expressing, by divers idiomatic remarks, their belief that they were too densely thronged, and adding prac-■¿icsl force to those remarks by tearing down the drapery within their reach arid pitching it into the pit. Tho noise , at last became tiresome, and elicited two more speeches '.iiom Mr. Aou.-rBon, in which he stated that he ,	Jbad given ©rders to return the admission money to
the inconvenienced, and protested that he would liaise his prices if the gentry in the gallery did
■	pot reform their r sneers The only pause in the up-Toar was in the trial ccene, when Miss Laura Addison, who played the character of Portia, came forward as the advocate cf the oppressed Antonio. The audience gave her a round of applause, and consented to hear this principal scene of the play.
■	When the curtain had fallen Mr. Anderson re appeared in plain clothes, and in a very good spirit settled all the differences of the evening. He thanked the crowded audience 'lor their support, regretted the unpleasantness which had
■Occurred, end declared his object of giving the drama a Centrtl home while he admitted the merits of the suburban (- directors. In managing the noisy bolyday folks Mr- Ar.der-. eon had f. difficult task to perform, and he certainly got : -through it with much firmness and alao with much good f 5rumour.
The introduction to the pantomime of Harlequlyi and ‘Good Queen Bess, which is the Christmas novelty of the i ¡house, ia one of the hear we have seen for a long time. The ' etc ry is that of Amy Hob-art and the Earl of Leicester, which is worked out in the moat grotesque fashion. Queen Elizabeth, shown first in a dressing-gown, and afterwards with bli the pomp and circumstance which pictures have made so familiar, ia represented to the perfection of carica ure, and is humorously acted by Mr. 21 Bcmer, Leicester, the lady kiher par excellence, with aquiline nose and mind g gait, is played by M. Peulin with a droll foppery, completely recalling the manner of Mr. W. Payne. Amy Rob. r fa baby iB another leading object af snirth- The contending genii who preside over the introduction to the pant' mime, aro the spirits of ** High ^Tragedy,” and of John Rich, the ancient Harlequin. The former would allow the story to come to a dismal terznina*
. tion, but the latter rescues Leicester and Amy by converting them into Harlequin and Columbine, and giving them the usual pantomimic attendants.
The I-Iarliquinade contains some good hits, but wants com* 5>ression, A transformation of Smith field into a s.lubrious locality, after at* infuriated ox has been put to flight by a troop of pointed pens, is a good notion well executed, A case cf “ peace tracts" changing to a group of fighting soldiers is another haony allusion to a topic of the day, As a pantomime scene of the piactical school we have a bedroom in a lodging house, the windows and bed curtains of which are made, hy an ingenious contrivance, to become s> anany stalking ghosts, and thus to terrify the Pantaloon and down. Towards the end romes a diorama representing the . Queen’s visit to Ireland, which did not commence till past 1 ©’clock this morning. A few nights’ performance will doubtless bring the whole closer together—at present it is much too long.
The pantomime actors at Drtiry-lane are exceedingly good. M. Deulin, who acts so well in the introduction, is an able sad efficient Harlequin, -ind with Millie. Theodore, the . Columbine, assists in several surprising feats of agility by '.Messrs. Stilt, the Clown and “Sprite,” who are scarcely to ibe rivalled as posture-masters, and M. J. Deulin, the Fan-¿aloon. Some feats ty Stilt, the Clown, with a Master Stile —a child about six years of age—approached the high ■standard of the renowned Professor ilisley. Still, the most attractive part of the pantomime is the pompous caricature of Queen Elizabeth and her Court.
It seems Mr. Anderson’s intention to manage his theatre with spirit, and it iB to be hoped that success will attend his . , arduous undertaking.

but there s nothing in that, whatever they' may’ sav to the contrary.
It is an Historical Fact, that Good Queen Bess was assisted at her Toilet by many of her noblemen, therefore the

him. therefore we pity his fate, but must admire his wondrous generosity, for all he ever hoped for in return was. Half-a-Crown_

We now- come to Hs-storical Facts, therefore, an the Clown at Astley’s would say, “ Let us be serious"—It is an Historical Fact, that the Earl of Essex, krved, or pretended so, Good Queen Bess, therefore he hated the Earl of Leicester, and thence arose a conspiracy—Sir Waiter Kaleigh (ears his pipe will be put out—Bacon gets quite in a frizzle, and Lord Burleigh shake his head — but there’s nothing in ¡-bat, whatever they may say -o the contrary.
It i- in Hjsi-orijal Fact, that Good Queen Bess was assisted at her Toilet by manv of her noblemen, therefore the
Grand Procession of the Toilette
Is introduced, in which
The Royal WIG ! Ike Royal EDIT ! ! The Royal BLUSHES ! !! & the Royal PETTICOAT ! ! ! Ï
Will ma’»** tfeeii fits' app-arao-ce on an*/ Stage, and trust to the “ usual indulgence of a British Public.” These are followed by
SOOO QUEEN BESS.
■ <lès!tabi&>, as she is. represented in a picture at Hampton ( ’ourt—What come* next will certainly follow—and then will be sect?
»1)01) u'l ’ISEM
In all her Royal splendour—it. is an Historical hart, that Good Queen Bess, ike “ Young Susan''—“ had lovers so many, that she scarcely knew upon which to decide”—and it is an Historical Fact that the following -.s ere a few of them.
f HU REJECTED OWESt
Philip of Spain, Prince Rupert, Prince of Sweden, Duke of Anjou, Prince Alençon. Marquis of Winchester, the King of Sweden Henry of Navarre, An-h-Dtike Charles, Earl of Arundel, Sir William Pickering, Charles Blount and the Earl of Arran.
Good Queen Bess appoints a meeting of these “wondrous proper men” at Kenilworth, but declares, that on her way, “ A hunting
« she will go”.—and having got on the High Horse,” the story gallops on to
CUMNOR HALL by Moonlight
'' Coming events c#-d their sluidows before’ —a Rest thee, my darling”—Ketchy, ketchy, ketchy—“ Put out the light, and then’ —enter the Earl of Leicester on his way to Kenilworth—He stops at Love’s half-way house, the Robsart Arms—“ Oh, Susanna,” or rather “ Oh, Aniy —It can’t be said, “ he makes no bones about it”—They part, “ more in sorrow, than in anger," but, “ being gone, Amy is horsed again”—that is to say, a rather jealous young lady, who in her “deep despair,” introduces her LOVELY
BABBY, to whom she sings the following pathetic stanza
Ci me my b/bby, come along with me j Well go :o far famed Kenilworth, ! Your naughty dai to see."	And so they do.

As it appeared on the occasion of Good Queen Besss Royal A ¡sit. For further particulars enquire of Sit Walter Scott—-It is an historical fact that. Good Queen Bess paid the Earl ot Leicester— -a visit, and “ he paid—the piper”. .This, his gorgeous ft-te .half ruined him, therefore we pity his fate, but must ahn ire his wondrous generosity, for all he ever hoped for in return was Half-a-Crown—
The Earl forest nils Shakspere, by discovering that “ Trie course of I rue love never did run smooth,’’for here he meets with some twenty compe>ikytrs, and to him they do come petit ours, for they prove perfect bears, or more properly speaking, bores—A Lovers Q !. rrel on o, grand scale; a sort of “ tiff for the million” takes place, which, although beginning in Love, ends in War. and the

The revival of the Road to Ruin last night is worth re-» cording, inasmuch as some new performer» made their *
, debut on the occasion. The principal of these is Mrs. Win , Stanley, w ho played the Widow Warren, and made an im ^ pression decidedly favourable. She i? of a good command-’• ing figure, with a handsome countenance and excellent voice, representing the widow as a woman not much, past her prime, and still rejoicing in considerable personal attractions,
. The coquetry with Goldfinch was managed with great point,
. and she conveyed the notion that in such skilful hands coaxing was no difficult matter. Mr. Basil Baker, who came out as Mr, Born ton, was made up well for the geritferaanlike olcl man, and in some of the more marked passages of pathos . he was not ineffective. But, generally speaking^ Isis delivery was monotonous, and he did not brii*g out the more subtiff points of the character. Miss Baker, who played Sophia, has one quality much ii* her favour—-namely, a clear voice, j ' powerful enough to fill o large theatre1- She acre«!, more- ' over, with Ppi?it and intelligence, thougd* she endowed the simple girl with somewhat too much intention«. Mr. Emery, though a well-known performer, is new to such characters aa Silky. His version of the part was clever and well studied, hut he made the rapacity of the usurer more promiiitmt tlu.ii that liypocriiacal smoothness from which Silky derives his name. Characters of move weight than Harry Born torn are better sorted to Mr. Anderson; but lie, • at any rate, gives force to the port; and his • scene of desperate hilarity, when he had resolved to : marry the widow, came out effectively. Mr. F. Mining, who h is always thoroughly versed in the traditions of a character,
. gave a lively repiesentation of Goldfinch. Summing up the w hole, we should atiy that the comedy was acte&m a respect: able, but not a sinking manner.___

It is an Historical Fact, that. Goni Queen Bess was assisted at her Toilet by many of her noblemen, therefore the

We now coroe to Historical Facts, therefore, as the Clown at Astley's would say, “ Let us be serious”—ft is an Historical Fact, tb 1 the Earl of Essex, loved, or pretended so, Good Queen Bess, therefore he hated the Earl of Leicester, and thence aro*=* conspiracy—Sir Walter Kaleigh fears his pipe will be put out—Bacon gets quite in a frizzle, and Lord Burleigh shakes) hie head — but there’s nothing in that, whatever they may say to the contrary.
It is an Historical Fad, that Good Queen Bess was assisted at her Toilet by many of her noblemen, therefore the
grand procession of the toilette.
Is introduced, in which

Iff3
Tlie manner in which Othello lias been brought out at this house is so very creditable to the manager, and so remarkable in its character, that it merits a more special notice than we were enabled to give on the occasion of the first night,
Miss Laura Addison’s Desdemona is still fresh in the memory of the play-going public, as last year she played it alternately with Mrs. Charles Kean ao the Haymarket. Tha large dimensions of Drury-lane are decidedly in her favour, as she is an actress of more power than finish, and her strong passages, as, for instance, the appeal in the fourth act, come out with very great effect. Othello was first played by Mr, Anderson on the occasion of a benefit which lie took during Mr. Macready's management of Drury-lane, and then attracted respectful notice. The want of variation in liis delivery* which has been particularly observable of late years, militates in some degree against the effectiveness of his interpretation* but the dignity of deportment which seems with him to ba innate, and which is one of his best qualifications, is admirably suited to the “ noble” Moor, and the more marked passages of distress and rage are rendered with great power. Mr. Vandenhoff’s Iago is excellent. The villany of the character is never obtruded so as to render it a wonder how any one can trust him; but 3till while tho mask of honesty is carefully worn in the sight of the other characters, a peculiar air of designing confidence reveals tho real man to the audience.
However, it is not only to the acting of the several parts', hut to the general style of production that we refer when wa speak of the Drury-lane OtheUo as a remarkable performance. Having felt on previous occasions that in point of raise m sc&tie Mr. Anderson seemed to be behind his age, we gladly mention this revival as a symptom of abetter state of tilings. Much of the scenery is new', the costumes are costly, and the mere circumstance that in the second act Othello, Iago, and Cassio all appear in armour shows an attention to details of decoration which cannot be too highly commended. The restoration of the characters of Bianca and the Clown from the text of Shakspeare is another good sign, for although these may add but little to the effectiveness of the play, they show that an originating spirit is at work. Since the opening at Christmas we have never seen such decided symptoms of vitality within the walls of Old Drury.

We now come to Historical Facts, therefore, as the Clown at Astley & would say, “ Let us be serious”—It is an Historical Fa.rtf.fet,. the Earl of Essex, loved, or pretended so, Good Queen Bess, therefore he hated the Earl of Leicester, and lher.se « conspiracy—Sir Waller Kaleigh fears his pipe will be put out—Bacon gets quite in a Irizzle, and Lord Burleigh shakes his hasfi—-hut there’s nothing in that, whatever they may say to the contrary.
It is an Historical Fact that Good Queen Bess was assisted at her Toilet by many of her noblemen, therefore the ___
GRAND PROCESSION OF THE TOILETTE.
Is introduced, in which

It is an Historical Fact that Good Queen Bess was assisted at her Toilet by many of her noblemen, therefore the

TUéCO was the second of Schillers plays, and. together with J)ic Rdubers and is ah id und Lidie, makes up the dramatic portion of what is cahed hi-first period, for although Don tiarlos is sometimes assigned to this period, it rather marks a transition to the second. The first three plays are all in prose, and are all marked by a strong attempt at naturalness. The Young Germans had become typed of the French classical school, and sought refuge in that domestic prose drama of which BlL W.A who always influenced Germany more than his own countrymen, was, ina great uva-5ure, the founder. Even Fusco was thought too far removed from common life to suit the Mannheim audience, before whom it was first produced, notwithstanding the author had altered it to meet the prevailing republican taste that he omitted Fiesco’s attempts at supreme power, and represented him as a disinterested patriot. The rough tr Titanismi” of Di ' Raids<\ and the domestic woes of Rabid and Liehe, were move in accordance with their primitive public than a drama which, beiug based upon foreign history, seemed t > demand more erudition than they had taken pains to acquire*
In after times, when Schiller had written that aeries of versified tragedies, which begins with Don Karlos, and reaches its perfection in WaHenstim’s Tod,—when he had gone through that course of Kantian philosophy, of which he made the Marquis of Posa, the exponent,—and when he had again abandoned speculation for production, he despised the three plays which ho wrote in the unsophisticated period of his youth. It was a peculiarity of his temperament to prefer that which he had sedulously produced in accordance with a fixed principle, to that which was the spontaneous oil si . out of his own genius. In this respect the German public was more just to him than he was to himself, and the early plays have always remained favourites with the nation.
According to Schiller's preface, he took- his Fiesco from the CO/ijU’ ad on	Cobite data Louis de Fics^ne, by Cardinal
de Iìetz ; the Jlistoìi <: de Genet, and Robertson’s Charles FAs this last work is probably in the possession of most of our readers, we refer them to it for a brief and most admir able account of the Genoese conspiracy of 1517, of which Fiesco was the head. As in history we have many instances of mighty resuhs from small beginnings, so do we find here an order of things tue reverse of this. The conspiracy by which Fiesco sought to overthrow the Donas, then supreme in Genoa, had been maturely deliberated .tad boldiy conducted ; and the came had already triumphed, when the whole structure tumbled down, amply because Fieseu himself accidentally tumbled from a plank into the sea and was drowned. As this accideut would have been most untragical, it was a fine F ught of Schiller’s to make Fiesco fall, because he is puo»«td from the plank by Verrina, a conspirator. vrho is more sincere than himself, and sees through his ambitious designs. It is, moreover, an historical fact, that Verrina wa- the first person who knew of Fieseo’s death, and thus an Important improvement to the story is gained, with die slightest possible departure from the record,
It is unnecessary t-> give the plot of the drama, not because we assume that it is familiar to all our readers, but because the whole is rather an illustration of an ; !storica 1 event than a drama with what may he strictly ailed a story* i n summing up the b ist<»ry we have in fact briefly set forth the plot, such as it is, for the progress of the conspiracy is, in fact, the progress of the -intimi. The only character highly elaborated is that of Fiesco himself, in which •Schiller lias closely followed history, and the description of which we may therefore take from Roberts m " That young nobleman, Fiesco, the richest and most illustrious subject in the republic, possessed in an eminent degree all the Qualities which win upon the human heart, which command respect, or secure attachment. He was graceful and majestic in his person; magnificent even to profusion, of a generosity that anticipated the wishes of his friends and exceeded the expectations of strangers; of an insinuating address, gentle manners, and a flowing affabi-bility. But. under the appearance of these virtues, which Seemed to form him for enjoying and adorning social life, he concealed all the dispositions winch mark men out for taking the lead in the most dangerous and dark conspiracies, an insatiable and restless ambition, a courage unacquainted with fear, and a mind that disdained subordination. Such a temi ev ; oul i ill l i-ook that station of inferiority wherein lie was placed i \ the republic, and as he envied the power which the elder Paria had acquired, he was filled with indignation at the thoughts of iu descending like an hereditary possession to Già iniettino. These various passions, preying with violence on hi* turbulent and aspiring mind, determined him to attempt uvei turning that domination to which he could not subì fit.”
In the play the dissimulation of Fieso is chiefly shown by his pretended love for the sistei of the younger Boria, whi’e he is really dc voted to hi- own wife, Leonora, an ideal of feiiinine constancy and affection, His wily character is i ontra-to l w ith that of the genuine republican Verrina, who .rates all despots, and has received an injury similar to that which was inti n-.ied to he practised on Virginias.
\ version of this play was last night produced at Druvy-lanc. The adaptation was bv one of our most skilful dramatists the /'‘o', in sd»e was highly liberal and effective,
?.«••’! the prim-ip,.! character was exceed;ugly well played •> Mr. Anderson. Nothing more could have been done f»»v F'C-sn thin » was done by the several parties who contributed to its production, and yet it flagged throughout, and tern-.': noted, leaving a feeling clic reverse of enthusiastic, if not deci dedly unfavourab! e.
Mr. Flanche’s work was chiefly one of abridgment. A situation powerful, but coarse, in which Fiesco exposes to his wife the weakness of tiie coquette Julia, and the death of Leon ra- by the band oilier own husband he Las omitted,and he l as cut down speeches and dialogue without remorse. For this he is not in the '.east to blame. The playacted about three hours and a half last night, and without his reduction it would doubtless have lasted double the time, The omitted situation*- we e dangerous, ami we cannot conceive that they would materially have contributed to the success of the piece.

The Time».
Fiesco was the second of Schiller'', flays. The yoanS’ Germans hud become tired of the French em-ioat school, and sought refuge in that domestic prose drama of which Diderot, who always influenced Germany more than his own country -men. was, in a great measure, the founder. It is unnecessary to give the plot of the drama. The only character highly elaborated is that of Fiesco himself, in which Schiller has closely followed history, and the description of which we rnav therefoie take from Robertson:—"That young nobleman, Fieseo, the richest and most iliaslrious subject in the republic, possessed in an eminent degree all the qualities which w in upon the human heart, which command respect, or secure attachment.
He was graceful and majestic in his person; magnificent even to profusion, of a generosity that anticipated the wishes of his friends and exceeded the expectations oi strangers ; of an insinuating address, gentle manners, aid a flowing affability. But, under the appearance of these virtues, which seem to form him for enjoying and adorning social life, he concealed all the dispositions which murk men out for taking the lead in the most dangerous and dark conspiracies, an insatiable and restless ambit on. a courage unacquainted with fear, and a mind that disdained subordination. Such a temger could ill brook that fetation of inferiority wherein he was placed in the republic, and as Le envied the power which the eider Doriu had acquired, he was filled with indignation at the thoughts of it descending like an hereditary possession to Gi&nnettino. These various passions, preyii.g w ith violence on Isis turbulent ai d aspiring mind, determined him to attempt overturn» g that domination to which .e could not submit,"
, A version of this play was produced at Drury Lane, on Monday, V ebruory 4th, Ti e adaptation was bv one of our U:0:,! skilful dramatists. THE MISE E!\ SCEISE WAS HIGHLY LIBERAL AND EFFECTIVE, and the principal character was exceedingly well played by Mr Anderson. Nothing more could have been done for Eiesco than was done bv the several patties who contributed to its production. Fiesco, 83 we have said, is the principal person. Leonora and Yernna, with their de votion, one to a husband, the other to a cause, claim the sympathies) of an audience, and the n:ana«er did all he could for them by assigning their, to Mis., Addision and Mr Yai.deuhoff.
LET US ADD THAT THE ATTE.MPX on mb. ANDERSON TO INTRODUCE TO THE PUBLIC AN
AUTHOR HIGHLY ESTEEMED BY THE LITERARY 'WORLD. BUT STRANGE TO THE MERE PLAYGOER, IS MOST CREDITABLE TO HIS MANAGEMENT.
The Morning Poet
A version of Schiller's celebrated play si- Fiesco ; or, (he Revolt of Genoa, was produced last night for the first time in this country
1 he intention of the tragedy is us honourable as it is zealously expounded. The rabid vices and passions of an uncurbed de-ivocracy art laid bare; the self-seeking ted glorification of Republicans are drawn with a master hand, and the political benefits und moral blessings of a constitutional monarchy eloquently insisted upon; and v* ith such a noble purpose many faults or dramatic skill will be free!) pardoned.
Mr, Anderson, as.F;tsco, has added greatly to his dramatic reputation. It was carefully considered, and the opposing phases of the character were contrasted wit!» artisdc delicacy. There is but S;?wt opportu» itv afforded for the exhibition of high wrought passion, but many of the ¡joints were given with exceeding power, and his recitation or the allegory of the contusion of the empire oi the animals was masterly. The pause at the close, in which he alludes to thee, choice oi a “ monarch,” v us subtlelv conceived and admirably delivered.
THE TRAGEDY HAiS BEEN GORGEOUSLY PLACED UPON (HE STAGE. THE SCENERY is> ADMIRABLY PAINTED AND THE DRESSES ARE RICH AND PICTURESQUE. THE SALOON IN tTESCO’SjPA.LACE DURING THE MASKED FETE is ALMOST WITHOUT A PARALLEL. THE ENTIRE RANGE OF’ THE STAGE IS FILLED WITH
CHARACTERS IN VARIOUS GAY COSTUMES, THE BACK PORTION OF WHICH lb RAISED AND APPROACHED BY FLIGHTS OF STEPS. HERE ARE DANCERS AND MAsQUERS, WHILE IN THE FRONT ARE PATIES SEATED GAMING AND DISPORTING IN ALL THE JOYOUS EXCITEMENT OF A RIOOTTO. SHEET.- OF PLATE GLASS
reflect innumerable girandoles filled WITH LIGHTS. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE SCENE IS AS NEW AS IT IS BRILLIANT AND STRIKING. THE CITY OF GENOA, WITH ITS FA LACES AND SEA IN THE PERSPECTIVE, IS ADMIRABLY PAINTED, AND REFLECTb VERY GREAT PRAISE ON THE ARTIST.
w e have seldom witnessed u more perfect Impersonation
than the Vervim of Mr. Vandcnlioff. It was sturdy, and full of natural pathos. The dignity upon taking the vow of vengeance for the insult to his child and the vacillation, deep tenderness, and iron resolution of his last appeal to Fiesco; were each and all lofty expositions of dramatic art. The character stood out in hold and admirable relief from the surrounding groups. Mi. Cooper acted the old Doge with commendable dignity, and Mr. Emery, as the Mocr, was picturesque and effective.
Miss Laura Addison, as Leonora, fully sustained Iter deservedly high reputation. The intense love Cor Fiesco, the glory in his elevation, the fear and the agonv lest he should fall a victim to his ambition, were passionately "and pathetically embodied. The scene in which the Marquis de Calcagno
pleads Ids love, and is repulsed was nobly performed. The fast interview with Fiesco, in which the contending emotions of pride and anguish seek for mastery, was spleudedlv rendered and enthusiastically applauded.
Mrs. Tertian, iu the character of the Princess, acted with great care, and imparted weight to a part scarcely worths of her talent.
THE TRAGEDY WAS RECEIVED WITH APPLAUSE. ■	•	■
Th® Morning Horrid.
An English version of Schiller1!, Fiesco was brought out at iJrury Lane. on Monday, February 4th, with great discrimination as regards choice, tor it is well calculated to serve the cause o! ‘ Legitimacy.”
^ in the preface to this tragedy, Schiller describes his object as being todel ncate '‘the victim of art and cabal’’ in opposition to
Ike hero of^ his play of the Robbers, where»; he undertook to uoilray tUe vict.ni of an extravagant sens’.bditv.15 He blends

T he difficult and dangerous duty of t ms adapting the work of so great a Writer has been alfoitei to one long skilled in dramatic construction; and MS PLANCHE: HAS PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH TASTE AND FELICITOUS TACT. Mr Anderson's Fiesco was a forcible delineation of the double character he sustains. His best scene wi. that in which Le frustrates his attempted assassination by the Moor and converts him to bis service. The next mosttiapoifciru par:—that of Verrina—is exactly suited to Mr VaudeaUH^, who gave great force to the scene where he discovers In*, daughter’s dishonour and resolves on revenge. Mr Kaieq>Av Moor was sufficiently individualised, without quite etv.ho<^£4£ the conception of Achiller; ai.d the Lenora of ML? [Aura Addison was effective.

f'--.-S'-O wits the second of Schiller's piavs. The younf Germans had become tired of the French classical school, and sought refuge in that domestic prose drama of which Diderot, who always influenced Germany more than his own countrymen, was, in a great measure, the founder. It is unnecessary to give the plot, of the drama. The oitlv character highly elaborated is that of Fiesco himself, in which Schiller has closely followed history, and the description of which we rnav therefore take iron, Robertson:—“That young nobleman, Fiesco, the richest and most illustrious subject in the republic, possessed in an eminent degree all the qualities which win upon the bumar heart, which command respect, or secure attachment. He was graceful and majestic in his person; magnificent even to profusion, of a generosity that anticipated the wishes of his friends and exceeded the expectations of strangers; of at! insinuating address, gentle manners, and a flowing affability. But, under the. appearance of these virtues, which seem to form him for enjoying and adorning social life, he concealed all the dispositions which mark men out for taking the lead in the most dangerous and dark conspiracies, an insatiable and restless ambit on, a courage unacquainted with fear, and a mind that disdained subordination. Such a temper could ill brook that station of inferiority wherein he was placed in the republic, and as v.e envied the power which the elder Dona had acquired, he vas filed with indignation at the thoughts of it descending like an hereditary possession to Giannettino. These various passions,
preying with violence on his turbulent and aspiring mind, determined him -a attempt overturning that domination o which
he could not submit.”
A version of this play was produced at Drury Lane, on Monday, February 4th. The adaptation was by one of our most skilful dramatists, THE MlSE EJ\ SCEi\E WAS HIGHLY LIBERAL AND EFFECTIVE, and the principal character was exceedingly well played by Mr Anderson. Nothing more could have been done tor Fiesco than was done by the se\ eral parties who contributed to its production. Fiesco, as we have .-aid, ,s the principal person. Leonora and Verrina, with their devotion, ont. to a husband, the other to a cause, claim the sympathies of an audience, and the manager did all he oulci for them by assigning them to Mis- Addition and Mr Yandenhoff.
LET GS ADD THAT THE ATTEMPT OF MR ANDERSON TO INTRODUCE TO THE PUBLIC- AN AT THOR HIGHLY ESI EE MED BY THE LITERARY WORLD. BUT STRANGE TO THE MERE PLAYGOER, IS MOST CREDITABLE TO HIS MANAGEMENT.
Tlie morning Post
A version t f Schiller's celebrated play of fiesco ; or, the Revolt of Genoa, was produced last night for the first time in this country.
I he intention of the tragedy is as honourable as it is zealously expounded. The rabid vices '«ad passions of an uncurbed dei: ocraey are laid bare; the self-seeking and glorification of Republicans are drawn with a ma-ter hand, and the political benefits and moral blessings of a constitutional monarchy eloquently insisted upon; and witli such a noble purpo.e rnanv faults of dramatic skill will he freely pardoned.
Mr, Anderson, as Fiesco. has added greatly to his dramatic reputation It was carefully considered, and the opposing phases of the. character were contra-fed with artistic ielicaey. There is but scantopportunity afforded for the exhibitior of high wrought passion, but many of the points were given with exceeding power, and his recitation of the allegory of the confusion of the empire of the animals was masterly. T le pause at the close, in which he alludes to their choice ol a monarch,” was sultlely conceived and admirably delivered.
THE TRAGEDY HAS BEEN GORGEOUSLY PLACED UPON 1HE STAGE, THE SCENERY IS ADMIRABLY PAINTED AND THE DRESSES ARE RICH AND PICTURESQUE THE SALOON IN FfESCO’S ¿PALACE DURING THE MASKED FETE IS ALMOST WITHOUT A PARALLEL. THE ENTIRE RANGE OF THE STAGE JS FILLED WITH
CHARACTERS in various gay costumes,
THE BACK PORTION OF WHICH IS RAISED AND APPROACHED BY FLIGHTS OF STEPS. HERE ARE DANCERS AND MAsQI ERS, WHILE IN THE FROM ARE PATIES SEATED GAMING AND DISPORTING IN ALL THE JOYOUS EXCITEMENT OF A R1D0TT0. SHEETS OF PLATE GLASS REFLECT INNUMERABLE GIRANDOLES FILLED WITH LIGHTS. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE SCENE IS AS NEW AS IT IS BRILLIANT AND STRIKING. THE CITY 01 GENOA. WITH ITS PALACES AND SEA IN THE PERSPECTIVE, IS ADMIRABLY PAINTED. AND REFLECiS VERY GREAT PRArSE ON THE ARTIST.
We have seldom witnessed u more perfect impersonation than the Verr.na oi Mi. Yandeniioif. It was sturdy, and full til natural pathos. The dignity upon taking the vow of vengeance for the insult to hi.- liild. and the vacillation, deep tenderness, and iron resolution ox bis last appeal to Fiesco, were each and all lofty expositions of dramatic art. The character stood out in told and admirable relief from the surrounding groups. Mr. Cooper acted the old Doge with commendable dignity, and Mr. Emery as the Moor, was pictures! ue and effective.
Miss Laura Addison as Leonora, fully sustained her deservedly high reputation. Ti e intense love for Fiesco, the glory in his elevation, the fear and the agony lest he should Mi a victim to his ambition, y, »re passionately and pathetically embodied. The scene m winch the Marquis de Cdeagno pleads his love, and ¡s repulsed was nobl\ performed. The last interview with Fiesco. in which the contending emotions of pride and anguish seek lor mastery, was splendidly nude red and enthusiastically applauded.
Mr-. Ternau, in the character oi the Princess, acted with great care, and imparted weight to a part scarcely worthy ox her talent.	J

In ‘he preface to this tragedy, Schiller describes his object as being to delineate "the victim of art and cabal” in opposition to the hero of his play of the Robbers, wherein he undertook to portray ‘ the \ ict m of an extravagant sensibility.’’ He “ blends
together the MAN and the POLITICIAN, and draws from Sat refined intrigues of state situations interesting to humanity*” Schiller has endeavoured to individualise the characters wris are grouped together in this drama; and there is a certain degree of elemental force in the several portraitures. The hes% as the central figure upon whom the action revolves, is described, according to the formula of the author, as "a yomg mar, of dignified pride and majestic affability, with courtly complaisance and deceitfulness,” ..»nd these characteristics £a?r-w ell preserved with effective art. Schiller's sympathies toy more immediately with tee inflexible Verrina, whose maxims^’ equality and patriotism are couched in phrases of rugged aaa-
plicitv : and this worthy more than divides with the gallant young aristocrat the attention the audience bestow, particularly in the last scene, when the despiser of individW authority broadly unfolds his political prejudices, and because he cannot make a convert, resorts to violence—as all suir. demagogues are disposed to do, notwithstanding the plenitude cf their charity and humanity.
The actors 'did their best with the bl»nk i erse of the adapter. Mr Anderson declaimed the ambitious -oliquies of the Given: with emphatic vigour, and the ominous denunciations of ihe methodical and implacable Verrina were delivered with appse-priate weight and gravity by Mr Vandenheff. Mr Cooper, as, the venerable duke, was steady and sententious; and Mr €1 Fisher, as bis nephew, and Mr Cathcart, as the couriar Lomellino, were excellent; in which category may be included Mr Emery, who gave the confessions aud ironies of the repress,« Moor with graphic boldness. The wife of Eie-cc was pla-yad
with earnestniss and feelingly Miss Laura Addison, wbae intensity of manner invested the scenes oi the tragedy in wh:«iV she was concerned with a pathos which the artificiality of (ifee stage purpose could never of itself have suggested ; and Mrs Ternan was an imposing representative of Julia, the haugfah;-

Schiller’s historical tragedy, Fiesco: or, the Genoese Got-& piracy, was produced on Monday evening at this theatre, Hie first occasion, as far as we are at present informed of its performance in this country.
The extreme length alone of the origin«! work would prechdu its representation in this country, in the exact form in wiikfe the author wrote it; but, with that object in view, excision want evr-n more neeefcsary than compression, as there are scenes at the original which could not be played before an English audience r whose taste, although restricted in range, is so truef, however faithfully those passages may -accord with the al-draff' principles' of dramatic art. The difficult and dangerous duty-ef tfiu- adapting the work of so great a writer has been allotted ftr. one long skilled in dramatic construction; and MR PL AN CUE HAS PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH TASTE AND FELICITOUS TACT. Mr Anderson’s Fieseo was a foreifiK de lineation of the double character he sustains. His best scene that in which he frustrates his attempted assassination by tk-Moor, and converts him to his service. The next most imports, part—that of Verrina—is exactly suited to Mr VandenLuC who gave great force to the scene w here he discovers hH daughter’s dishonour and resolves on revenge. Mr EmeryY
Moor was sufficiently individualised, without quite embodying the conception of' Schiller; and the Lenora oi Miss La.ur; Addison was effective The minor characters are very numerous, and requiring actors of respectable ability Thev were generally well sustained.

On Monday last, Schiller’s historical play, Fiesco. or, fo Recoil of Genoa, was produced at this house in a style of gre® splendour, and with every sign of elaborate care. The presew. notice will be brief, as the drama has, ¡a fact, not yet been w

THE TRAGEDY WAS RECEIVED WITH APPLAUSE.
The Morning Herald.
An English version of Schiller’s Fiesco was brought out at ijrury Lane, or. Monday, February 1th, with great discritnina-
hon as regards choice, iur it is well t-alcolated to serve the cause of ‘ Legitimacy.”
^ In the preface to this tragedy, Schiller describe-« his object as being to delineate “the \icMn of art and cabal” in opposition to he hero oi^ his play of the Robbers, wherein he undertook to j.orir;iy *• tiie victim of an extravagant sensibility.” He ,f blends
together the MAN and the POLITICIAN, and draws from the refined intrigues of state situations interesting to humanity.M
Schiller has endeavoured to individualise the characters who are grouped together in this drama ; and there is a certain degree of elemental force i,i the several portraitures. The hero, as the central figure upon whom the action revolves, is described, according to the formula of the author, as “a young man of dignified pride and majestic affability, with courtly complaisance and deceitfulness,” and these characteristics are well preserved wit-li effective art. Schiller’s sympathie* lay
more immediately with the inflexible Verrina, whose maxims of equality and patriotism axe couched in phrases of rugged simplicity ; and this worthy more than divides with the gallant young aristocrat the attention the audience bestow-, particularly in the last scene, when the de-piser of individual authority -broadly unfolds his political prejudices, and because be cannot make a com>ert, resorts to violence—as all such demagogues are disposed to do, notwithstanding the plenitude, of their charity and humanity.
The actors did their best with the blank verse of the adaptor.
Mr Anderson declaimed the ambitious soliquies of the Count with emphatic vigour, and the ominous denunciations of the methodical and implacable Yerrina were delivered with appropriate weight and gravity by Mr Vatidenheff, Mr Cooper, as
the venerable duke, was steady and sententious ; and Mr C Fisher, as his nephew, and Mr Cathcart, as the courtier
Lomellino, were excellent ; in which category may be included Mr Emery, who gave the confessions and ironies of the reprobate Moor with graphic boldness. The wife of Fiesco was played with earnestness and feeling by Miss Laura Addison, whose intensity of manner invested the scenes of the tragedy in which she was concerned with a pathos which the artificiality of the stage purpose could never of itself have suggested ; and Mrs Tertian was an imposing representative ot Julia, the haughty princess. THE HOUSE WAS CROWDED.
The Morning Chronicle.
Schiller’s historical tragedy, Fiesco ■ or, the Genoese Oon-f 'rraey, was produced on Monday evening at this theatre, the first occasion, as far as we are at present informed of its performance- in this country.
The extreme length alone of the original work would preclude
its representation in this country, in the exact form in which the author w rote it ; but, with that object in Hew, excision was even more necessary than compression, as there a:e acenea in the original which could not be played before am English audience ( whose taste, although restricted in range, is sa true), however faithfully those passages may accord with the abstract principles of dramatic art. The difficult and dangerous duty of thus adapting the work of so great a writer has been allotted to one long skilled in dramatic construction; and MR PLANCHE HAS PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH TASTE AND FELICITO!' S TACT. Mr Anderson’s Fresco was a forcible delineation of the double character ho sustains. His best seen-; wm that in which he frustrates his attempted assassinatio t by tb • Moor, and converts him to his service. The next most important
part—t!\at of Verrina—is exactly suited to Mr X andenhoft, who gave great force to the scene where he discovers his daughter’s dishonour and resolves on revenge. Mr Emery’s Moor was sufficiently individualised, without quite embodying the conception of Schiller. and the Lenora of Miss Laura Addison was effective. The minor characters are very numerous, and requirine actors of respectable ability They were generally well sustained. THE PLAY WAS WELL PUT ON THÉ STAGE AS REGARDS COSTUME AND DECORATIONS. DURING THE PERFORMANCE THE APPLAUSE AYAS FREQUENT, ESPECIALLY DURING THE PIRST TWO ACTS AND AT THE END
The Morning Advertiser.
On Monday last, Schiller’s historical play, Fiesco, or, the
Revolt of Genoa, was produced at this house in a style of great splendour, a ad with every sign of elaborate care. The present
notice will be brief, as the drama has, in fact, not. yet been seen in such a manner as to allow justice to be rendered, eithej- to its merits as an acting play, nor to those able artistes who exerted themselves so laboriously in the several leading characters. Fiesco has long been before the reading public in this country, though now for the first time introduced upon the s'age. It has recently appeared in the volume of Schiller's works, containing the “ early dramas and romances,’’ forming a portion of Mr. Henry S, Bohn’s admirable Standard Library. A translation, indeed, was pi,Wished so far back as ITT), but it was very defective. Ano her came out some eighteen years ago, and a third about nine years since. Mr. Bohn’s version, however is in all respects most satisfactory, and, in fact, is the only one which give the tragedy entire. We shall
be anxious to witness the result, when careful revision shall
have greatly abridged all unsuited passages. THE PLAY IS SO MAGNIFICENTLY PLACED UPON THE STAGE THAT TT IS WORTH BEING PRESENT AT IIS REPRESENTATION, IF MERELY FOR THE SPLENDOUR OF THE PAGEANTRY, AS WELL AS OF THE GORGEOUS DRESSES AND APPOINTMENTS, AND THE BEAUTY OF THE FINE SCENERY INTRODUCED IN THE COURSE OF IT. Of the acting we shall take another opportunity to speak in detail. It must now suffice to mention that Mr. Anderson labouied effectively and spiritedly (despite hL evident suffering from hoarseness) in the part of Fiesco • that Mr. Yandenhoff was excellent as Venina ; and that Miss Addison made an engaging and impressive representative oi
Leonora. The other heading characters were skilfully sustained. THE HOUSE NY AS CROWDED.
The Daily News.
A translation of Schiller's Fif.ro was produced at this theatre on Monday evening. Great care was bestowed apuó the performance. Mr Anderson exerted himself greatly in UÍ part of Fiesco, and was very successful in the long soliloquy in ■ which Fiesco muses on the nature of his enterprise Mis-Laura Add Lon acted Leonora with grace and feeling, and Mrs Teman, as the Princess Julia, did what could be done with a most ungrateful part. ?n the performance of the other characters there was nothing remarkable, excepting that of Hassar; the villanous Moor, whose sneering, sarcastic coolness was ex-> cecdingly well expressed by Mr Emery.

THE L£S i 6 E	,
In offering Ms respectful acknowledgments to the Friends of ike
LEGITIMATE DRAMA, for the patronage conferred on Ms endeavours
to restore it to i s original importance at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, begs further to testify Ms sense of the general interest taken in his attempt to place before a BRITISH TRIBUNAL, one of the most admired pro ductions of the most gifted of German authors - SCHILLER.
Worn out as the public seem to have been by the translations of the more .light and transient dramatic writings of OTHER NATIONS, those of the GERMAN seem to have been entirely overlooked; THE LESSEE, therefore, conceived the idea of presenting to the Public some of the greatest
works of the best German writers, alternately with those of English Authors,
so as to form an agreeable change to the patrons of the Classic Drama.
THE APPLAUSE BESTOWED ON “ FUSCO” BY INTELLECTUAL AND CROWDED AUDIENCES, encourages him to hope that his policy is justly responded to, and that the opportunity thus afforded to the Public of witnessing the renresentationof great German plays in succession with ORIGINAL‘WORKS OF LIVING DRAMATISTS, may not be
altogether unacceptable to the friends of the Drama; while, at the same timo thoy may b© brought bacli from the contemplation of Foreign

The Times.
tesro was the second ci Schiller’s plays. The youue Germans had become tired of the French classical school, and sought refuge in that domestic prose drama of which Diderot, who always influenced Germany more than h.s own countrymen, was, in a great measure, the founder. It is unnecessary W g'^e the plot of the dratna. The ordy character highly elaborated is that of hiesco hiaiseli, in which Schiller has close!v
followed history, and the description of which we mav therefore lake from Robertson“ That young nobleman, Fiesco, the richest and most ill usirious subject ir the republic, possessed
an eminent degree all rhe qualities which win upon the human heart, which command respect, or secure attachment. He was graceful and majestic in his person; magnificent even to profusion, of a generosity that anticipated the wishes of his friends and exceeded the expectations of strangers; of an in-«■inuating address, gentle manners, and a flowing" affability. But. under the appearance of these virtues, which seem to form him for enjoying and adorning social life, he concealed all the dispositions which mark men out for taking the lead in the most, dangerous and dark conspiracies, an insatiable and restless ambition, a course unacquainted with fear, and a mind that disdained subordination. Such a temper could ill brook that station of inferiority wherein he Vac placed in the republic, and as be envied ¡be power which the elder Doria had acquired, he
ft as filled with indignation at the thoughts ed it descending like an hereditary possession to Giannettino. These various passions, preying with violence on his turbulent and aspiring mind, determined him to attempt overturning that domination to which Le could not. submit.”
A version of this play , was produced at Drury Lace, ot\ Monday, February 4th. The adaptation was by one of our moat skilful dramatists. THE MlSE EJS SCENE W AS HIGHLY LIBERAL AND EFFECTIVE, end thj principal character was exceedingly well played by Mr Anderson. Nothing more could have been done for Fiesco than wa3 done by the severs! parties who contributed to its production. Fiesco, as we have said, is the principal person. Leonora and Verona» w itii their devotion, one to a husband, the other to a cause, claim
the sympathies «.f an audience, and the manager did all he could tor them by assigning them to Miss Addi&ioo aad M r
Yandenhoff.
LF/f US ADD THAT TUB ATTEMPT OF MR. AN DERSON TO INTRODUCE TO THE PUBLIC AN AUTHOR HIGHLY ESTEEMED BY THE LITERARY WORLD. BUT STRANGE TO THE MERE PLAYGOER, IS MOST CREDITABLE TO HIS MANAGEMENT.
The Morning Post.
A version of Schiller's celebrated play of Fusco ; or, f\e Revolt of Genoa, was produced last n:ght for the first time m t his country.
1 he intention of the tragedy is as honourable as it is zealously expounded. The rabid vices and pasiiur»5 of an uncurbed democracy are laid bare; the aelf-seekin j and gloritication of Republicans are drawn with a master hand, and the political
benefits and moral blessings of a constitutional monarchy elo-I quently insisted upon; and with such a noble purpose many faults ot dramatic skill will be freely pardoned.
Mr. Anderson, as Fiesco, las added «rautly to his drama; ie reputation. It was carefully considered, and the opposing phases of the character wore contrasted with artistic delicacy. There is but scant opportunity afforded for the exhibition oi high wrought passion, but many of the points were given with exceeding cower, and his recitation of the allegory of the to? -fusion ot the empire of the ai:finals was masterly. Th- pause at the close, in which he alludes to ihetr choice of a monarch,’’ was subfielv rcnceived and admirably delivered.
the Tragedy has been gorgeously PLACED UPON 1'HE STAGE, THE SCENERY IS
ADMIRABLY PAINTED, AND THE DRESSES ARE RICH AND PICTURESQUE. THE SALOON IN FIESCO’S ^PALACE DURING THE MASKED FETE is ALMOST WITHOUT A PARALLEL. TIIE ENTIRE RANGE OF THE STAGE IS FILLED vWTH CHARACTERS i.N VARIOUS S-.VY COSTUMES. THE BACK PORTION OF WHICH IS RAISED Uv > APPROACHED BY PLIGHTS OF STEPS. HER1 ARE DANCERS AND MASQUERS, WHILE IN THE FRONT .ARE PATIES SF ITED GAMING AND DISPORTING IN ALL THE JOYOUS EXCITEMENT OF A R1D0TT0. ¿HEELS OF PLATE GLASS UE.TECT iNNUMKRABLE GIRANDOLES FrLLED Willi LIGHTS. THE ARRANGEMENT OF 1'IIE SCENE IS AS NEW AS IT IS BRILLIANT AND STRIKING. THE CITY OF GENOA, W ITH* ITS
PALACES AND SEA IN THE PERsFEOTIV; :y ADMIRABLY PAINTED, AND REFLLG1VERY GREAT PRAISE ON THE ARTIST.
Wc have seldom witnessed a more perfset mperscast.io;: than the Verrina of 3L. Yaodeohoif. i t wav jiurdv. and full of natural pathos. The dignity upon taking the vov, of vengeance for the insult to his child, and the vaci'bion, deep tenderness, and iron resolution of his last appeal to Fitocr. v »re each and all lofty expositions of dramatic art. The character stood out in bold and admirable relief from the rruunding groups, Mr, Cooper acted the old Doge with commeadfcbk dignity, and Mr. Emery, as the Moor, was piettuesque uird r ffecti vs.
Miss Laura Addison, as Leonora, fully svstuuied her deservedly Mgh reputation. The intc .se ’ove lor Fiesoo, the glory in hi- elevation, the fear and. the age-.-.v less he sbcuH fall.	‘	'
embo
together the MAN and the POLITICIAN, and draws from the reSii/.d intrigues of atute situations interesting to humanity
¿chiller has endeavoured to individualise the characters who are grouped together in this drama; and there is a certain degree of elemental force in the several portraitures. The hero, as the central figure upon whom the action revolves, is described, according to the formula of lite author, as "a young man of dignified pride and majestic affability, with courtly
complaisance and deceitfulness,” and these characteristics are well preserved with effective art. Schiller’s sy mpathies lay more immediately with the infle::!ble Verrina, whose maxims of equality aad patriotism are couched in phrases of rugged simplicity; and this worthy more than divides with the gailaut young aristocrat the attention the audience bestow, particularly in the last seene, when the despiser of individual authority broadly unfolds his political prejudices, and because he cannot make a convert, resort« to violence—as all such demagogues are disposed to do, notwithstanding the plenitude of their charily and humanity,
The actors did thrir best with the brick verse of the adaptor. Mr Anderson declaimed the ambitious eoliquie» of the Count with emphatic vigour, and the ciamou» denunciations of the methodical and implacable Verrina were delivered wit’t appropriate weight and gravity by Mr Vandetheff. Mr Cooper. a«s the venerable duke, was steady and sententious ; and Mr C.
Fisher, as bis nephew, and Mr Catitear!, as the courtier LomeHino, were excellent; in which category may be included Mr Emery, who gave the con Sessions aud ironies of the reprobate Moor with graphic boldness. The wife of Fiesco was played w ith earne&tnsss aad feeling by Miss Laura Addison, whose intensity of manner invested the scenes of the tragedy in which sise was concerned with a pathos which the artificially of the stage purpose could never of itself have suggested ; and Mr* Teman was aa imposing representative of Julia, the haughty princess. ¡THE HOUSE WAS CROWDED.,

Schiller's historical tragedy, Fiesco, or, fte Gen-yes i Con-, sviraoj, was produced on Monday evening at this theatre, the / f-cat occasion, as far as we arc at presad irformed, of its per-
fermance iu this country.
The extreme length alose of the original work would preclude its representation in this country, in the exact form ia which the author wrote it; but, with that object in view, excision was even mote necessary than cctnprefwoa, as there are --oeae« rl the original which could not be played before an Enjfi«h audience < whose taste, although restricted in range, is so Lie), however faithfully those passages may accord with the abstract principle? of dramatic art. The difficult and dangerous duty of thus adapting the work of so great a writer has been allotted to
one bog skilled in dramatic construction; and ME PLANCHE HAS PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH TASTE AND
FELICITOUS TACT. Mr AnderaonG Fiesco was a forcible delineation of the double character he sustains. His best scene was that in which he frustrates his attempted assasánatio t by the Moor, and converts him to his service. The next most important part—that of Verrina—is exactly suited to Mr Vandty.n/jiT,
who gave great force to the scene where, he discovers, his daughter’s dishonour and resolves on revenge. Mr Emery’s Moor was sufficiently individualised, without quite embodying the* conception of ¿chiller; and the Lenora ot Miss Laura Addison was effective. The minor characters are very nutn?ron«, ar.d requiring actors of respectable ability They were genera.-! i well sustained. THE PLAY VYA8 WELL PUT ON TB K STAGE AS REGARDS COSTUME AND DECORATIONS. DURING THE PERFORMANCE THE APPLAUSE WAS FREQUENT, ESPECIALLY DURING THE FIRS I’ TWO ACTS AND AT THE END.

human heart which command respect, or ¿ecute attachment. He was graceful and majestic ir his person; magnificent even
to profusion, oi a generosity that anticipated the wishes of his friends and exceeded the expectations of strangers; of an insinuating address, gentle manrers, and a Sowing affability. But, under the appearance of these virtues, which seem to form bito for enjoying and adorning social life, he concealed all the dispositions which mark me» out for taking the lead in the most dangerous and dark conspiracies, an insatiable and restless ambit.on, a courage unacquainted with fear, and a mind that disdained subordination. Suck a temper could ill brook that station of inferiority wherein heVas placed in the republic, and as he envied the power which tne elder Doria had acquired, he was filled with indignation at the thought* of if descending like an hereditary possession to Giannettino. These various passions, preying with violence on his turbulent and aspiring mind, determined him to attempt overturning that domination to which he could not submit.”
A version of this play was produced at Drury Lane, on Monday, February 4th. The adaptation was bv cne of our most skilful dramatists. THE MISE Eft SCENE WAS HIGHLY LIBERAL AND EFFECTIVE, and the principal character was exceedingly well played by Mr Anderson. Nothing more could have been dune for Fiesco thaa Was done by the several parties who contributed to its production. Fiesco, as we have said, is the principal person. Leonora and Verrtna, v. ith their devotion, one to a husband, the other to a cause, claim the sympathies of an audience, and the manager did all he could for theta by assigning them to Miss Addisioa and M Yandenhoff.

A version of Schiller's celebrated play of Fiesco or, the Revolt of Genoa, v as produced lust night for the first time iit ties country.
1 he intention of the tragedv ¡s as honourable as it is zealously expounded. The rabid vices and passions of an unc urbed democracy are laid bare; the self-seeking and glorification of Republicans are drawn with a master hand, and the political benefits and moral blessings of a constitutional monarchy eloquently insisted upon; and wish such a noble purpose "many faults of dramatic skill will be freely pardoned,
Mr. Anderson, as Ficscq, has added greatly to his dramatic reputation. It w as carefully considered, and the opposing phases of the character were contrasted with artistic delicacy. There is but scant opportunity afforded for the exhibition of High wrought passion, but many of the points were given with exceeding power, and his recitation of the allegory of the confusion of the empire of the animals was masterly. The pause at the close, in which he alludes to their choice of a “ monarch,” was subtlely conceived and admirably delivered.
THE TRAGEDY HA'S BEEN GORGEOUSLY PLACED UPON THE STAGE, THE SCENERY IS ADMIRABLY PAINTED, AND THE DRESSES ARE RICH AND PICTURESQUE.

than the Vernna of Mr. Vandeohoif. It was sturdy, and full of natural pathos. The dignity upon taking the vow of vengeance for the insult to his child, and the vacillation, deep tenderness, and iron resolution of his last appeal to Fiesco, were each and all lofty expositions of dramatic art. The character Hood out in bold and admirable relief from the surrounding groups. Mr. Cooper acted the old Doge with commendable dignity, and Mr. Emery, as the Moor, was picturesque and effective.
Miss Laura Addison, as Leonora, fully sustained her deservedly high reputation. The intense love for Fiesco, the glory in his elevation, the iear and the agony lest he should fall a victim to his ambition, were passionately and pathetically __ embodied. The scene in which the Marquis de Calcagno I pleads bis love, and is repulsed was nobly performed. The last interview with Fiesco, in which the contending emotions of
pride and anguish seek for mastery, was spletidedly rendered and enthusiastically applauded.
Mrs. Teman, iu the character of the Princess, acted with great care, and imparted weight to a part scarcely worthy of her talent.	”

The Morning Chronicle.
Schiller’s historical tragedy, Fiesco. or, the Genoese Conspiracy, was produced on Monday evening at this theatre, the first occasion, as far as we are at present informed, of its performance in this country.
The extreme length alone of the original work would preclude its representation in this country, in the exact form ia which the author wrote it; but, with that object in view, excision »as
even more necessary than compression, a> there are se-eoe» in the original which could not be played before an Eagtish
audience (»hosi"r taste, although restricted in range, is so trag), how ever faithfully those passages may accord with the abstract principles of dramatic art. The difficull and dangerous doty of thus adapting the work of so great a writer has been allof.tM (--• one long skilled in dramatic construction; and MR BLANC HP, HAS PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH TASTE AND FELICITOUS TACT. Mr Anderson’s Fresco w-as a forcible delineation cf the double character he sustains. His best scene was that in which he frustrates his attempted assassination by the Moor, and converts him to his service. The. next most importani part—that of Verrina—is exactly suited to Mr Vandeab>ff, who gave great force *o the scene where he discovers his daughter’s dishonour and resolves on revenge. Mr EasecyN Moor was sufficiently individualised, without quite embodying
the conception of Schiller:	and the Lenora of Miss L-O'.ici
Addison was effective. The minor characters are very numerate,, and requiring actors of respectable ability They were geocialiv well sustained. THE PLAY WAS W ELL PUT ON TB i: STAGE AS REGARDS COSTUME AND DECORA TIONS. DURING THE PERFORMANCE THE APPLAUSE WAS FREQUENT, ESPECIALLY DURING THE FIRST TWO ACTS AND AT THE END.

Public of witnessing the representation of great German plays in succession with ORIGINAL WORKS OF LIVING DRAMATISTS, may not be altogether unacceptable to the friends of the Drama; while, at the same time they may be brought back from the contemplation of Foreign Talent WITH A NEW RELISH FOR THE UNEQUALLED WORKS OF SHAKSPERE AND ENGLISH DRAMATISTS,

Fiesta was the second of Schiller's flays. The youn£ Germans had become tired of the French c'assical school, and sought refuge in that domestic prose drama of which Diderot, who always influenced Germany more than his own countrymen, wae, in a great measure, the founder. It is unnecessary to give Ihe plot of the drama. The only character highly elaborated is that of Fieseo himself, in which Schiller has closely followed history, and the description of which we may therefore take from Robertson:—“That young nobleman, Fieseo, the richest and most illustrious subject in the republic, possessed iu an eminent degree all the qualities which win upon the human heart, which command respect, or secure attachment
He was graceful and majestic in his person, magnificent even to profusion, of a generosity that anticipated the wishes of his friends and exceeded the expectation* of strangers; of an insinuating; address, gentle manners, and a flowing affability. But, under the appearance of these virtues, which seem to form him for enjoying and adorning social life, lie concealed all the dispositions which mark men out for taking 'he lead in the most dangerous and dark conspiracies, an insatiable and restless ambit on a courage unacquainted with ieer, and a mind that disdained subordination. Such a temper :ould ill brook that station of inferiority wherein he was placed in the republic, and as lie envied the power which the elder Dona had acquired, he was tilled with indignation at the thoughts of it descending like an hereditary possession to Giannettino. These various pa-sions, preying with violence on his turbulent and aspiring mind, determined him to attempt overturning that domination to which be could not submit.”
A version of this play was produced at Drury Lane, on Monday, February 4th. The adaptation was by one of our most skilful dramatists. THE MlSE JSA SCENE WAS HIGHLY LIBERAL AND EFFECTIVE, and the principal character was exceedingly well played bv Mr Anderson, Nothing more could have been done for Fiesco than was done by the several parties who contributed to its production. Fiesco, as we have said, is the principal person. Leonora and Vermin, with their devotion, one to a itusbund, the other to a cause, claim the sympathies of an audience, and the manager did all he could for them by assigning them to Miss Addision and M Vandenhoff.
LET US ADD THAT THE ATTEMPT OF MR. ANDERSON TO INTRODUCE TO THE PUBLIC AN AUTHOR HIGHLY ESTEEMED BY THE LITERARY WORLD. BUT STRANGE TO THE MERE PLAYGOER, IS MOST CREDITABLE TO HIS MANAGEMENT.
The Morning Post
A version of Schiller’s celebrated play of Fiasco ; or, the Revolt of Genoa, was produced last night for the first time in this country.
1 lie intention of the tragedy is as honoura ble as it is zealously expounded. The rabid vices and passions of an uncurbed democracy are laid bare; the self-seeking and glorification of Republicans are drawn with a master hand, and the political benefits and moral blessings ot a constitutional monarchy eloquently insisted upon; and with such a noble purpose many faults oi dramatic skill will be freely pardoned.
Mr. Anderson, as Fiesco, has added greatly to his dramatic reputation. It was carefully considered, and the opposing phases of the character were contrasted with artistic delicacy. There is but. scant opportunity afforded for the exhibition of high wrought passion, but many of the points were given with exceeding power, and his recitation of the allegory of the confusion of the empire of the animals was masterly. The pause at the close, in which he alludes to their choice ot a “ monarch,” was subtlely conceived and admirably delivered.
THE TRAGEDY HAS BEEN GORGEOUSLY PLACED UPON 1HK STAGE, THE SCENERY IS ADMIRABLY PAINTED, AND THE DRESSES ARE RICH AND PICTURESQUE. THE SALOON IN FIESCO’S ^PALACE DURING THE MASKED FETE IS ALMOST WITHOUT A PARALLEL. THE ENTIRE RANGE OF THE STAGE IS FILLED WITH CHARACTERS IN VARIOUS GAY COSTUMES,
THE BACK PORTION OF WHICH IS RAISED AND APPROACHED BY FLIGHTS OF STEPS. HERE ARE DANCERS AND MASQUERS, WHILE IN THE FRONT ARE PAT1ES SEATED GAMING AND DISPORTING IN ALL THE JOYOUS EXCITEMENT OF A R1D0TT0. SHEETS OF PLATE GLASS REFLECT INNUMERABLE GIRANDOLES FILLED WITH LIGHTS. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE SCENE IS AS NEW AS IT IS BRILLIANT AND STRIKING. THE CITY OF GENOA, WITH ITS PALACES AND SEA IN THE PERSPECTIVE, IS ADMIRABLY PAINTED, AND REFLECTS VERY GREAT PRAISE ON THE ARTIST.
We have seldom witnessed a more perfect impersonation
than the Verrina of Mr. Vandenhoff. It was sturdy, and full of natural pathos. The dignity upon taking the vow of vengeance fur the insult to his child, and the vacillation, deep tenderness, and iron resolution of bis last appeal to Fiesco, were each and all ¡city expositions of dramatic art. The character stood out in bold and admirable rebel from the surrounding groups. Mr. Cooper acted the old Doge with commendable dignity, and Mr. Emery, as the Moor, was picturesque and effective.
Miss Laura Addison, as Leonora, fully sustained her deservedly high reputation. The intense love for Fiesco, the glory in his elevation, the fear and the agony lest he should fall a victim to his ambition, were passionately and pathetically' embodied. The scene in which the Marquis de Calcagno pleads his love, and is repulsed was nobly performed. The last interview with Fiesco, in which the contending emotions of pride and anguish seek for mastery, was splendedly rendered
and enthusiastically appended.
Mrs. Ternan, in the character of the Princess, acted with great care, and imparted weight to a part scarcely worthy ot her talent.	■
THE TRAGEDY WAS RECEIVED WITH APPLAUSE.
The Horning Herald.
An English version of Schiller's Fiesco was brought out at Drury Lane, on Monday, February Ith, with great discrimination as regards choice, lor it is well calculated to serve the cause of “ Legitimacy.”
In the preface to this tragedy, Schiller describes his object as being to delineate “ the victim of art and cabal” in opposition to the hero of his play of ihe Robbers, wherein he undertook to portray “ the victim of an extravagant sensibility.” He “ blends
together the MAN and the POLITICIAN, and draws from the refined intrigues of stale situations interesting to humanity."
Schiller has endeavoured to individualise the characters who are grouped together in this drama;-and there is a certain degree of elemental force in the several portraitures. The hero, as the central figure upon whom the action revolves, is described, according to the formula of the author, as “ a young man of dignified pride and majestic affability, with courtly complaisance and deceitfulness,” and these characteristics are well preserved with effective art. Schiller’s sympathies lav-more immediately with the inflexible Verrina, whose maxims of equality and patriotism are couched in phrases of rugged sim plicity; and this worthy more than divides with the gallant
young aristocrat the attention the audience bestow, particularly in the last scene, when the despiser of individual
authority broadly unfolds his political prejudices, and because he cannot make a convert, resorts to violence—as all such demagogues are disposed to do, notwithstanding the plenitud ; of their charity and humanity.
The actors did their best with the blank verse of the adaptor. Mr Anderson declaimed the ambitious »oliquies of the Count with emphatic vigour, and the om nous denunciations of the methodical and implacable Verrina were delivered wit t appropriate weight and gravity by Mr Vandenheff. Mr Cooper, as the venerable duke, was steady and sententious ; and Mr C. Fisher, as his nephew', and Mr Catheart, as the courtier Lomellino, were excellent; in which category may be included Mr Emery, who gave the confessions aud ironies of the reprobate Moor with graphic boldness. The wife oi Fiesco was play ed with earnestness tnd feeling by Miss Laura Addison, whose
intensity of manner invested the scenes of the tragedy in which she was concerned with a pathos which the artificiality of the stage purpose could never of itself have suggested : and Mr, Ternan was an imposing representative of Julia, the haughty princess. THE HOUSE WAS CROWDED.!

Schiller’s historical tragedy, Fiesco: or, Ihe Genoese Conspiracy, was produced on Monday evening at this theatre, the first occasion, as far as we are at present informed, of its performance in this country.
The extreme length alone of the original work would preclude its representation in this country, in the exact form in which the author wrote it; but, with that object in view, excision wa.-even more necessary than compression, as there are scenes in

audience (whose taste, although restricted in range, is so true) however faithfully those passages may accord with the abstract principles of dramatic art. The difficult and dangerous duty ot thus adapting the work of so great a writer has been allotted to one bng skilled in dramatic construction; and MR BLANCHE HAS PERFORMED HIS TASK WITH TASTE AND FELICITOUS TACT. Mr Anderson’s Fiesco was a forcible delineation of the double character he sustains. Hisbest scene wa* that in which he frustrates his attempted assassination by the Moor, and converts himjjto his service. The next most important part—that of Verrina—is exactly suited to Mr Vandenhoff, who gave great force to the scene where he discovers his daughter’s dishonour and resolves on revenge. Mr Emery’s Moor was sufficiently individualised, without quite embodying the conception of Schiller; and the Lenora of Miss Laura Addison was effective. The minor characters are very numerous,

On Monday last, Schiller’s historical play, Fiasco, or, the Revolt of Genoa, was produced at this house in a style ofgrea splendour, and with every sign of elaborate care. The present notice will be brief, as the drama has, in fact, not yet been see in such a manner as to allow justice to be rendered, either U
its merits as an acting play nor to those able artist^who exerted themselves so laboriously in the several leading characters. Fiesco has long been before the reading public in this country, though now for the first time introduced upon the s’age. it ha* recently appeared in the volume of Schiller s works, containing the early dramas and romances,” terming a portion of Mr. Henry S Bohn’s admirable Standard Libran. A translation, indeed, was published so far back as 1796, biff it was very defective. Ano'her came out some eighteen years ago, and a third about nine years since. Mr. Bohn’, version, however is in all respects mosf satisfactory, and, in fact, is the only one which give the tragedy entire.

y-( (. i,/) VRVRY-LAXE THEATRE,
The tragedy of Ion was revived last night with Mr. Anderson and Mr. Yandenlioff in the principal characters. Mr. Anderson, if we remember right, took the part of Ion shortly after the first production of the piece, although it was originally played by Mr. Mac ready. The youth" and extreme gentleness of the young Argive greatly adapt him to a female •artist, and hence Miss Ellen Tree probably made the most impression in the part. In Mr. Anderson’s declamation there was too much monotony, but the art with which he subdued his naturally masculine manner to an almost feminine mildness is much to be commended. Mr. YandenhofT was the original Adrastus, and plays the character admirably; the touches of deep feeling by which the better qualities of the tyrant are revealed to the audience, though concealed from his subjects, being introduced sritli touching effect, and without sacrifice of the fitful temper of the
fillàTIE

I i’filMKN'TARV BENEFIT to Mr. .JAMES ANDERSON.— The performers engaged at this theatre, under the management of Mr. •James Anderson, improved with a conviction of the great services rendered to the interest* of the British drama, and to its professors in general, a.> vre.i as (though more immediately) to their own. by the en-thu.aia.sticspirit which, under circumstances by no means favourable to the success of such experiment, has laboured to restore to the temple of Old Drury, the old worship, too long excluded from its walls, feel desirous of giving expression in some palpable form to their grateful sense of exertions thus directed by individual enterprise. They have therefore unanimously resolved to proffer to Mr. James Anderson, the lessee of the Theatre h /yal, Drurv-lane, their gratuk- u- <ervic s on a night set apart for the express purpose of a complin entnry benefit; and they make thi-offering with the more cordial satisfaction in reciprocity of that feeling of professional fraternity which, under all the pressure of anxious labour inseparable from the heavy responsibility of his undertaking, has throughout presented to them in their manager their brother actor. The Committee for carrying into effect the above resolution beg leave to announce, that the complimentary benefit is appointed to take place on Thursday, the —1st instant, and they appeal with confidence to all friends of the drama for their patronage and support.

ERVRY-LAEE THEATRE,
Fletcher's play of The Elder Brother, although it seems to have been revived with success by the “ King's Company ” " after the Restoration, was soon supplanted by Jam A fakes a Man, or the Rap’s Fortune, a comedy which Colley Cibber fashioned by amalgamating The Elder Brother with The Custom of the Country. This play, which was originally produced al Drury-lane in 1701, remained a stock piece till about 20 years ago.	i
• At present The Elder Brother is more, familiar to the \ theatrical public than Cibber's medley, from the fact that it Was one ox the plays acted a few years since by the body of amateurs, at the head of whom were Messrs. Dickens, Forster, and Jerrold. The principal character is the scholar Charles, who is drawn with singular power, and whose heroism and erudition are favourably contrasted with the less noble qualities of his brother Eustace, a fop. Eustace is the favourite of his father, who wishes Charles, the elder brother,” to resign his birthright in favour of the younger.
The sight of Angellina, the destined bride of Eustace,
’ a new passion in the bosom of the erudite Charles, r he has an object for the employment of wealth,
;o keep his birthright, and carries off Angelllna to Afiramont, a hearty old gentleman, who, though himself, has a great admiration for scholarship, ne difficulties Charles and Angellina are united, a in haring been effected in the character of Eustace.
)t of tliis piece is simple to transparency, and almost 3 force of th3 writing is bestowed on the character s, whose scholarlike attributes are developed by the ith an evident love of the personage. The one uation the piece occurs in the third act, when just on the point of giving away his fortune, ds design before all the other characters through of his sudden love. The comic part of the piece, on the doating passion of Brisac, tne father of » for his servant’s wife, Lilly, is very poor, and was y omitted in the version which Mr. John Forster for the amateurs.
version performed last night at Drury-lane the lay is followed more closely. On the whole it is d. Charles is a.character suited to Mr. Anderson, Iden energy in the third act contrasts forcibly with ;micai calmness that precedes it. Miramont, the . is played with much heartiness by Mr. Emery, denhoff sustained with much good taste the small ngellina, Mr, Montague wa3 a creditable Eustace, Baker did his best with the not very thankful part want Andrew.
• ,A standing the paucity of incidents, the play went off *	- re pleasantly than might have been imagined ; and
1 of the curtain the principal actors were called, sreoii having nearly obtained a similar honour at the e third act, which made an especial impression on nee.

DRURY-LAN t\
The performances at this house commenced with Rowe’s rage Jy of Jane Shore, one of a class of dull and lugubrious Iramas from which managers are wont to select their “ first pieces7 at Easter and Christinas, with the intent, it may be presumed, of whetting the appetite of the holy day visitors for tiro merriment or splendour of the succeeding pantomime, burlesque, or spectacle. On this occasion, however, as on many others, the selection seemed most unpleasing to the gods of the gallery, whose impatience was manifested in so noisy a fashion that the tragedy was per formed, for the most part, in pantomime. The ire of the gallery occupants was then appeased by tlv production of a new fairv drama written and composed by Mr. G. H. Rodwell, called the Deiil’s Ring, a musical and magical drama in three acts and four elements,” and which is one of the most gorgeous and brilliantspectaclesthat has been producedof late vears. The story of the drama may be told in a few words. ' *The Princess Evelim (Miss E. Nelson), the daughter of one Plinee Ottaear, has been, abducted from her paternal home by a wizard, and at the opening of the piece a throng of knights are discovered at an auberge, returning from unsuccessful attempts to ga’n the Devili ring, the possession of which will secure the liberation of the Princess. The ring Can only bo obtained by one who is neither untrue in honour nor false in love, and Herbert (Miss F. ITuddart), a young minstrel, undertakes to achieve the difficult task, despite the jeers of the discomfited knights. In pursuit of his object, -however, it is necessary that he should pass through the four ,' elements,—fire, water, earth, and air, and he has to combat at every step the jealous opposition of the wizard, who is enamoured of his fair pi ize. After passing tl ¡rough the realms . of fire in Mount Etna, making a descent over the great fail of Magar», and undergoing a captivity which threatened to be perpetual in the “ diamond caves of California," Herbert succeeds in overcoming the power of the magician, makeB his way on eagle's wings to the region« of air, and, having rescued the Princess from the Palaces of Rainbows, is united to her with the full consent of her grateful father, the Prince Ottaear. The plot, as is frequently the case in pieces of this nature, is elaborated almost to an extreme, but an opportunity is afforded for the display of some very ' beautiful scenery, and of some now and striking mechanical effects. The comic business re3fcs with Franco (Mr. S. Artaud), a brother of Herbert, who is enamoured of beila (Miss I?after), the Princess's attendant, and who is made an unwilling participator in most of his brother’s adventures, and with Whiriiburg (Mr. Seymour), the sieve of tbs ring, an agile sprite, who exercises a beneficent influence over the fortunes of Herbert. Several songs and duet., arc introduced in the drama, and were sung with much taste an l animation by Miss (Rafter and Miss Nelson, ami in the second act some pretty dancing is executed by the <	,/■ 6 The pies'.
ha3 been evidently got up with the utmost care v ! attention
to the most minute details. Among the scenery, the view ot the City and Harbour of Cutanea, flit City of the Fountains, the view of a Sicilian vineyard, and the last scene—the Hall ofthe Hundred Knights, were specially deserving of commendation, and elicited tuo applause of the audience. The last scene, indeed, where Herbert and his bride make a ti iumpha! entry in u ca" drawn by three real horses, preceded by a grand procession of knights, men-at-arms, and attendant’s, was one of the most gorgeous we have witnessed on the stage.
In the third act the action was somewhat tame, and the interest began in some degree to Sag, but this \ -a - probably
chiefly owing to some unavoidable delay in the “ set” of the scenes, which will he obviated in future representations. We would however, certainly recommend some curtailment ; '	“	'a" combat between Herbert and tho Sable
Knight/' which was ¿0 long protraete! that sibilations pro* ceeded even from those who are supposed to regard sudi encounters, at the transpontine theatres, with peculiar favour.
Mr. Anderson was loudly called for at the close of the performance, and announced the piece for repetition amid generai applause. -

^ , V c PXURY-LAPSF THEATRE.	//><—,
' / • ' ^ 7	------ • -------
Last night a novelty was produced, in the shape of a two-act domestic drama, from the pen of Mr. Bayle Bernard, a gentleman who, a few yeara ago, was as productive in pieces of this class as lie has been more recently in highly ludicrous farces.
The principal characters of the drama are Hartzmann (Mr. Vandenhoff), a merchant and magistrate of Bremen, and his brother Moritz (Mr. Anderson), a felon and a galley-slave. The respectable brother has educated Linda (Miss Vandenhoff), the daughter of the outcast, as his own child, and is peculiarly sensitive as to any revelation that may compromise the family honour. Waldeck (Mr. Cooper), another criminal and the accomplice of Moritz, introduces himself into the family of Hartzmann, as Colonel Rheinberg, and avails himself of his secret knowledge to reveal the story of crime to Linda, to make her believe that her reputed father is the culprit, and to insist on her marrying him, as the only means of bushing up the secret, although a party is assert.bled to celebrate her union with a young lover named Ernest Gellert (W. Montague). When the fatal contract is about to be signed Moritz, the real father, rushes in, solves every difficulty by denouncing Waldeck as a criminal, and then dies, leaving Linda still in the belief that his brother is her father.
The motives of this piece are not altogether new, but the story is skilfully designed, and if the situations had been made to follow sharply one upon another, the result would have been more effective. The character of Moritz, the escaped galley-slave, delighted to behold his child, relieved by her as a mendicant, and never revealing himself, is drawn with much pathetic force ; and the description which ha gives his brother of liis escape from the galleys is one of the powerful passages in the play. The real energy and feeling with which Mr. Anderson acted this part made it effective to its full capacity. The other characters are not remarkably brought forward.
Notwithstanding the cleverness of the plot and the elevation of the language, much of which is written in blank verse, the play has a fault which greatly counterbalances its merits. The dialogue is much longer than is required for the developement of the story and of the personages, and hence the action seems perpetually coming to a standstill. When we repeat that it is in only two acts, call attention to the simplicity of the plot, and add that it lasted three hours, we shall render this proposition self-evident. There was much applause at the end, and the principal actors camo before the curtain, but sounds of opposition were mingled with those of approbation..

The king, or principal actor, only Mitered by the centre, catted ilie ftuy.il .Jour. The scuoiiU character by a smaller <5oor on the right hand side ; and the’third characters by a small door on the left. A t the extremities of the scenes were two doors—that on the right leading to the city through which citizens, &c , entered ;*and that on the left leading to the country, tor strangers, messengers, and such like Thé choruses, orchestra, bacchanals, &e„ were below the stage, t he Greek plays having been written with a view to this arrangement the ancient Greek mode has been adapted to the modern theatre, as far as the same was practicable ; and the Stage will present

Alaiui of Fire at L‘ria ry-lavi. Theatre.—No small excitement was created yesterday afternoon in the
neighbourhood of Drury-lane and the Strand by a sudden alarm that this line theatro was on fire. Hundreds came mailing from all quarters, and the dense body of smoke which surrounded the building seemed to warrant a supposition that the mischievous element had obtained a firm hold of the interior, ft was shortly ascertained that the smoke was proceeding from the roof of the theatre, over the facade, and sparks were observed to rise into the air as if carried by a considerable draught. The mams near the building were at once turned on and messengers were seat to the nearest engine stations to request the prompt attendance of the brigades. The private engine at Combe and Pelafield’s brewery, which is near the theatre, was hastily harnessed to one of their large horses and driven to the spot by several workmen. The West of England engine was soon on the spot, hut the firemen were denied admission to the building. It was evident that every endeavour was being made by those within to extinguish the fire, which was rapidly subsiding, and in the course of half an hour no appearance of it remained, It was stated—but with what troth we know not—that a flue
or chimney first ignited and spread to the woodwork near the roof. The damage done was trifling. The time of the occurrence was about half-past b o’clock. Had it taken place when the audience was within the consequence would m all probability have been very serious, .fyi h, tSqi

Dm: ry- lan f	Tii ]•: atrical Fund.——Yesterday
evening the usual annual festival of this charity took place at the Freemasons’ Tavern, and was remarkably well at-‘ tended. His Koyal Highness the Duke of Cambridge was expected to preside, but at the last moment intimated to Mr. Harley, the treasurer, that he was unable to do so, a3 bis preserv'. was required iu the House of Lords, lathe absence of his Royal Highness the chair was filled by Sir Wyudham Anstrutber, who exerted himself in tho most creditable manner to discharge the duties thu*. cast upon b:m. The amusements of the evening were well sustained by the gratuitous services of many of our most esteemed and favourite
musicians and vocalists; to these were super-added the exertions of Mr. Bacon, the proprietor of the tavern, who pr-> vived the dinner on a scale of unusual splendour. Among the ladies and gentlemen who favoured the company with ; gratuitous performances, were Herr Erii3fc, Miss P. Horton, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Hansford, Miss Fanny Iluddart, Miss M. Aelson, Mr. D. W. King, and M Yivier. The pro £ ■ceedings in a business point, of view were of the usual cha-racier—Mr. Harley in an amusing speech reporting on ’• the progress and prospects of the charity, aud announc* ing subscriptions amounting altogether to about 60CL It appears that at present there are 15 annuitants on the fund, and that in a short time six more are likely ; to be added to the number. Under these circumstances, unless the friends of the charity come to its support, it is anticipated that a redaction of the allowances to annuitants must take place, or the vested capital of the charity must be interfered with. The whole character of the festival maybe described as very successful, if not for the permanent interests of the fund, at least for the amusement of those present, and the hall was graced with a large assemblage of ladies, who appeared to pke a live’y interest in tfcepro-ceilings,	l, i if ST/

1 MRS. GLOVER’S FAREWELL BENEFIT,
A more honourable tribute could riot Lave been paid to an artist than that which was awarded last niglit to Sirs. Glover, when, after an honourable career of more than half a century, she took leave of the public at a theatre opened expressly fo” the purpose. The principal actors of the Hay-market, the Lyceum, the New Strand, and others of great eminence, gratuitously contributed their services, together with many leading vocalists, eo that the programme comprehended the iinames of the day. The crowded state of thci large house immediately after the opening oc the doors
showed the high esteem in which the venerable octree was held by the London public.
Since ZVCrg. Glover acted at the New Strand Theatre she has suffered severely from indisposition, and the enthusiastic greeting which met her from every part of the hous? when she first appealed as Mrs. Malaprop in the liiz-afs was almost too much for her strength. For a while we believo it was feared she would not be able ic get through the part.
I his task she accomplished with some difficulty, but slid w as unequal to that of delivering ?„• farewell address which had been- written for the occasion. Mr. Leigh Murray mala .. an apology, which drew forth the heartiest demonstration-? -of good filing on the part of th 3 audience, and then the curtain rising discovered the “Mot! er of th:? Stage’* • seated iti a chair, surrounded by some of the most illustrious members of the profession. The effect was- tremendous, > The audience burst out into a volley of acclamation •, and tho ' bouquets that were thrown were raised by the younger g artists over the head of their revered colleague. On tha * fall of the curtain the acclamations were renewed, and tha } same we«e once more exhibited with evei greater en-tliuaiafisa.	*
