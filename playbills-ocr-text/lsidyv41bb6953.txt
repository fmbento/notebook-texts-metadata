The Burletta is founded on an Anecdote which appeared in the British Press Newspaper of October last, as foll.ws :—.
" The lirnperor Alexander, on his way to Uijon, stopped at the house ot'ihe Postmaster of a small town in Burgundy.
A Jinnci was prepared for his Majesty, both at the Postmaster's and the Mayor's, who is a wealthy proprietor of Pari*.
The Monaich, who had no time to lose, accepted the invitation of the former. The Mayor, unwilling to lose the opportunity of paying his respects to the Emperor ot Jiufsia, came to address him, and what was, perhaps more agreeable than
his speech, he brought with him his three daughter!, all endowed with extraordinary beauty, and a rare assemblage of pleasing
qualifications. The Emperor invited those ladirs to sit down to table with him ; they icspectfully declined, hut he detained
them till he h\d finished his repast. His Majesty seemed quite em.hanted with one ofthein, who, at the desert, presented
him with a piece of poetry of her own composition : it was a very ingenious trilogy, which made a deep impression on the
Monarch. —Alexander soon afterwards departed, protesting to the younglad) . that he should never cease to retain a pleasing
recollection of her. Three days attcrwards his Majesty smt her an arrow, enriched with diamonds. Unluckily he addreseed
this piesent to the post-house, and the post-master's wife, conceiving tint what was woith receiving was worth keeping,
appropriated ihe jewel to htrself, '1 he Mayor's daughter reclaimed her ii«;ht, the other resisted her demand, and the whole
town was up in arms about the diamond arrow, whieh now became an apple of discord : parties were formed in behalf of
the two claimants. The young persons, who beheld with jealousy the Mayor's daughter eclipse them all, in the eyes ofthe
Emperor of Bussia, hive ranged theinsdves on the side of the post-imstresi, who is old, u<*ly, and ill-tempered. The
mammas, also, who think nobody comparable to their own daughters, arc now caballing against the preferred farr-one,
w.iise cause is espoused by the men alone."

PROSPECTUS.

THE Piece opens with Time perusing a record of ptst events, and contemplating over the departed Heros of Pantomime, who
are distinguished by an emblem of thtir respective protectors or antagonists,by whose aid or fall they ltave gained their popularity.
"lime wishing to revive the mirthful hevo, Havlequin, summons" the Hours, and claims their assistance to complete the task; their
joint ettoits create a n-.w Harlequin,u and he is sent to the house of Pantaloon to woo his daughter: Time displaying an hour-glass,
thus addressing hira :—
This glass shall mark the period of your rout,
u
Your troubles ending when it is runout.'*
Pantaloon ha?, however, destined his daughter for another, and Harlequin arrives at his garden at the moment Columbine is at*
the shrine of Cupid, sueing for a suitor more congenial with her wishes; she graciously receives him, whereby she incurs
the displeasure of her father, Harlequin is about to bear oft" Columbine, but seeing her father and his rival are determined to
foUow, he raises his rival son of mirth, an officious Clown, to baffle thtm in their pursuit. Here the Comic Bu.iness commen.es,
and is Continued through many whimsical situations; Harlequin, in hjs progress, displaying many magical transformation, till the
pe.'iod of his hour arrives, when a general reconciliation is brought about by the " WoltK OF T u n , " ,

0 3 " The very high popularity which " GIOVANNI
IN LONDON"
has obtained, and the more than usual attraction which
attends each successive representation, has encouraged the Proprietor to publish the SONGS, and it is presumed they possess
sufficient merit to engage the publick attention.
It has been erroneously imagined by those persons who have not witnessed
the performance, that it is " a tale twice told," and founded on the old worn-out Piece of' " Don Juan;" it may therefore be
necessary to add, that this DRAMA
begins where the Italian Opera flnishes—that the HERO
and LEPORELLO
are
placed tn situations entirely NOUfELLE—and that the incidents arising from those situations are completely original.

that the incidents arising from tlwsr. situations are entirely

Much inconvenience and perplexity having arisen by Parties not specifying
the exact number of Seats required, at the time of taking Places, the PATRONS,
VISITORS, and FREQUENTERS of this Theatre are most respectfully entreated,
in order to cbviate all difficulties, to give instructions to their Servants to
receive in writing the Number of the Box and the respective Rows taken at
the time of the application, which will be secured until Half-past
Seven
o'clock; after which hour the Box-Keeper cannot be held responsible.
The BOX-KEEPERS have received orders from the Proprietor to appropriate
a limited number of the Private Boxes, not engaged on the Night, for the
public accomodation, at HALF-PAST SEVEN. The immense overflow at a very
early hour occasions this arrangement; which is most gratefully offered.
Some alterations also, have been made in the mode of admitting the audience,
which will give a facility of access to the crowds of Visitors who honour this
Theatre nightly with their presence.
The Private Boxes are carpetted; and the terms of holding them may be
known by application to Mr. Bowes, at the Box-office, from the hour of eleven

After which,

RAMO SAMEE

Will go through the whole of his EXTRAORDINARY FEATS of Strength and Agility; consisting
of various DECEPTIONS W I T H CUPS AND BALLS, wholly different to any* Performance of the
kind.—CHANGING SAND TO DIFFERENT COLOURS ; after which a series of Evolutions with
FOUR HOLLOW BRASS BALLS, the Size of Oranges. His power over them is almost miraculous,
he causes them to describe every possible circle : Horizontal, Perpendicular, Obliquely, Transversally, round his Legs, under his Arms and about his Head in large and small circumferences with
wondrous rapidity, keeping the whole in motion at the same time. This being the grand result of
effort, activity, quickness of the eye, and rapidity of action. No one, who has not witnessed it, can
form an idea of its excellence.—SEVERAL FEATS OF BALANCING, in which he will introduce
the BUILDING A CANOPY W I T H HIS TONGUE, on the TOP of his NOSE, and removing the
same with Surprising Ingenuity.-Also the SPINNING of a TOP on a POINT as fine as aNEEDLE,
and Balancing the same on his Chin ; and in this situation makes it Bow to the Audience while Revolving on the before-mentioned Point, and afterwards, by the Word of Command, restores it to the
same Equilibrium and Steadiness as when first Spun.—The Wonderful FEAT W I T H LARGE
KNIVES, somewhat similar to that of the Balls.—SWALLOWING A STONE THE SIZE OF AN
EGG, and disposing of the same at pleasure.—Afterwards sending a quantity of REAL FIRE from
his MOUTH and NOSTRILS.—Also his manly activity in throwing a LARGE BALL, the Size of
an Eighteen Pound Shot, to different parts of his Frame with the greatest Ease ; he places it between
his Feet, and by giving a sudden spring, throws it over his Shoulder, from whence it alights on the
bend of his Arm, and from thence to several other parts of his Body; but, finally, with a masterly
jerk, throws the Ball round his Head, without the assistance of his Hands.—And several other
ACHIEVEMENTS, too numerous to insert in the limits of this Bill.—He will conclude with
THE EXTRAORDINARY FEAT OF

SWALLOWING

A SWORD

TWO FEE7

k i n d . — C H A N G I N G SAND T O D I F F E R E N T COLOURS; after which a series of Evolutions w.th
FOUR H O L L O W BRASS BALLS. His power over them is almost miraculous, he causes them
to describe every possible circle: HORIZONTALLY, PERPENDICULARLY, OBLIQUELY, TBANSVURSELY,
round his Legs, under his Arms and about his Head in large and small circumferences with
wondrous rapidity, keeping the whole in motion at the same time. This being the grand result of
effort, activity, quickness of the eye, and rapidity of action. No one, who has not witnessed it, can
form an idea of its excellence.—SEVERAL FEATS OF BALANCING, in which he will intioduce
the B U I L D I N G A CANOPY W I T H HIS T O N G U E , on the T O P of his NOSE, and removing the
same with Surprising Ingenuity.-Also the SPINNING of a T O P on a POINT as fine as a N E E D L E ,
and Balancing the same on his Chin ; and in this situation makes it Bow to Jhe Audience while Revolving on the before-mentioned Point, and afterwards, by the Word of Command, restores it to the
same Equilibrium and Steadiness as when first Spun.—The Wonderful F E A T W I T H LARGE
K N I V E S , somewhat similar to that of the B a l l s . — S W A L L O W I N G A STONE T H E S I Z E OF A N

his M O U T H and NOSTRILS.—Also his manly activity in throwing a LARGE BALL, the Size of
an Eighteen Pound Shot, to different parts of his Frame with the greatest E a s e ; he places it Between
his Feet, and by giving a sudden spring, throws it over his Shoulder,* from whence it alights on the
bend of his Arm, and from thence to several other parts of his Body; but, finally, with a masterly
jerk, throws the Ball round his Head, without the assistance of his Hands.—After several other

It is most respectfully mentioned to the Public,
that this Theatre has, for several Seasons, been under
very unsuitable Management; but the Estate has, by
Purchase, become the Property of a new Proprietor, well
experienced in Theatrical Management; and who, many
years, conducted the Sans Pareil Theatre, and brought
it to its high state of celebrity. An immense sum has
been expended in Improvements, and the New Proprietor has the greatest confidence that when the Public
are a little better acquainted with this Theatre, it will
become a great favorite, and frequently receive the
Overflow of the two Patent Theatres, being situate at
the bottom of Drury Lane, in Wych Street, and within
less than Five Minutes Walk of either of them; and the

Cymon, the Idiot Heir of a neighbouring State, beguiles him to her Court, the mist of imbecility is dispelled and Cynion regenerated, braves the power
with thr hope of inspiring him with a reciprocal passion, but her efforts are ren> of the Enchantress and fulfils Merlin's prophecy, that - Cymon's cure shall be
dered vain by the mental imbecility of the Prince, and theMarhinations of Urganda'- wound." The Enchantress in revenge transforms the Prince into
