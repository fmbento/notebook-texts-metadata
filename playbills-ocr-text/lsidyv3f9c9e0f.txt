DHITRY-LAVE, Nov. 23. A Comic Dance, called “ Love in a Tub,” was performed fertile first time. Tlie incidents are most of them comic contrivances, through which an amorous old cooper is thrown into droll situations by a pair of younger lovers. The dances are pleasing and appropriate ; and the manner in which they are conducted reflects much credit on Mr. D’Egville, who prepared them. The music is the composition of Mr. Bishop. It is perfectly adapted to the character of the scene, and is remarkable at once fdr simplicity and science.

1 This drama seems taken from a French piece called La Victim Cioitree, which some years since was represented at one of the Paris theatres, and had an uncommon run: and is said to have been adapted to the English stage, by Mr. Lewis, author of The Castle Spectra,Sic. The writer has bestowed much attention on the part allotted to Ellistou ; and he sustained it throughout in a manner creditable to his industry and talents. Mr. II. Siddous, in lienvo-lio, played with spirit; the passage, “ Tis bat too often the lot ol man to encounter calamity; hut ’tis his duty to hear it with patience,” he gave finely, and was repaid with two distinct peals of applause. Mrs. II. Siddons, in the little she had to perform, exhibited her usual good sense and just feeling ; but she was not seen until the last act; when, like i’yramus and T'hisbe, the two lovers find a wail interposed between them. Mr. Elliston, however, breaks through the wall, and discovers bis mistress. It may be easily conceived, that this mode of bringing about the denouement could not fail to have a very ludicrous effect. There is no humour in any of the characters ; though something like it seems to have been intended for Air. Peuley and Mrs. Sparks, who d,d thair best to contribute to the suc-
cess of the piece. The Scenery is very fine, and there is much taste and sweetness in the music occasionally introduced. A beautiful trio was sung in the first act by Mr. Smith ar.d the two youths who were heard to so much advantage in the SiezeofSt. Quintm. It was deservedly encored, and much applauded. The house was pretty full; and the piece seemed upon the whole to be received .with approbation; the only displeasure signified being in the last act.
Coveist Garden Company (At the Little Theatre, Haymarket), Dec. 5. The Covent Garden Company this evening commenced their operations in Mr. Colman’s theatre, with The .Vounlain-eers; to which was added a new Farce in three acts, called “ A School for Authors;” the principal characters of which were thus represented :

This very pleasant farce, wp understand, was written by the late Air. Tobin, auihor of The Honey Moon. The story turns on a London citizen, who, having removed lot dwelling from the Minories to the west end of the town, and become an author, has written a tragedy called Guy Faux, and it is presented to one of the winter theatres : the author prevails upon Cleveland, the lover of liis niece, if it should not succeed, to father his unfortunate production. At the same tunc, this lover had written a comedy, which was to be performed at the other theatre on the same night. The author of Guy Frier has prevailed ot\ a critic (Wormwood) to read liis play, and introduces the lover of his niece as the author of it. Wormwood, supposing the old gentleman to be of opinion that the pieee would not succeed, employ* several persons for the purpose of hissing it; among whom is Frink, a lale servant of the old citizen, whom lie had discharged for stealing the manuscript of the pUy, and leading it to his fellow-servants: the play is accordingly damned, and that written bv the niece's lover succeeds. In consequpncy, the old gentleman gives his consent to the niece's marriage with Ler lover, and turns the critic out of dcois.
The piece went off wilh much eclat. Munileu, who had the principal pari, displayed his talents to great advantage; in (act, we never remember him more

In effecting this tfenouemeut^ great asMstance is deriven from O’D^dumTS, who, under the appcarafice of craft, is a generous -	'
fellow, liai ussuracd the character of a knave, to counteract t lie viliany of his client.	(
The obstacle to the Onion of Helen and “* * Charles being thus removed, the two lovers are made happy.
This comedy is the avowed production of S. J. Arnold, Esq. who had before produced some afterpieces which were -favourably received ; and who has good reasoh to be pleased with his success in	-
the present instance. The characters ‘	^
are strongly marked? and well discriminated; though we think that of Sir : j \ * Rowland open to some objection; as “ ** his crime is of too deep a cast for the cognizance of Hie comic muse. Indeed, the piece is rallier a sentimental novel * dramatized, than a comedy. To the dialogue we can give our praise, with very few exceptions. It contains much wit; not „forced, hut naturally arising from situation ami character. Eut nei- r*>r^•-tiier of the double discoveries at tije close (the real instead of I he sham ; \ marriage, or the exchange of the clol- . dren) are new: the former is evidently from '/he Vicar oj Wakefield.
The performers exerted themselves . gTeally on the occasion; particularly Mrs. Jordan, Mrs. H. hiddons, Messrs. Dowtou,’Johnstone, Mathews, and Eliis-	. \
ton. VNe did nut hear throughout the piece a single dissentient voice; when ,	’
~tbe% curtain fell, the hoasc resounded-------------
wilh three distinct peals of applause ; and when the piece was given out for a second representation, these applauses were repeated.

Captain Dashwond...... Air. Ki.i.jston.
Jîelville...............Mr. Hoiuvb.
Air. Oakdale...........Mr. Dowton.
Sfiutilebag........... Mr. Matt,!! i \vs.

Alos Oakdale...........Miss	Bovcr.
AJaid..................Mrs. Hakiowf.
Captain Dashwood, flying from London into M ales, to avoid the consequences of a pecuniary demand made upon him by a usurer in possessionof his bond tor two_ thousand pounds, is entertained in the hospitable " family of Mr. Oakdale, a wealthy citueu retired, and-whose daugliter is mtrnded Cep Young BelvilJe, the neptiew of the usurer, Shuffle bag. Now, m consequence of e. letter written by the niiscr, Oakdale takes the iaplani for Bel ville in disguise, and refuses to encourage the addresses of the real nephew , of ShutHebag when he presents bim-elf. Mis-takeupon mistake succeed* upon this ground, . nil the usurer coming down with a hmlilFto arrest Dashwoori, an éclaircissement takes place : and the union of Oakdale's daughter and Belville toliows of course; when the lady finds, in her intended husband, the man . cl her own particular choice.
There is in this farre a great deal of stage-effect, drollery of character, and rapidity of business ; and, with the admirable acting by which it is supported, it has had a great rup, and promises to be a permanent favourite with the town.
Feb. 13. A Mr. Kyley, from the Liverpool theatre, made his first appearance on this stage, as Sir Peler Ten Je, iu The School for Scandal. Prohabit arising from a fear of overstepping the line of correctness, his performance appeared to us to he deficient in spirit and humour; it wanted most of those delicate yet effective trails of the character, by the force of which poor King acquired immortal fame in the part.
Mr. Ryley, however, seems a sensible man ; and perhaps may appear with better effect in some other character; as wc understand he has obtained a considerable share of provincia] celebrity.
I eb. 14.—Tbisevcning, between the play ami farce, a Monody upon the Jleat b of the late lamented Gcucral bir John Moore, was ably delivered by Airs. Powell, and much applauded. If issaid to be a hasty production, for the occasion, by Mr. M, G. Lewis; and has been several limes repeated.

THEATRICAL JOURNAL.
DESTRUCTION OF DRURY-LANE THEATRE BY FIRE!!!
WE had the painful task of announcing in our last number (p. 145) the complete destruction of this magnificent edifice; on thecrection, improvement, and decoration of which so much labour, ingenuity, and expense have been bestowed; we have now to add some particulars of this lamentable event.	-
The flames first broke out next Brydges-street, in the coffee room on the first tier, immediately over the lounge, or lobby. The engines, although instantly sent for, could not reach the scene of destruct.on in time to give effectual assistance. It was nearly half past eleven before they could he brought to work, and at that period the violence of the flames was irresistible. The figure of Apollo, at the top of the theatre, felt down with a tremendous crash, in about a quarter of ap hour after thediscovery of trie dames; and the most serious fears were entertained for all the houses situated in Vinegar-yard, Wobnrn-court, and the adjacent passages. The inhabitants began to remove their most valuable effects; but soon found it impossible to carry their wishes into execution, in consequence of the multitudes of people that crowded from every quarter of the metropolis.
When the fire was first discovered in the interior of the theatre, several attempts were made to extinguish it; but it had completely identified itself with the wood, and in less than five minutes after the entrance of Mr. Johnston, the machinist, who, residing close to the bouse, was one of the first that witnessed the progress of the flames, the boxes, pit, and stage were covered with fire and smoke. A few papers and accounts were taken from the treasury with great difficulty and danger. All efforts were in vain to preserve a single vestige of the interior of the bouse. The multitude assembled on the occasion amounted to many thousands. The flames were v isible to a vast extent, frpra the commanding situation of the theatre, and of course attracted crowds in every direction. Rus. sell-street, Drury-lane, Catherine-street, Brydges-street, Charles-street, Bow-slfect, 'i’avBtotk.street, Long-acre, and
Covent-garden, were absolutely filled with spectators, such was the force of the conflagration, that its heat was very strongly felt at the church in Co veil t-garden, and at the bottom of Catherinestreet, in the Strand. It is esteemed a fortunate circumstance by some, that there was no performance at the theatre on that evening (being a Friday in Lent); while others think that, had there been an audience in the house, the alarm would have been so instantly ¡¿iven, as to lead to the almost immediate extinction of the flames.
We regret to stale, that the solidity of the walls, upon which the architect and tlie managers placed the most confident reliauce, failed, and they gave way. Shortly after one o’clock the chief part of the fronts in Russell and Brydges-streets fell in with a horriblo crash; and before two, the side in Vinegar-yard fell with a dreadful noise. It turns out, that the edifice was erected upon timber piers, cased with brick, and faced with white cement. The destruction of the whole building is of course easily accounted for.
About twelve o’clock intelligence of the conflagration reached the House of Commons, and the fire wasdistinctly visible from the gallery windows. Several of the members quitted the House, and went upon Westminster-bridge to view the flames, which, from that point, presented a spectacle more terrific than any that has been witnessed in ttiis capital since the great fire of 1656. Mr, W. Elliott and Lord Temple suggested the propriety of an adjournment, in consideration of the great personal calamity which the House had just been informed had befallen a right honourable gentleman (Mr. Sheridan), for whom every one must feel. Mr. Sheridan, in a low loDeof voice, and evidently much affected, said, he did not think the misfortune which had happened to himself was of a proper nature to interrupt the proceedings of the House. This sentiment was with difficulty acquiesced in, and the debate proceeded,
Those who recollect how beautiful and conspicuous an object the theatre appeared from the bridge, may form some conception of the awful picture it exhibited, glowing in every part with ignited matter. The conflagration cast
Theatrical Journal,	22#
so strong a light on BlackCriars-bridge, that a gcnLleman upon it was able at twelve o’clock to read a small print of an advertisement in a newspaper!
“ The insurance offices” have not suffered so materially as was erroneously stated in most of the papers. The fob lowing, we understand, is an exact statement of the amount of the sums insured on the- theatre, at the respective fire offices:
i The British.... 5,0001.
Imperial....... 13,5001.
Hope___________ 10,0001.
Eagle ........ 6,5001.
35,0001.
It is evident, that the above sum must he inconsiderable indeed, in comparison with the extent of the injury which this deplorable event has occasioned, and which amounts to near 300,0001.!!
After Mr. Sheridan had arrived at the fatal spot from the House of Cuuunous, and it was evident that no human exertion could rescue this favourite scene of “ harmless pleasure” from Ihe fury of the devouring element, hewas prevailed upon to adjourn to the Piazza coffeehouse ; where he received every possible attention from the proprietors, and was consoled as feelingly as the case would admit by many private friends, amongst whom were the Duke of York and Lord Mountjoy.
Mr. Sheridan acted with astonishing fortitude. He said—“The accident is what we are all liable to; that may be remedied: but it is not in ray power to save numbers, who, from a privation of their accustomed employment, are menaced with inevitable ruin. My only gonsolation is, in witnessing the attachment and exertions of my friends; and in the reflection, that, so far as 1 hare been enabled to collect, no lives have been lost,” i
The extraordinary circumstance of two national theatres, and a royal palace, having been all on fire within the space of the last five months, reudered Conjecture very busy, and afforded ample employment for Rumour and her hundred tongues. Wetrust, however, that the misfortune is solely attributable to accident; as it is said to be owing to some plumbers, who had been at work that dav, and who, if true iu this instance, have occasioned, by their culpable ueg. ligcnce, tbe injury and destruction of three national edifices, vis. Westminster-abbey rnugli defaced!—Cqvenl-gar-
den church burnt!—Drurj-lanc Theatre burnt!
Thus has been demolished a structure which, built at an amazing expense, and conducted upon a magnificent establishment, has not lasted more than fifteen, or sixteen years. As Dr. Johnson remarked upon the death of his friend Garrick, the accident may truly be said tohave “ eclipsed the gaiety of nations;’* and fully bears out the moralist's assertion, that “ our pains anj our pleasure* are nearly allied.” The destruction of our places of amusement by fire is very remarkable; and we believe none have escaped but Column's theatre, the Lyceum, Sadler’s Wells, and the Royalty.
The loss of the performers has of course been very considerable. Nothing was saved from the flames, excepting the book accounts of the theatre, and some property of Messrs. De Camp, Russell, aud Matthews, and of Airs. Jordan.
Among the articles which Mr. Sheri, dan has lost, and which he most dearly prized, were, two piano-fortes, formerly telougiug to the late Mrs. Sheridan, and for one of which he had been offered 10001. which he refused to take; a very valuable clock, which stood between the green room and the private boxes, formerly the property of Mr. Garrick, which was worth 7001. and which required winding up but once a year; an organ, which stood on the stage, of Handel’s, worth 8001. and tbe whole of Air. Sheridan’s magnificent furniture, which was conveyed thither when Mr, Sheridan left Somerset-house.
Next to the injury which Mr. Sheridan will suffer, is that which befals Mrs. Richardson, widow of the late Joseph Richardson, Esq. and her four daughters; whose sole dependence was on a quarter part of the theatre, of whid\ they were proprietors.
Mr, Matthews, Mr. Russell, Mr. De Camp, and Mr. Pcnley, the performers, were at the house of Richard Wilson, F.sq, in Lincoln’s-inn-fields, when the alarm was given of the theatre being in flames They all started together. The three first werejuslin time to save some of their properties. Mr. Penley arrived only to see his dressing-room enveloped in lire,
It has been said that the reservoir was empty of water. This is not true, A fireman belonging to Ihe British, of the name of White, had-the care of it; and but two daJ* before, he bad in-
The air leaf Journal.
«pected the premises, the engine, pipes, plugs, aud buckets, and they were all in order.
The rapidity of the flames was unexampled. As soon as it reached the front boxes, it ran.along like a train of powder. Tliis was owing to the serv dry oil paint of the fronts. From the b ixes it communicated to the fly-wings of the Stage, and thus spread one universal tor-re ;t of fire over the » hole hollow extent of the theatre. If the walls had been a »olid mass of masonry, hkc the Albion Stills, the fire r buhl, in all probability, fiavc been hin ted to the area; but the building, as we have slated, wav a timber carcase, nogged and ftced with brick ; 90 that when the fire reAcheJ the beam-ends, the casing gave way, and piece after piece was precipitated to I he ground.
The late theatre opened under the management of Mr. Kemble, on Wednesday, March 13, 1714, with a selection of oratorio music. The performers were, Storace, Mrs. Crouch. Master Walsh, Mr. Harrison, and Mr. Meredith, of Liverpool, who made his first appearance in Loudon. Among the Company at theopenirg were, the Priace of Wales, Mrs f ilzberberf, Priace William of Gloucester, the Duke of Portland, and the Duchess of Gordon.
The first dramaticrepreseutatioa took place on Easter Monday, the '¿1st of April, 17 94. The play was .Va beth, and Mr. C. Kemble made his first appearance as Malcolm ; Lady MucbciH by Mrs. Siddons. Mr. Kemble spoke an occasional prologue; and Miss Far-rco, the present Countess of Derby, aa epilogue, in the character of the housekeeper of a mansion opened for show . After describing the merits of the New Dnirv, she admonished the audience to res.st'alarms from fire, for the managers fould drown than in a minute. 5he also mentioned the iron curtain, which would save from fire

The curtain was then drawn up, to shew a piece of water i.d the stage filled from the reservoir or. the roof of the theatre. \ bridge was thrown over the wafer with an arch; and a man rowed in a boat under the arch, while the music played “ The jolly young Waterman.1* The iron curtaiu was jfierwardidropped fa join's, and the stage was completely sepaiatW! from the audience.

CoVEJTT-GARDEV CoWPASY (at the
F/ay mar Let heal re), March 9.—A Comedy from the pi n c.f Mr. Ai-myghaw, colled “ list ievpfvcf; or, The Trustee," was presented for the first time : it experienced, however, such a reception, as renders it unnecessary for us to say much respecting its merits or demerits.
'Thestory is constructed altogether of worn-out common-place materials.— An adopted boy falls in love with the daughter of bis patron ; and a younger brother seeks to possess himself of Iho estate which properly descends to the elder, by representing him as deaJ, &cv which nefarious act is as awkwardly planned, as it is clumsily prevented being carried into effect—The attempt of the author which is deserving of most credit is, that of delineating character ; in which, however, he has only given a little novelty of colouring to some old family-pictures.
The acring was admirable; the exertions of M unden, Emery, Fawcett, Liston, Mrs. H. Johnston, Mrs. Davenport, and others, warded off the wrath of the audience till towards the close of the performance ; when it was loud, and we thought decisive} the piece, hew.

fable.
The story of pieces like the present is scarcely worth tracing; and, if remembered, is rarely entitled to a record.—The marriage-cervmoiiies of “ The Circassian Bride” are interrupted hv an incursion rrf li e Tartars ; and, through l lie treachery oi a jealous rival, •both the parties to the spousal are made prisoners. An English party is mtrediiced into File piece, Slot under very probyhle ctrtuia-.stances ; but, as they aid the pyipose of the piece, usage must sanction the improbability. The husband, Alexis, being rescue,d by some ol his own party, under the guidance of Blunt, an English seaman, assumes the disguise of a blind minstrel, in order to redeem his wife from her captivity. In that capacity he is engaged by the Tartar chief, tossoften, by the power of music, the obstinacy of his fair captive. The minstrel is detected, but escapes. After a number of similar adventures, the Circassians become triumphant; the married pair are released, and a grand chorus celebrates the fultihueut of their nuptials.'
From this sketch, our readers will perceive, that there is no novelty in the plot, and that it is allied to llichurd Caeltr da Lion, Lodoislta, and other pieces. 1 In truth, the only recommendation of the piece is its music, by Mr. Bishop, particularly the overture, which is a grand composition; and several good songs are given to Braham, Mrs. Bland, Mrs. Mountain, Miss Lyon, and others.—The characters intended to be comic are such as Bannister and Mathews, with all their acknowledged talents, appeared incapable of making auy thing of; and the dialogue is very weak. The audience, toward the close of the performance, became so much out of humour, that the actors found it prudent to retire behind the curtain without singing the Finale.—Much good scenery and some elegant dresses have been bestowed upon this production; which if brought forward again, it should be in the reduced form of an afterpiece.—The theatre was extremely crowded ; and it was with difficulty the opera was announced for repetition.
[ We stop the press to announce, that, on the following night, (Feb. 24) this very magnificent Theatre teas wholly destroyed by fire.—The particulars must be deferred till our next.]

Prev ious to the performance, Mr. Elliston delivered the following Address, which ■had been written for the occasion by Mr. Eyre, a respectable actor in the company :	*
Oft have you seen, upon the silver tide,
A floating bulwark, Britain'« guard and pride, With tow'ring masts, that ages might dtly, (Those naval pillars of her victory),
With gaudy streamers, and with suds unfurl’d, Looking defiance on the wat’rv world!
Her crew, as hardy as the rocks that brave The bold invasion of the furious wave,
^Vith dauntless valour, send on ev’ry breeze Those sounds of triumph—“Britain rules the Seas’.”
Yes, on her foes, tier vengeance she can pour,
Tint who can still the elemental roar?
What voice can calm the ocean's dreadful .sound,
When winds sing out the sailor’s dirge around? Or when, by lightning struck, the ship displays
The double horrors of the fun’ral blaze 1 The crew, desponding, leave the burning deck.'
And turn, with anguish, from the sinking wrick !
Thus, our stout vessel, whose stupendous height
Shone with the radiance of Apollo’s light.* Which erst had stood the man v hostile blows, The awful thunders of our critic foes,
Goes now dismantl’d—-cast aw ay—and bum’d, And t!I her trophies into ashes turn’d 1
Whilst tee, the ship-wreck’d manners, were tost
Upon tiie world’s wide sens, and nearly tost} But hope, that steady pilot of the soul,
Took lo this life boit, and preserv’d the whole; Bore iH in safety to the friendly shore, Where kind protection open’d wide this <ioor,t Offer'd a shelter to thesuff’rmg crew,
Whose future welfare must depend on you;
[To the audience.
Yout* lih’ral aid must lie’p us to refit.
And arm the muses for the war of wit; Whilst we, the champions of the poet's
cause,
Will study to preserve the drama’s laws,
And gain t he meed of merit—your applause.

Drvry-lane Com pa if y ,	the Ly-
ceum), June 1ft.—The late Drtiry-Jane Company concluded their season at this theatre, with The Beirut Law, Bfue Devils, auj ¡Tie Mayor af Garrgtt. At the end of the comedy, *5r. Wroughton advanced to the frout of the stage, aad address'd the house as follow*;
* Ladies and GtMfantih
“ This last nigh! of performance demand», nnr annual address of thanks—but so peculiarly involved in calamity as ihv performers have 'been, lrom the destruction ol‘ both, theatres this winter (which was near reducing' many of the adherents of the sta je to uncom- _ mon difficulties and distress), we are anxiously apprehensive lest our t^prttesibBs prove inadequate to our feelings on thisoccasion. The calamity, which was. truly gtievous to onr brethren of Coveut Garde?! theatre, became trebly so to the Drury-laite company ; for where, in the first instance, some relief could be administered, in the latter scarcely any could be obtained. Hopeless and dreary was our situation for some weeks, until our appe.il to the Earl of Dartmouth, the Lord Chamberlain, who graciously listened t» onr distress, and with the utmost kindness (wlii^h must ever be remembered by the actors) gave us ins sanction and permission to come forward on onr own account; and from the liberality of the public, and the kind intervention of the proprietors of the Opera House and the Lyceum, we have, in some measure« thus far sustained our misfortunes.
" By your generosity we have been ena- ’ bled to keep united , and we again lock forwards with confidence, in the hope of a coutinuat.cn of public favour; assuring you, that wherever our future destiny shall place us, we trust oar exertions, keeping pace with our gratitude, will render us deserving of your attention.
L now remains for us, at the conclusion of the season, to offer our heartfelt tritium of i hanks, winch we one and all beg Jeate thus publicly aod respectfully to present to our pations and bene actors, for that pro-te« turn, that indulgence, and that nohie hbt> rality, with which they have followed up and rewarded our bumble endeavours.”
