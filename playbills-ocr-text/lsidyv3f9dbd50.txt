HBATRE ROYAL, DRUIIY-LANE.—
icn ^r* F’JFl SMITH tenders his rocM-t sincere thanks to the Nobility,
Ctentnr, and Public, for the constant and liberal patronage extended to him da ring the past three «caaons of hia management. The Manager looks back with ¿ride and delight upon the sucmh»» of his humble efforts ;% , jW oa<fr for the Public, whom he now from experience finds will support" any deserving amusement offered at a moderate price, and wjspectably' fS eondueted, a sueceaBion of which In every variety of form it will be his * constant effort to produce. On Mr. K.T. Smith entering upon the manage-meot of this vast establishment hi? utter failure was most kindly and plentifully predicted. Six week« was the limit allowed	for	his Lessee-
amisT9* dlirin? wWch, brUif Porio(J th«I »*K0ly calculated	he	would have
¥ If JC	fi ll	I vr0/01^ ,ly T??.rntA1* W*I 0VL‘r th0 hu*® *>jildinff. and at	the	termination
• m wMRp	**	**	* ’s»e round availing himself of the aoqoircd knowledge by using	the door for	*
a rapid egress. Previous successive failures were the only groundwork for the propheay. Preceding and hlghly-talented Managers had ever entorod those walls ovcrwhuiiuod with enormous and unnecessary expenses, which had from time Immemorial been imposed npon ah **** lessees, and who were too much engaged in their professional capaeliy na actors to look Into the minor details o; economy. Mr. E. 1.
Smith having noticed the consecutive downfall« of these gentlemen from the sent, of government, instead ot adopting the usual maim gerial coarse at following in the wako of his predecessor*, availed himself of the lesson taught, and pursued exactly the opposite course. 1 »stead o 1 throwing himself back In the vehicle and allowing others to drive him *ie jumped upon the box. took the reins in his own hands, and foolish ’though it uppearod to others, drove himself. The carriage happily p far runs on its wheel» In Drury«lane, instead of being in Basing-All-street under repuir, with the two trout one« oft. Mr. K. T Bmith •aw that Ids first endeavour should bo directed towards frugality,
•na narrowly looked into every item of expenditure from the Scene-room to the coal-cellar, which, although it created much disapproval from the long employed functionaries, was found in the end to bo pra/fcrablo to reckless trading and non-payment. In the second *«e«iiou the Manager wua enabled to launch out more boldly, and In the Wiird one, just completed, still more so. graced by the production of an Sf » approved and profitable Pantomime, ami the first placing upon the English boards of Meyerbeer's Justly-celebrated Opera of “L'Etoile du Nord,"

TALENT FROM ALL QUARTERS
Acting Manager,
his well-known fitness for which requires no comment.
The able sen iocs of
MR. ROBERT ROXBY
-have been ««cured to till the reaponsihla office of
Stage Manager.
ilfr. C. Mathews will l»c supported by several talented public favourites, * 'iwh»»e names will shortly be announced; and In order that the «mt- e*

■wishing for eneagemente should apply at once, as many of the arrangements arc already in vapid course of progress. Mr. L. V. Smith In this elaborate announcement will doubtless be charged with egotism, but so long as he carries out what he promises and receives the approval of the Public it matters nothing what zealous rivalry may say. In ponflessiun of one of the finest efcages in the world, the management fears not competition. Mr. W. J. Hobson, the author of Lore and Loy ii/y. and other writers of the first oMre, are engage»! to write modern pieces suited to the tastes of the nineteenth century. Mr. K. T. -Smith eschews the notion of playing long by-gone five act heavy plays simply because they form items in the category of what is termed “ Legitimate," nor will he entirely food his patrons upon French cookery, but give them good Jhonest English fare, accompanied with savoury entries.
Having thus provided for completeness in every department behind the •curtain, it is neeesnary to observe thnt at the same time numerous aUora-tions and improvements will be made in the audience portion, wliioh will fye under the personal superintendence of
MR. E. T. SMITH.
The whole of the interior will be
THOROUGHLY CLEANED AND RE-DECOR ATE D,
while» the public and private boxes will be rendered more convenient. „ limbec*' number of stalls only will be permitted, in order to prevent any jw viiMhxt t ’toeroachmetit upon the space allotted for the pit,
THE BOX OFFICE will remain, ua heretofore, under the charge of Mr. dun terton.
NO FEES TO BOX-KEEPERS
will be pen nitted, and programmes of the performance will be gratuitously presoldod to each visitor.
THE SALMON will be remodelled entirely, and rendered available for the Dr«»« Clr» ‘le, and all comestibles, Ac., will bo of the very best quality, at moderate an d fixed charges.
The redneed tariff of prices for admission will be continued, viz., Private llosce«, One, Two, and Three, Guineas each; Press Circle, 4s.;

AN ORIGINAL EGYPTIAN PLAY.
The early ages of ligypt are lost in dirk mysten’: the most learned antiquaries have not been able to hand them down to us with any degree of certainty, especially those great events, which, doubtless, manifested themselves long before the sovereignty of the Pharoahs. A period, if wc may judge by the «till existing wreck of material things equal to, if not surpassing in grandeur and magnificence of conception, the boasted works of our own enlig
lightened times !
Herodotus speaks little of “ Nitocris ” beyond associating with her name and reign the completion of the third pyramid.
Other writers
of antiquity differ materially in their historical accounts, both as regards her sovereignty, and her mi-mage. That she was a powerful Queen of Egypt'.« well attested by the hieroglyphics on variousjwrecks of art still existing. Some have assigned to her an Egyptian husband; others \
iuT'Athenian—a noble slave or captive, with whom it is affirmed she became so desperately enamoured as to elevate him to the highest position in the state. Out of this circumstance arose those startling incidents emanating from national and ministerial jealousies love, ambition, implacable revenge, which the author has caught at, as most likely to produce in scenic representation the most intense and moral interest. Still deviating as slightly as possible, if at all, from truth; rendering the picture wore truthful by the unquestionable authority of its manifold and magnificent appointments. No pains have been spared—no expense has beeu considered too great*—no research too trying, if order to present a strictly accurate picture of the history, habits, manners, and customs of the Pharaonic period; and that nothing may he found wanting to give completeness o its
{reduction, the piece will be sustained by the highest dramatic talent, and illustrated by artistic and mechanical effects of entirely novel construe. on.
[erodotus, Denon Wilkinson, the Libraries of the British Museum, and Imperial Museums at London and Paris, together with other authorities, have been carefully consulted to insure the most rigid correctness in all the details and appointments, and in thus reviving the association of a people that existed upwards of Four Thousand years ago, it is hoped that the stage will present a combination of amusement and instruction.

G <1	- DRUR * -LA:'S THEATRE. /n
Fo Lather more than a t rv^h fecionth the observant 'My fsTcrri the London street must Lave remarked in -undry place a mysterious placard, the infceriptnn on which was
compged solely of those hieroglyphics th^t form the con-staniornament of Egyptian sarcophagi, Not a word in any Eurt^¿an language was added in explanation of the enigma, fli-d he passenger could only look and wonder, without fcVorpretsudiug to unravel.
Ec rather more than a month past the game placard ha-, Bppered, with an elucidatory appendix, showing that it refered to the opening of Drury Lane for dramatic purposes u tis pre?ent month of October, and that the mystic charades predicted the forthcoming of ‘.n Egyptian drama, to
he e titled Aiie-v’s Learned infer •nation, in large type, wasikewiee afforded gratuitously to the public, who were ii.fo iled that Herodotus, Deuon, Wilkinson, the libraries :f to Eritfsh Museum, and the “ Imperial libraries of Lonon aud Paris,” had all been consulted to render the appiiaching wonder a model of antiquarian accuracy.
Tib ruling passion of a sight-seeing public is curiosity, (.cd^accordiugly. when Drury Lane opened last night with
iiV.unc drama, Nitocris, the house was crammed to a degre that was quife as marvellous as anything promised ia tho daybiUs. Ii'.< pcdt flu udm—it .a sufficient to :3v. tfiafcehortly after the com men cement of the even-' ag there was sarcely good standing room at the back of the dress cue! from which a -atisfactory view of the stage could l?
0	nnanded.
A.;ong the riddles uttered in private society it has often occured that a vary promising problem has been solved by •v vey pointless answer. We regret to state that this has
1	c-enfche case with the huge riddle of the London streets, Ever body, on the faith of those tremendous placards, preset! to Drury Lane . everybody, whou the entertainment, had cached its close, went home grievously disappointed.
Le us begin at tae beginning. Who and what was Is itcria ?
Hrodotus in his Euterpe (c. 10ft), tells us cf an Egyptian Quen named Nitoeri», who wa* (raised '.to the tfcrons aftetuG murder of tho Ling, her brother, by hie subjects. Altbugh the profited by the crime, she was determined to ptmih the criminals, and accordingly she prepared u large fcubtrranean room to which fcheinviredtho.se who were most guilfty implicated under the pretence of giving a banquet, Vvhuthe party had asembled at table she admitted the wate=> of the Nile by a secret cat-?.], and thus drowned the Thole of her guests, l euriog that this monstrous act of vengance might draw down upon her head the wrath of tie pople, she flung herself :iito an apartment filled with a&hef(ou/pia urocov 7rAiop), Her object in to doing ia variasi ? ccnstroed. According to the usual interpreta-tion,ahe committed suicide ; but Larcher, ia a note, states his oinicn that she merely plungfd herself into ashes, as an at of humiliation, to excite the commiseration of her su’ jets.
TL name of Nibocris is intimately connected with the thir¿¡pyramid. According to the authority of the Egyptian hisfoian Manetbo, cited l»y Julius Africanus and Euaeius, this pyramid was the work of the Amazm.-?1 Quee, and this belief is favoured by the Chevalier Bunsen, whos of opinion that although the edifice was commenced by Ikjrcerinus it- was completed by Nifcoeris. The theory, menloned and rejected by Herodotus (ii. 131), that the third pyramid was the work of a courtesan named Rhoq-is, is less disdainfully treated by moderns, for it is regajed ai extremely probable that Rhcdopis and Nitocris are te earns person, or rather that the former name, which eignies “ rosy-cheeked,” was given to the Queen on account cf be beautiful complex!on. A a additional interest belongs toR -.cris, through tbe fact that Herodotus in his G:io (InS-mentions another Niwcris, preen of Assyria, whn reigud . ve generations after Semirami1?, ai d distinguished her;i ly the magnitude cf her public works. The sirni-Urit;between the Assyrian »nd the Egyptian Queens seems too feat to have been the result of mere aecideut, and pcini to some early connexion between the traditions of tbe tro countries.
Ast vehicle for bringing upon the Drary-lane sfage a grre.t grantiiy cf scenes and properties illustrative of Anoint Egypt, the short narrative contained in tha Sulcpe, has been adopted by Mr. FitabaU, and has cot-only leen expanded, but considerably altered even in principle
-Vfacria (Miss Glyn;, sister to Jleephra (Mr. Edgarl, King of Eypt, has been brought up in seclusion among the Prie.Te"ses of Ida, vhoae ternp’e, with the pyramids in the bactround, is shown in the first tableau. While thus In retir®ent she forms an attachment to Tihrak (Mr. barry Su’llun) a young Ethi. dan, whose father Las been slain by iespliro, and who now „talks about with Ilia younger trot} r K<:ephed (Mies Andertoo), vowing vengeance for the deed. Soon, however, the quiet existence of Mtocris comes to a -ere ; Ler brother’s Prime Minister Amenophis (Mr. Sfcuaij comes to take her to the Royal Court, and she de-paitin a Roj;J galley, Intended to be one cf tbe “ effects” of th piece.
Ill
The Eecoud tableau bring:: us to the interior cf the palace at Memphis, where we find the Princess indulging in stolen * .■ = j interviews with her swarthy lover. AVhen the King appears,
1 Tihrak finds it convenient to retire; but on the threat of Mesphra to slay his sister on her refusal to many a certain Xing ci Libya, he steps in to the rescue, and recognizes In the Egyptian monarch tli6 slayer of his father. A fresh altercation ensues, in which Nitocris saves the life of her brother from the vengeance of Tihrak; but this only reserves him for the dagger of Koephed, who >eiy opportunely makcE Lis appearance. Guards come on to apprehend the aEsassin, but are forced to content themselves with paying-homage to their new Queen,
On the accession of Nitocris to the throne, her first act is
to proclaim Tihrak her chosen husband, much to the disgust of Amenopbi'1 and the thoroughly Egyptian par ty, t, ho do not admire an Ethiopian alliance. Like many other diB?ppohited politicians, they ccnspiie, and the result of their consp racy is a plan to murder Tibrak at ^ grand banquet, given by the Queen to her Mb ieters. The feast takes place in the (.lgantic Grotto of Memnen, which, with its series of grotesque statues, lining the table?, is one of the most icmarkable -;tnes in .fie play; and in the courpe of the entertainment a dar-ce is executed by Miss Retina vVrlght and the corps de bailed in which mest of the movements are imitated from the postures of figures found in the Egyptian monuments. It ;s now time for Tihrak to put into practice a scheme which he has formed for the destruction of the conspirators, with whose projects fie li3s been made cciuainted. Di-missing the Queen, Le remains alone in tbe midst of hi? enemies, and for some time repliei to their menaces of death by words of £ application. At last, w hen :t.yers will not avail, he touches a spring, whieht causing hi* throne to open, allows him to vanish through the wall, ana then, reappearing on the roof of the apartment, turn? the huge hey of the Nile and admits the waters. The conspirators are destroyed by this contrivance, in which Tifir.-.k dee? the woik &Efci;,ned by Herodotus to Nitocris, and from a completely opposite motive.
So fm, go good; but at this point tbe story begins to grow a ii- He obscure-, owing to a collision between the original plan of the author and certain notions of stage jexigenci- 3 entertained by tbe dynast* of Drury-hne. A world of tragic incident was to have followed^ the exploit of j Tihrak, and was actually gone through on Friday last, when ! a private performance of the play took place in the presence of a select audience. Bat by the arrangement of the ecerea in which these incidents occurred, they all succeeded a grand procession which was lightly regarded as the grar 1 feature of the piece, comprising, as it did, a long serie: of cJ ?Er,ri Egyptian god**, accurately modelled after the antique, and they, therefore, came in as a sort of anticlimax. For the purpose of amending this defect and rendering tho giand procession the conclusion to the play, a series of omissions and transpositions were made, which, although they effected the object immediately contemplated, involved the catastrophe in a fog of obscurity, and gave th"' drama the appearance of—corning to nothing. The audience—who, though they Lad apnlaudtd Miss G-lyn for her truly Ludahla exertions in c. very unworthy part, and had likewise been gratified by the Egyptian dance and the incident borrowed horn Herodotus, had by no means shown any great afitc-uon for the piece a? an entirety— were moved into loud dies&Htfaction by tie sudden termination of the evening^entertainment at 10 o’clock (for the-ie was no afterpiece), and the sibillaticn was as vehement as it wa3 general. Even Mr, Smith, who came forward to explain the altera nor;s that L&d been made since Friday, opened his speech by the observation that this was the season of Mach&elm&s, which, tv ail v l.o understand the arr.-ot cf theatres, was as much as an admission that the disapprobation was not to be mistaken.
That Sitocris, in spite of the immenEe outlay that must have taken placs zo put it upon tfio stage, is an utter failure, would he absurd to doubt, but the manager of Drury Lane need rot \et despair. By the engagement of Mies Giyn, Mr. Barry SuMvan, Mr. C. Mathew?, and the greD. v ¡ me ofihoi id Lyceum company, he has brought together a body cf histrionic artists such aa has not been seen for yea :■* within ifie walls Drury Lane, aG-1 his next» thought bhould be how to eu nicy them in an efficient mar* ner.

DRURY-LANE THEATRE,

b:
5ued»wnof Dnuy-lane, which «ras rendered so clonily by the dismal spectacle with which the season commenced* grew bright yesterday evening through the genial induenee '.f. Mr Charles Mattswe, whose cheerful countenance, was discovered on the rising of the curtain, ana no soonei! beheld than recognized with enthusiastic plaudits from every part of a crowded house. The piece selected for his appearance was tho Wealthy Widow, the version made by Mr. Poole of the French piece already fami* liarized to the public by the Spring and Autumn of the late Mr. Kenney When both pieces were new a dia® cnssion arose as t o which translator had gone drat to his work* but the debate and explanation have loBt th6ir interest, now the subject matter is nearly 30 years old, for it was in October, 1827, that the lamps of Drury “lane first Bhon.9 upon the Wealthy Widov:, now entitled Mar-ied fov Money,
The story of the piece will doubtless be remembered. Ita moral is directed against marriageB between persons of very unequal age, and the person to whom the task of conveying i ethical instruction is confided is a youog rake of fire*and- I twenty, who, having married a widow of fifty for the sake of her money, finds biinEelf a domestic Bl&ve, despised by evea
his own servants, till, during the period of a short arrest. ^

be contrives to get drunk in a sponging-house, and, returning home, asserts his marital supremacy on the strength of tho a liquor. At the pre.-ent day this tale, evsn with the additional interest of an old gentleman who first intends to espouse the elderly lady’s daughter, but is scared from hia purpose by f * the bickerings of the married couple, seems but a nieagra t-% foundation for three acts ; but there was such a charm in the manner in which Mr. Charles Mathews rattled the chain of domestic captivity, rendered fearfally tight by the & stern resolution of Mrs. Frank’Matthews, that it wrb irnpos-eibla for a piece to go off more pleasantly. Mr. Youuge, tco, was a good hearty old soul as the venerable suitor; Miss M. Oliver was a remarkably spirited young . $ lady, fully determined to have and to manifest a will ;. of her own ; Mr. Koxby made the best he could of tha favoured admirer, who, as such gentlemen usually are, id , written as the least interesting person in the piece ; and Miss Mason puts forth a proper measure of perfcnees aa one of those soiibretk, who once held a leading position in every ccmedy, but are now becoming more and more rare upco. the British stage. In a word, the whole thing waa capitally acted, and Mr. Poole's dialog re, which, it should be observed, is exceedingly smart, sparkled merrily ou the ears of the audience. A few lines introduced at the be* ginDirg referred to Mr. Charles Mathew’s change from manager of the Lyceum to actor at Drury-lane, and these, of course, elicited an especial roar,
Nitoeris is now played at second price, which D to a certain extent an improvement, for, if it could have succeeded at all. it would have been as a splendid after-piece. Everything in the way of decoration baa been done by the manager, and the procession, in which the Egyptian goda are carried along in a series almost interminable, is of it* kind unique; but nothing can compensate for the intriiv sic duinesfl and obscurity of the drama, A portUa that was omitted on Monday is now restored, probably the ftrfct instance of 44 cut and come again.'* ever known in the case of a new p'ay. But the restor&Moa an-» swan no purpose save that of justifying the excilkn which caused part of the indignation displayed on. the opening night.
As we have said before, the manager coed not dcapiir wrUs his present company. He has only to contrast the hearty enjoyment produced by Married for Money vith tk« lethargy caused by Nitocria to receive the GQBSoUtioa 'if a favourable omen,.

DRURF LANE THEATRE AND NCTOCRIB,
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,- When a piece has been reviewed by a daily journal twice in three days—an unus is.1couree— 1 cannot omit sending you a few lines on the subject
In the first place your critic describes Nifocris, the piece alluded, to, as dismal« Whether the dialogue of the piece h dismal or not has nothing to do with the remarks of that gentlemen with reference to “ the eft acts of the piece,” for it has been pronounced by upwards of 3,000 persons to bo the most brilliant pj ecUcle produced for years. The calls before the curtain nightly of the artiste by an audience for whom I have endeavoured to cater for the last three years in sc large an establishment as this, having at least 1,000 persons depending on me for support and in which I have hitherto discharged strictly every obligation, led me to expecr and hop-e (especially from your journal, which haa hitherto afforded me Buch gratifying encouragement) a little more praise for the efforts I have made* particularly when every other daily journal in London has stimulated me by their articles to produce a piece of the above description.
In placing Nitocris on the stage at a cost of nearly 3,C002., admitting the dialogue not to be good, in illustrating the manners and customs of the ancient Egyptians, taken with the greatest sc curacy from the British Museum and works of different authors, I consider T have advanced a step of rational ami sement aud instruction to all classes of society, and, however “ dismal” the spectacle may be, money has been refused at the doors of every part of the house since the piece has been produced. iVs to the indignation displayed on the opening night, it was not against the piece itself; but, as it was thought it would occupy toe much time, it was curtailed by one act, which baa since been re stored, and thence the confusion on the first night’s representation.
It is rot in a spirit of finding fault with your criticism of the production, which is tire life and bouI of upright journalism, but only inking to h*\e justice done to “ my efforts,” at acy rate, if nraise could not be conscientiously accorded to the author of the piece. To show that I am not insensible to the opinion of your critic It is my determination to take his advice and reduce the spectacle to three acts land the grand tableaux), aa ha stated it went well up to that time, fhe object of my present address is to inform you of this, and respectfully request, f-s you have given me a “second condemnatory notice,” you will be kind enough to give your opinion “ a third time” after Monday night.
I am, Sir, your obliged servant,
October 11.	E. T. SMITH.
*J We have already distinguished the decorations of Niiocrh from the piece Itself. Nay, in that “second condemnatory notice,” as Mr. Smith calls it, though it was mainly occupied by the account of Mr. Charles Mathews’s brilliant reception, we expressly stated that “everything in the way of decoration has bean done by the manager, and the piocession, in which the Egyptian gods are carried along in a series almost interminable, is, of its kind, unique.” To the suffrages of the 8,COO persons who declare the spectacle to be brilliant, and of there daily journals which, it seems, not only admire tbs piece, but have stimulated its production, we are quite willing to add our own, as far as the manager is concerned, though we must repeat the assertion that his liberality has been ill-bestowed on so indifferent a play. That the piece is not considered satisfactory even by the ma.iagunent itself may be inferred from the fact that it was cut short on Monday last, when it formed the sole piece of the evening, was ;
played in an elongated form on Wednesday, when it came *-i Ur a three-act comedy, and is to be cut down again on Monday next. By way of conclusion, we may aa well anticipate Monday by a third statement of opinion, in complianoa with Mr. Smith’s desire. We therefore say that we thoroughly approve of the omission of the obscure and unmeaning fourth act, and that, whereas the scenery and properties are magnificent, while the drama is worthless, any curtailment that will reduce the lat*er to a mere thread connecting the former together will be a Djaoifedt improvement.

The field chosen by Mr. Fitzball is free from doubt: the explorations in the tombs and temples of Egypt have made us intimately acquainted, not merely with the regal and priestly pornp, hut with the domestic Epaqpera, oqstcima, and habits of the ancient Egyptians. With so many authentic pictures to gui.le and direct, wa are not surprised t,o find that in this spectacle we are presented with a aerie» of pictures which are well calculated to afford an accurate couception of that country, the vicissitude» of which are so deeply associated with the interesting incidents of sacred and profaar history.
Enormous afftches and innumerable advertisement» in the papers have for month» informed us of the intended production of an Egyptian spectacle, by M; Fitzbail. called “ Nitocris,” in which much expense was to be incurred and much learned research en-
gaged to revive in exact imitation, the gigantit monuments of Egyptian splendour, and the curious symbols of Egyptian superstition. The promises, as largely indulged in on paper, have been fnltlled on the stage of Drury Lane Theatre, by Mr, bmith, who inaugurated his season with a spectacle novel as interesting, and as correct in every detail as care, erudition, and an unlimited outlay cau make it. The scenery is admirable; the coronation scene is extraordinarily effective, occupying a» it does the whole depth of the stage, which is completely covered with oilcloth.
THEATRICAL OBSERVER., Oct. 9th, l BELL’3 LIFE m LONDON, 14tk.
Mr. E T. Smith, in organising hia forces for a winter campaign at Drury Lane, has formed a coalition, comprising several of the specialities of the modern London stage. From the Lyceum he lias taken, not only light comedy, but some of its choicest representatives, in the persons of Mr. Charles t-iiews, Mr. Roxby, Miss Oliver, and Mrs. >rank Matthews. His scenic and classical illustrations, as well as his playbills, are upon the Princess’s model. The high tragedy clement is represented by Miss Glynn. Cov .nt Garden is emulated in respect of stage effects. The ballet has its upholder in the best af Englich dancers, Miss Rosina Wright; while the strongly spiced Surrey an drama is—with due regard the gods and to low prices—personified by Mr.
1 itzbail. The opening play was the “ Egyptian drama,’' of which we have so long heard mysterious announcements. As regards the scenery, we can »illy say that it appears quite a» accurate and beauti-iu as any Egyptian illustrations that we have seen. The properties, idols, &c., are really very splendidly | got up ; the ballet is pretty and characteristic ; and j two of the scenes, were admirable pieces of stage »fleet.
Mr. E. Y. Smith commenced hia winter campaign list night, with the arxiously-iooked-for Egyptian drama, " Nitocris,” upon the perfect production of which the worthy Lessee has expended somewhere between two and three thousand pounds. It certainly is a magnificent specimen of stage arrangement, and will, we trust, repay Mr. Smith for his earnest endeavour to give the public a perfect illustration of Egyptian manners and customs,
TEE RACING TIMES, Oct, 9th.
We have given a Ihasty sketch of the drama as written, and will now endeavour to describe the manner in which it has been put upon the stage. In one word then, we may say that it is the most magnificent spectacle that we have ever seen upon the stage; and Mr. Smith i* perfectly justified in saying that “no pains have been spired—no expense has been considered too great—no research too trying, in order to present a strictly accurate picture of the history, habits, manners, and customs of the Pharaonic period,”
On Monday Mr. E. T. Smith commenced his winter season by producing bis wonderful Egyptian play of“ Nitocris,” which has been month» in preparation. The scenery was well painted, particularly the interiors, luri that in which the conspirators were drowned was remarkably successful, and was the most perfect attempt at introducing water upon the stage which was ever produced, ar.d the groups of dead, seen through he transparent mediums which rose up through the stage with the new electric light upon them, wa« admirably effec five ; nor do we think that the coronation scene was ever surpassed in the grand display it made of gorgeoiu and massive objects, when they were all arranged before the final appearance of the king and queen and the fallof the curtain. The music was characteristic. The whole play has been most expensively and cleverly got up, in token of which Mr. E. T. Smith was called on to receive the congratulations of the audience.

Mr. Smith commenced his winter season on Monday last, having engaged a company of such strength as is not only calculated to elevate the character of ’die theatre, but likewise remunerate the lessee for his 'nterprise, The season was inaugurated by the long talked of Egyptian play called “ Nitocris,” As a wa nronounce “ Nitocris” to bee theatrical
interest, The Egyptians of the time of Pharoah lived again ; and, 63 far as ¡e.irning and deep research availed, they were surrounded by wonted objects and wonted scenery. In an original Egyptian play entitled “ Nitocris,” Mr. Fitzball showed the London public of 1855 how queen» reigned four thousand years ago. So great was the excitement on the opening night that even standing room was hardly procurable, and Nitocris in the person of the celebrated Miss Glynlp secured the plaudits of one of the largest audiences ever asswnbled within tbe walls of
“ Nitocris, Queen of Egypt,” the grand pageant so universally announced, ar.-d so long expected, was produced at this theatre on Monday last, with an amount of splendour and arcbaelogical labour which finds uo parallel in the history of upectarie. The lessee deserves the ttianks and aid of the public for his enterprising spirit.

Worshipped by the inhabitants of Thobais (Plutarch).
The Aep was.‘■acred to this God.
The Ark, bearing his hieroglyph, with that of the Beetle, or “Creative Power,” is also decorated with this emblem.
Symbolic Standard of “ Athoi” (Venus), the oracle of Night or Darkness (? chaos), “ irom whence arose all created things” (Egyptian belief). Symbolic standard of ditto.

represented with her eyes closed, or blinded.
The priesL: bearing this Goddess have libation buckets and simpula.
“ Thraei," or Troth, or Justice. This deity has also a two-fold character as the Goddess of Truth and J ustice. The small image of this god was worn by the Chief Judge while engaged in listening to cases brought before him.
A similar emblem was worn by the High Priests af the Jews, and it is remarkable that the word “ Tbummim" is not only translated “ Truth,” but being a plural or dual word, corresponds to the Egyptian word of “ Two Truths”—». e. “ Light and Truth"—breastplates having the figures of the two Gods, “ Re” (Eight) and “ Thmci” (Truth) represented upon them have been discovered.
Priests with Scarabffii.
The Scarabeus may be considered as an emblem of“ The Sun”—of “ The Creative power”—and of the God “ Pthah” (Vulcan).
Incense Bearer,
Waving his incense patera before the God. The incense was in the shape of a small globe or pill; and, upon modern analysis, is found to consist of aromatic substances with gum, and gave out coloured light or flame when thrown into the burning cup.
No. 3.—“APIS.” His titles were “The Sacred Bill of Memphis,”“The Bull of Abundance,” “Adored by the People," “The Sacred Bull of Pthah,” “Guardian of the Solar Year,” “Apis renowned over the oV.or d,” “ The Symbol of Inundation."

Measurement” or “ Nilometer” of wood divided into cubits.
Attendant Priests also fan the idol and offer homage as it passes forward.	.
Thu festivals in honour of Apis lasted seven days, on which occasion a large concourse of people assembled at Memphis—the Priests led i he Far red (Jiving) Bull in solemn procession, every one coming forward Irom their houses to welcome him.
Pliny and 8 fiinus affirm that children who smelt his breath were thought thereby gifted with tin- no ‘er of predicting future events.
The tokens wide » distinguished this Sacred Bull .it its birth were a white sp.d icsembling a cr-M enton its right side, and a lump under its it iu the form oi a beetle—as pre« ended by the priests. The people \, i.eved him to be the eause of the swelling and inundation o fie Nile, .vhUik produced fertility and abundance, and celebrated his festival at about the period of this annual occurrence, with every demonstration of rdoieiuti ¿md literal abandonment to the intoxication ofyy all over the kingdom,
Many tempi#* were erected and dedicated to “ Apis,” and one also to “Scrapis,” the Divinity of the Column of .Measurement—the Nilometer !

Priests with the pretended God “Canopu-.,” or Water Offering to the God of the Nile.
It is said that the Chaldeans, tran«p »rtiug the lire, which was their d >rj, into all the province*', offered to let him combat with thuse of other nations, on eoudi’ion that If he remained tin- conqueror, tiny .should adore lfim. The pYi.vAs of Canopus acrepied the ehatl nge and d vi ed this stratagem. They fabricate iii Etrypv pitvhers of an extremely porous
earth, Hi rough which the -vatcr Hltv-ihs and is purified Th.- Arch-priest to <k one oi them, stopped the pores with wax, and painting it, of various colours, filled it with water, and made it his God. Recovered it with the head of an ancient statue, said to be that of the pilot of Mercians. The Chaldeans presented themselves; the contest began ; they lighted their fire around the vase; the wax melts, the water runs through the pores, and extinguishes the fire. The fraud of the Priest gave ¿he victory to Canopus over the Chaldean d iiy. From that moment his ‘image has been represented with very short feet, a narrow neck, and the bellp and back founded like a pitcher. It is under His form that he is worshipped as the vanquisher of all the Gods.”—Rulfia llistoiru de TEnghse livre sec <nd.
No.4.—THE GODDESS “ PASH-iY* “ The Memphian Lioness," “The beloved of Plhab,” “The Goddess of Fire," “Bubastes” (the Diana of the Greeks) preovded by sacred dancers. 'The Idol carried by Priests iu th< ir leopard-skin dr, sses. -vith red incense flaming before her, and surrounded by “Symbolic Divinities,”“ Winged Geniuses,” &c.

shrieked as 10,1(1 «s possible, struck the “ Crotola” (cymbals), or clappers of wood .and metal, Ac.
Lotus Dancers (Females),
Incense Bearers. *
No. 5. THE GOD “ OSIRIS,” ns “Osiris Pethempamenfces” (the Pluto of the Greeks). “ He who is Re sident in the Hades,” “ President of the Atnenti,” “ Receiver and Giver,” “ fheSuji,” “ The Eye of the World,” “ The Source of t.ljfl Nile,” “ He who has many Eyes,” a form of Ammon, wearing the “Ati,” and having the Crook and Flagellum. Regarded as the author of time, from the words “ Osch-lri,” “ the maker of time.”
The principal office of this Deity was to Judge the Dead, and to rule over that kingdom where the souls of good men were admitted to eternal felicity.
This Deily was very famous—his Temples and Priests wore to be found in almost every part of Egy pt; the sac re 1 rites of Osiris were a profound mystery, never revealed, llis name even avoided, as of too august a nature vo be mentioned.
The “Ivy,” with which the Priests decorated themselves, was sacrc-d to Rim, and also the “ Mc-liolotus.”
Xo. 6. THE SACKED BOAT OF THE AMENTI, or Lower Be?ions. with the four Genii, or Demi-Gods (bearing emblems of Life and
Power) and their vases of “ Amcnti.” or that subterraneous region where they (the Egyptians) imagined the souls of the dead to go alter their decease.
The 1st genius is “ Amset,” “Judge of the Amenti.” (Human headed.) The 2d is “ Hepi,” “ Concealed Number.” (Baboon beaded.)
The 3d ;.s “ Tuautmutf," “ Adorer of his Mother.” (Jackal headed.) "The 4th is “Kabh-senuf,” “Refresher oi his Brethren,” (Hawk beaded).
The Sepulchral Vases have heads in shape of the Four Genii of the Dead, and each was employed for holding a portim of the Viscera of the deceased, embalmed separately a.ul deposited in them. On the “Amset” Vase is inscribed the spec h of “Isio" to the dead ; on that of “Hepi” is a similar speech from “Nepthys; on that of “Tuautmutf,” one from • Keith:” aad on that of “ Kabh-svuuf,” one from " Sclk/* The purport
of each being an Assurance of Protection, and of being “near thee,” “ beside thee,” or “ 1 come to be beside thee.”
The Sacred Boat is followed by the symbolic “Eyes of Osiris,” or, of “ The Sun.” emblems of the all-seeing presence of the Divinity.
Note.—Besides the Four Amenti, there were Forty-two Assessors or Judges of the Forty-two Crimes, from which a good man should be free; and these also differ from the Thirty-six Demons mentioned by Origeu, that presided over the human body, and were invoked to cure the infirmities of the peculiar member immediately under their protection.
No. 7. THE GODDESS “ISIS,” or “THE SEAT.” The Hieroglyphic Throne on her bead, and followed by the Priestess and Virgins dedicated to her worship. Isis was styled also “ The Beginning" (as her sister, “Nepthys,” was “ The End"), and “ Isis, Queen of Egypt/* “ The Goddess of the Moon,” “Defender of her Brother,” &Q. (The “ Ceres" of the Greeks.)
“The festival,” says Herodotus, “which they celebrate at Busoris in honour of Lis ¡3 magnificent. After prayers, a Bull is sacrificed, which the Priests cut up and afterwards burn, pouring oil on the lire while the victim is consuming. Kneeling and striking themselves iu honour of
* Osiris,' they afterwards eat what remains of the sacrifice.”

He is attended by his sacred emblems and standards. The Hawk was dedicated to him, the Tamara.sk Tree, the Tcstudo (Lyre), Ac., Ac.
One of the principal duties ot “ Horus,” was that of introducing the souls of the da l into the presence of“ Osiris,’’ after they had passed the ordeal of liu.il judgment; lie also assisted “Amset” in weighing and a.-cei Laming their good conduct during life, previous to their admission into the august presence oi his Father iu the blessed regions of the Arnenti.
Incense Bearers.
No.fi. THE GODDESS “NEPTHYS” (“Proserpine” of the Greeks), called also “ flic End,” *' The Sister Goddess,” “ l'he Saviour Sister Goddess,” “The Barren,” “Reetrixof the Lower Regions.” On her head the hieroglyphic emblem of her name, a oowl and basket,” called “ Neb,” placed upon a house, answering to “ Ei " or “Tei,” “ Neb-tei” or “ N'eb-thy,” “ The Lady of the Abode."
“ The Sislrum, having the face of Isis on one side, and Nepthys on the other, hieroglyphic-ally represents ‘the beginning and the end, or generation and corruption.’ ”—(Plutarch).	.
No. 10. THE GODDESS “NE1TH” (tlie “Minerva” of the Greeks), enthroned with sceptre, and wearing the “Teshr," preceded by Musicians, Male and Female, Bearers oi Incense with green flame, and surrounded by symbolic divinities.

Musical instruments string d (the Buoni, or harp of seventeen strings, especially) were dedicated to her. “ Keith,” or “ Nelli,” is the supposed origin of the Greek name, “ Thetra ” or “ Athena.”
The belief of the Egyptians in “the Existence of a Supreme Being,” is proved by the inscription over the Temple of Minerva (Neith), in hieroglyphic characters—viz., “I am that which is, which was, and shall be. No Mortal has lifted up my veil—the offspring of my power is the Sun.” And the “ Immortality of the Soul,’’ by the prayer recited at the time of death, by an Egyptian, expressing his desire to be received into the presence of the Deities.

THE MORNING POST, Oct. 9th.
I’lie success which lias lately attended tlie production of pieces as vehicles for extraordinary scenic effects, gorgeous processions, and extensively splendid dresses, as well as costly stage appointments, has induced tbo Iop.'oc >>f tills tllCHtri, Mb. Ei I: §nilill; to endeavour, by an equally liberal outlay, to follow in the course which has proved hitherto so remunerative. It must be admitted that the profusion displayed on “ Nitocris,” which was produced for the first, time last evening, has never been exceeded. In judging of theatrical pieces, it is always necessary to remember the purpose for which they are brought forward, and as that purpose was last night to astonish, by grand scenery and stage contrivances, if the dialogue was sufficient to carry on the story, and sustain the actions during the intervals, it is all that could be reasonably required. But in saying this, we are by no means prepared to admit, as it seems the fashion to assert, that the play-going public want nothing more than show : and it is assuming too much to say that really legitimate writing will not meet with due encouragement until the trial lias been made. No one cun tell what the conduct of the public will he until they have had an opportunity ol deciding. This has certainly nof been the case for some time

MORNING ADVERTISER, Oct- 9th-
Nitocris, Queen of Egypt, is a sufficiently doubtful personng*. fr. gtvo vvory latltxido to n. dramatint
who desires to weave into his play “startling incidents. emanating from national and ministerial
past; for the pieces winch have been produced, if jealousies, love, ambition, and implacable revenue they were formed of good materials, were so clumsily j'We dont know that a Shakspeare or a Sophocles joined as to present no well-connected appearance, J COuld render the human events of a gorgeous snccta ami others, in which there were signs of a skilful interesting; suffice it, that in the few interstices or workman in that respect, depended for their only j pauses, in a succession of scenes, which from their substance upon frog-sized ideas, so blown out to 1 gorgaetisncss or grandeur, entirely absorb the atten bovine proportions as to be totally unbearable.

The long announced more the fault of writers for the stage than those who j spectacle last night overflowed its gorgeousness its patronise the theatre.	i learning, and its wonders on the stage of Drury Lane
In the banquet scene a ballet was introduced, and more than realised all that had been expected of which was very chararactenstic, and seemed to nave -.	,	..	.. i
been composed upon tht^ Egyptian forms which we are in the habit of seeing in the museums. The attitudes were very well kept, and the corps dc ballet deserve great praise for the spirited manner in which they danced, and the evident determination they displayed to sustain the peculiarity of their evolutions. Miss Rosina Wright was very successful as the principal dancer, and obtained considerable applause.
The scenery was well painted, particularly the interiors ; but that in which the conspirators were drowned was remarkably' successful, and was the most perfect attempt at introducing water upon the stage which was ever produced ; and the groups of dead, seen through the transparent mediums which rose up through the stage with the electric light upon them, was admirably effective ; nor do we think that the coronation scene was ever surpassed in the grand display it made of gorgeous and massive objects, when they were all arranged before the final appearance of the king and queen and the fall of the curtain. The writing was suited to the style of the piece. The music was characteristic. The whole play lias been most expsnsively and cleverly got up, in token of which Mr. E. T. Smith was called on to receive the congratulations of the audience. The house was completely tilled in every part.
it. We conscientiously proclaim for “ Nitocri.s ” Queen of Egypt, a success monstrous and proportion-
ate to its own vast resources.
THE ERA, Oct. 9th.
The strength of the piece lies in the spectacular portion of it, and there is a sufficiency of excellence about it to repay by its attraction the vast outlay by which surpassing brilliancy lias been achieved.’ A pretty characteristic ballet, in wliicl
the equally significant figures within. The vicissitudes of vocation to which “her Majesty’s servants ” are exposed arc ns multifarious in complexion as they are remote from the old notions of legitimacy ; but each successive effort, whether it be an English or a German opera, a masked ball, or a troop of horse-riders, has won its comparative degree of profit , and a sixpenny gallery and a shilling pit have paid tlie way. Now, however, the cards played are of a different colour. An attempt is contemplated which we sliail be glad to see successful; foi though the lessee cannot omit resorting to his old methods in courting the popular patronage, to which something of the spirit of Barnumism is but too visible, the aim irgcons spectacle *tst**t' ’8 f?°°d and honorable, and may possibly tend to ;ntr.vi(; ... i revive the interest in our national drama.
Strong opportunity for display is afforded by i libretto of this description, and much has been done by the manager to produce a glowing series of tableaux illustrative of Egypt and Egyptian life. The locality is far from new as regards pictorial delineation ; for the massive temples of Pliaroah have long been used up by the scene-painters. The learned “ Dykvynkin,” to whom Mr. Smith has assigned flic task of superintendence, and whose research in ascertaining the precise characteristics of Egyptian architecture and worship he announces with grandiloquent emphasis, has laboured diligently : and the accessories of the piece arc not only multitudinous, but as accurate, doubtless, as such things need to be.

Mr. Smith commenced his winter season on Monday last, having engaged a company of such strength as is not only calculated to elevate the character of the theatre, but likewise remunerate the lessee for his enterprise.

After a long preparation, the new Egyptian drama, the result of Mr. Smith's “researches in Herodotus, Denons, Wilkinson, and the libraries and jnuseums of London and Paris,” was brought out on Monday night. Taken as a spectacle, “ Nitocris” answers its end. The banquet room in the Grotto of Munition has, to us, by far the richest effect.

Bis dawn ol Drury Lane, which was rendered so cloudy by the dismal spectacle with which tiro season commenced, grew bright yesterday evenintr through t ic genial influence ot Mr. Charles Mathews, whose e leetful countenance was discovered on the rising of t ic curtain, and no sooner beheld than recognized with • enthusiastic plaudits from every part of a crowded house.
i he story of the piece, “ Married for Moneywill doubtless be remembered, its moral is directed against marriages between persons of very unequal age, and the person to whom the task of conveying ethical instruction is confided is a young rake of its e-nnd-twenty,who, having married a widow’of fifty for thc sa|<(! (f he«1 money, finds himself a domestic '■ a\ e, despised by even his own servants, till, during Gro period of a short arrest, he contrives to get drunk
a KPpnfilinfi-honse, and, returning home, a-sorts his marital supremacy on the strength of the liquor.
. '■ *10 pi'^cnt day this tale, evim 1 with th«' additional interest, of an old gentleman, who first intends to espouse the elderly lady s daughter,but is scared firm ■ its purpose by the bickerings of the married eouple, seems but a meagre foundation for three acts; but ¡here was Kuril a charm in the manner in which - f’. j barbs Mathews rattled rhe chain of domestic captivity, rendered fear tally tight by the stern resolution of Mrs. | ram, Matthews, that it n as impossible tor a piece to go iff more pleasantly.

Mr Mathews was called at the close, of the first act; .he whole of the principal characters, at the end of the second ; and at the close, were again sainted with cordial and unanimous approbation—a result due not only to the spirit and finish of the actors, but to the brilliancy and point of the dialogue “ Married for Money ” is a decided hit.

WEEKLY DISPATCH.
On Wednesday Mr. Smith brought forward the comic part of his company. The house, as on Monday, was crowded in every part. Tin* novelty was an altered version of the “ Wealthy Widow”— a comedy some twenty years old, which has been compressed and almost re-written tor the present occasion Mr. Mathews received a hearty welcome,] the applause was continued for several minutes, and only ceas'-d to be followed by loud laughter when 1m ] commenced the piece by pointed allusions to his own situation. He had got into a handsome house, and had no longer to pay the bills, and he wondered if he shoutd be as much liked as formerly—remarks which were cleverly contrived to serve a double purpose. Mr Mathews appeared before the curtain after each act,and at the conclusion ‘he applause was very warmly bestowed.
sure that the manner in which he was taken, so to speak, to the hearts iff bis old friends and admirers, last evening, must have been one of the most agreeable incidents of his life. Notwithstanding his irregular ovation on Monday evening, the freshness ot his presence did not seem a hit diminished, and he was received with an enthusiasm equal to his deserts. For, after all, there is no denying that in his line he has at present no equal on the English stage; and that that line, though perhaps not lying amongst the snowy p>-aks of the very highest ridges of art, does carry us through those humbler, but less frigid districts, where, we all find ourselves more at home and much better amused. Therefore, are we heartily glad to see Charles Mathews amongst us again. Charles Mathews’s Mopus is amongst his best parts ; nothing can Iro more amusing, and at the same time more true, than his picture of the MI11SII1 nn„	,

It may be mentioned 'to advantage that the one scene, that suffices for the action of the three acts is one of there perfect representations of a drawing-room that would at once indicate the taste so constantly shown in the s’ave arrangements of the Lyceum as being already actively manifested in the same department ai this theatre. Each evening during the week the comedy has been repeated, and crowded audim- and hearty approvers have attested the judgment- of the lessee and the unmingled satisfaction that the performances have given.	1
On "Wednesday, Charles Mathews met with a niost uproarious welcome in a new adaptation of Poole’s “ Wealthy Widow, re-christened “ Married for Money.” Never did Mathews play with finer humor , never did audience more abundantly' sympathise with their favorite. Mr. Mopus is, of course, henpecked, and endures his fate with most comic resignation. His allusions to debt and difficulties were keenly relished both by himself and audience. Indeed, Mathews makes only a huge joke of the Queen’s Bench, and dives and gambols in the ocean of debt like a dolphin in the summer sea. To him a writ on’y conveys a jest, and a sheriffs officer is the younger brother of Motnus. Altogether the piece v\enr off with abounding good humor.
amusing hints at “ bills,” “ tradesmen,” and “embarrassments,” were eagerly caught at by the audience, who showed their pleasure at again meeting an old favorite by hearty and continued applause.

Some lines in the opening contained allusions to his change from the position of mauager of the Lyceum to act oi- at Drury Lane, and tiiev were caught opbv the audience with great gusto and friendly feeling.

As a scenic spectacle the piece is entitled to the highest praise. It is not only rich, splendid, and beautiful, but must be regarded as a faithful and vivid delineation oi “ the land of Egypt” as it existed in the old days of the Pharoalis. The buildings, the decorations oi the temples anil the palaces, the grim uncouth idols, tile arms of the soldiers, the attire of the various classes of men and women—every object, in short, animate and inanimate, is placed before our eyes with a truth and reality which must have been the result of unwearied research and consummate graphic skill.

MORNING ADVERTISER, Oct- 9th-
Nitocris, Queen of Egypt, is a sufficiently doubtful personage to give every latitude to a dramatist who desires to weave into his play “ startling incidents, emanating from national and ministerial jealousies, love, ambition, and implacable revenge.” We dont know that a Shakspeare or a Sophocles could render the human events of a gorgeous spectacle interesting; suffice it, that in the few interstices or pauses, in a succession of scenes, which from their

THE GLOBE, Oct- 9th.
Mr, E. T. Smith, in organising
his forces for a
winter campaign at Drury Lane, has formed a coalition, comprising several of the specialities of the modern London stage. From the Lyceum he has taken, not only light comedy, but some of its choicest representatives, in the persons of Mr. Charles Mathews, Mr. Roxby, Miss Oliver, and Mrs. Frank Matthews. His scenic and classical illustrations, as well as his playbills, are upon the Princess’s model.
The high tragedy element is represented by Miss Glynn. Covent Garden is emulated in respect of stage effects. The ballet has its upholder in the best of Englich dancers, Miss Rosina Wright; while the strongly spiced Surrey an drama is—with due regard to the gods and to low prices—personified by Mr.
Fitzbail. The opening play was the “ Egyptian
drama,” of which we have so long heard mysterious , Phara-,n;c perj0d.” announcements. As regards the scenery, we can1 only say that it appears quite as accurate and beautiful'as a"ny Egyptian illustrations that we have seen.
The properties, idols, &c., are really very splendidly got up ; the ballet is pretty and characteristic ; and two of the scenes, were admirable pieces of stage effect.
which are so deeply associated with the interesting incidents of sacred and profane history.
THEATRICAL OBSERVER, Oct. 9th.
Mr. E. T. Smith commenced his winter campaign last night, with the anxiously-looked-for Egyptian drama, “Nitocris,” upon the perfect production of which che worthy Lessee has expended somewhere between two and three thousand pounds. It certainly is a magnificent specimen of stage arrangement, and will, we trust, repay Mr. Smith for his earnest endeavour to give the public a perfect illustration of Egyptian manners and customs.
betoken a desire to pursue a more legitimate course, though without conceding the principle of cheap admission, which be lias found to work so satisfactorily. He has now plunged into the higher responsibilities of management, and proposes, while leaning for support, upon the temptation of spectacle, to cultivate coincidently with it no less a commodity than polite comedy and the more delieatee pieces of the French school. The company he has engaged for the prosecution of this double scheme is, as times go, of a very respectable character ; and the aggregate expenses af a speculation so obviously large and important wil! test the virtue of economical prices to an extent in which as yet there has been no experience. Mr. Smith certainly deserves the countenance of the many. He has catered sedulously for their amusement, and lie has been fettered by no “ compunctious visitings ” as regards the class of entertainment which he has set before them, notwithstanding the Sliakesperian effigy which still crest the portico of the house outside, and the equally significant figures within. The vicissitudes of vocation to which “her Majesty’s servants ” are exposed are as multifarious in complexion as they are remote from the old notions of legitimacy , hut each successive effort, whether it he an English or a German opera, a masked ball, or a troop of horse-riders, has won its comparative degree of profit ; and a sixpenny gallery and a shilling pit have paid the way. Now, however, the cards played are of a different colour. An attempt is contemplated which we shall be glad to see successful ; lor though the lessee cannot omit resorting to his old methods in courting the' popular patronage, to which something of the spirit of Barnumism is but too visible, the aim itself is good and honorable, anil may possibly tend to revive the interest in our national drama.
Strong opportunity for display' is afforded by a libretto of this description, and much has been done by the manager to produce a glowing series of tableaux illustrative of Egypt and Egyptian life. The locality is far from new as regards pictorial delineation ; for the massive temples of Pharoah have ■ long been used up by the scene-painters. The learned “ Dykwynkin,” to whom Mr. Smith has assigned the task of superintendence, and whose research in ascertaining the precise characteristics of Egyptian architecture and worship ha announces with grandiloquent emphasis, has laboured diligently ; and the accessories of the piece are not only multitudinous, but as accurate, doubtless, as such things need to be.
THE MORNING CHRONICLE, Oct. 9th.
After eighteen months of preparation the grand Egyptian drama was produced last evening at the opening of this theatre for this season, with a pomp and display of scenery rivalling the celebrated production of “ Sardanapalus ” at the Royal Princess's Theatre. Indeed, in one point, but that a very important one, Drury-lane Theatre has rather the advantage of its rival.
THE WEEKLY DISPATH, Oct. 14th
Enormous a filches and innumerable advertisements in the papers have for months informed us of the intended production of an Egyptian spectacle, by Mr. Fitzbail, called “ Nitocris ” in which much expense was to be incurred and much learned research engaged to revive in exact imitation, the gigantic monuments of Egyptian splendour, and the curious symbols of Egyptian superstition. The promises, as largely indulged in on paper, have been fulfiled on the stage of Drury Lane Theatre, by Mr. Smith, who inaugurated his season with a spectacle novel as interesting, and as correct in every detail as care, erudition, and an unlimited outlay can make it. The scenery is admirable ; the coronation scene is extraordinarily effective, occupying as it does the whole depth of the stage, which is completely covered with oilcloth.
THE RACING TIMES, Oct. 9th.
We have given a .hasty sketch of the drama as written, and will now endeavour to manner in which it has been put upon the stage, one word then, we may say that it is the most magnificent spectacle that we have ever seen upon the stage; and Mr. Smith is perfectly justified in saying that “no pains have been spared—no expense has been considered too great—no research too hying, in order to present a strictly accurate picture of the history, habits, manners, and customs of the

On Monday Mr. E. T. Smith commenced his winter season by producing his wonderful Egyptian play of“ Nitocris,’* which has been months in preparation.

REYNOLD S NEWS, Oct. 14th.
Mr. Smith commenced his winter season on Monday last, having engaged a company of such strength as is not only calculated to elevate the character of the theatre, but likewise remunerate the lessee for his enterprise.

To all the lovers of the wonderful the proceedings at Drury Lane, on Monday night, must he rife with interest. The Egyptians of the time of Pharoah lived again ; and, as far as learning and deep research availed, they were surrounded by wonted objects and wonted scenery. In an original Egyptian play entitled “ Nitocris,” Mr. Fitzball showed the London public of 1855 how queens reigned four thousand years ago. So great was the excitement on the opening night that even standing room was hardly procurable, and Nitocris in the person of the celebrated Miss Glynn, secured the plaudits of one of the largest audiences ever assembled within the walls of Drury Lane.
THE WEEKLY TIMES, Oct. 14th.
“ Nitocris, Queen of Egypt,” the grand pageant so universally announced, and so long expected, was produced at this theatre on Monday last, with an amount of splendour and archfelogical labour which finds no parallel in the history of spectacle. The lessee deserves the thanks and aid ot the public for his enterprising spirit.
THE PRESS, Oct. 14th.
After a long preparation, the new Egyptian drama, the result of Mr. Smith's “researches in Herodotus, Denons, Wilkinson, and the libraries and museums of London and Paris,” was brought out on Monday night. Taken as a spectacle, “ Nitocris” answers its and. The banquet room in the Grotto of Memnon has, to us, by far the richest effect.

THE DAILY AEWS.
Mr. Charles Mathews made bis first appearance last night, snd had such a reception as has seldom been witnessed. The house was so crowded that it was difficult to find even standing room in .any part of it. When the curtain rose Mr. Mathews was discovered alone—a perfect storm of applause burst from ail quarter«—peal after peal reiterated for several minutes—and when he began to »peak, almost every word he uttered was caught up as containing
.	,	tc,< , some personal allusion to his own position and oir-
aga.nst marriages between persons of very unequal ,.un,st'anceB> aIld drew forth fresh bursts of popular
age, and the person to whom the ta»k of conveying ethical instruction is confided is a young rake of ftve-ancl-twenty,who, having married a widow of fifty for the sake of her money, finds himself a domestic slave, despised by even his own servants, til], during the period of a short arrest, he contrives to get drunk in a sponging-house, and, returning home, asserts his marital supremacy on the strength of the liquor. At the present day this tale, even with the additional interest of an old gentleman, who first intends to espouse the elderly lady's daughter, but is scared fiem his purpose by the bickerings of the married couple, seems but a meagre foundation for three arts; but there was such a charm in the manner in which Mr. Charles Mathews rattled the chain of domestic captiviiy, rendered fearfully tight by the stern resolution of Mrs. Frank Matthews, that it was impossible for a piece to go off more pleasantly'. Mr. Yotinge, too, was a good hearty' old soul as the venerable suitor; Miss M Oliver was a remarkably spirited young lady, fully determined to have and to manifest a will of her own; Mr. Roxby mads the best he could of the favored admirer, who, as such gentlemen usually' are, is written as the least interesting person in the piece; and .Miss Mason puts forth a proper measure of pertness as one of those sonbrettes who once held a leading position in every comedy, but are now becoming more and more rare upon the British stage. In a word, the whole thing was capitally acted; and Mr. Poole’s dialogue, which, it should be observed, is exceedingly smart, sparkled merrily' on the ears of the audience, A few lines introduced at the beginning, referred to Mr. Charles Mathews’ change from manager of the Lyceum to actor at Drury Lane, and these, of course, elicited an especial roar.
“ Nitocris ’’ is now played at second price. Everything in the way of decoration lias Been done by the manager, and the procession, in which the Egyptian feuds are carried along in a series almost in erimna-ble, is of its kind unique.
As we have said before, the manager need not despair with its present company. He ha-- only to contrast the hearty enjoyment produced by “ Married for Money,’ with the lethargy caused by“ Nitocris” to receive the consolation of a favourable omen.
feeling; some of these allusions were too pointed not to have been intentional on his part, notwithstanding the ingenious way in whieh they were introduced iuto the part he was acting.
The piece in which he appeared wnu a comedy in three acts, called“ Married for Money.” The whole
piece is exceedingly- good ; the pint ic well ec-n«tnietMc!
and clear, the dialogue is lively' and pointed, and many of the situations arc mirth-provoking in the extreme.
The acting was capital—every part had a fitting representative. In the character of Mr. Mopus, Mathews was entirely in his element ; his picture ot the henpecked husband, wincing under a train of unceasing mortifications, while his constitutional gaiety of temper finds vent in rueful jests on his own unhappy plight, was from beginning to and a piece of exquisite comedy. Mrs. Frank Matthews was equally at home in the part of Mrs. Mopns, which she acted with rich and genuine humour. Mr. Roxby played young Royland with manliness and spirit; Mr. Younge made the gouty old wooer abundantly ridiculous ; Miss M. Oliver was pretty and animated as Matilda ; and Miss Mason, as Simpkins the lady’s maid, was one of the smartest soubrettes we have seen. The piece was received with the utmost warmth ; Mr. Mathews was called for at the end of every art; and at the conclusion, the long continued applause brought the principal performers before th. curtain.

The prodigal son of the London theatres, Charles Mathews, has returned from his wanderings in distant parts. We have no reason to suppose that they have proved so very disagreeable, but we are sure that the manner in which he was taken, ho to speak, to the hearts of his old friend» and admirers, last evening, must have been one of the most agreeable incidents of his life. Notwithstanding his irregular ovation on Monday evening, the freshness of his presence did not seem a bit diminished, and he was received with an enthusiasm equal to his deserts. For, after all, there is no denying that in bis line he has at present no equal on the English stage; and that that line, though perhaps not lying amongst the snowy p aks of the very highest ridges of art, does carry us through those bumbler, but less frigid districts, where we all find ourselves more at home and much better amused.

The manager of Drury Lane, Mr. E. T. Smith, need .rot yet despair. By the engagement of Miss Glyn. Mr. Barry Sullivan, Mr. C. Mathews, and the greater part of the old Lyceum company, he has brought together a body of histrionic artists such as has not been seen for years within the walls of Drury Lane.

THE MORNING POST, Oet. 9th.
The .success which lias lately attended the produc ^ ^ tion of pieces as vehicles for extraordinary scenic j’’lld of effects, «orgeousprocessions, and extensively splendid dresses, as well as costly' stage appointments, lias induced the lessee of this theatre, Mr. E. T. Smith, to endeavour, bv an ecpially liberal outlay, to follow ir* tlio eouraf* w hi oh has proved hitherto so remunerative. It must be admitted that the profusion displayed on “ Nitocris,” which was produced for the first time Inst evening, has never been exceeded.
In judging of theatrical pieces, it is always necessary to remember the purpose for which they' arc brought forward, and as that purpose was last night to astonish, by grand scenery and stage contrivances, if the dialogue was sufficient to carry on the story, and sustain the actions during the intervals, it is all that could be reasonably required. But in saying this, we are by no means prepared to admit, as it seems the fashion to assert, that the play-going public want nothing more than show ; and if is assuming too much to ,
play, in five acts, or tableaux, by Mr, Fitzball. This ^ j. play' it appears lias been a long time in preparation ; and, having been much talked of as a piece of a very remarable kind, its production excited no ordinary curiosity, and drew an immense audience, the house being densely crowded in every part. As a scenic spectacle the piece is entitled to the highest praise.
cn a desire to pursue a more legitimate course, though without conceding the principle of cheap admission, which !,• has found to work so satisfactorily.

Strong opportunity foi display is afforded by a libretto of this description, and much lias been done by the manager to produce a glowing series of tableaux illustrative of Egypt and Egyptian life. The locality is far from new as regards pictorial delineation ; for the massive temples of Pliaroah have long been used up by the scene-painters. Tlie learned “ Dykwynkin,” to whom ¡Sir. Smith has assigned the task of superintendence, and whose research in ascertaining the precise characteristics of Egyptian architecture and worship he announces with grandiloquent emphasis, has laboured diligently ; and the accessories of the piece are not only multitudinous, but as accurate, doubtless, as such tilings need to be.

THE TI1HES.
Tntj dawn of Drury Lane, which was rendered so cloudy by the dismal spectacle with which the season commenced grew bright yesterday evening through fbe. genial influence of Mr. Charles Mathews, whose cheerful countenance was discovered on the rising of the curtain, and no sooner beheld than recognized with enthusiastic plaudits from every part of a crowded house.
1 he story of the piece, “ Married for Money,’’ will doubtless be remembered. Its moral is directed against marriages between persons of very unequal age, and the person to whom the task of conveying ethical instruction is confided is a young rake of five-and-twemyjwho, ha ving married u widow of fifty for

Mr. Chinies Mathews made ■ is first appearance ! last night, and had sm h a me piton as has seldom been witnessed. The lu use was so crowded that i» was ditfieiiit to find even standing r- om in any pari : of it. When th< curtain rose Mr. Mathews was ! discovered alone-—a perfect storm of upplausi burs’, from all quarters—peal after peal reiterated for sevei.nl minutes—and when he began to speak, almost every word he uttered was caught up as containing some personal allusion to his own position and nir-cums'ances, and drew forth fresh hursts of popti’ar feeling; some of these allusions were too pointid not to have been intentional on his part, notwithstanding the ingenious way in whieh they were introduced into toe part tie wax acting.

seems but a meagre foundation for three acts , but there was such a charm in the manner in which Mr. Charles Mathews tattled the chain of domesii" captivity, rendered fearfully tight by the stern resolution of Mrs. Frank Matthews, that it was iinpossi •!" for a piece to fo off more pleasantly. Mr. Voting*, too, was a good hearty old soul as the venerable smtor: Miss M Oliver was a remarkably spirited young ¡tidy, fully determined to have and to manifest a will of her own ; Mr. Roxliy made the best he coiiiil of the favored admirer, who, as such gentleuu r usually are, is w ritten as the least interesting person in the piece, and Miss Mas in puts forth a proper measure of pert ness as one of those soubreites who once held a leading position in every comedy, but art now becoming more and more rare upon the Biilisk stage. In a word, the whole thing was capitally acted; and Mr. Poole’s dialogue, which, it should he observed, is exceedingly smart, sparkled merrily on the ears of the audio, e. A few lines introduced at (he beginning', referred to Mr. Charles Mathews’ change from manager of the Lyceum to actor at Drury Lane, and these, of course, elicited an especial roar.

Mrs. Frank Matthews was equally at home in the part of Mrs Mopus, which she acted with rich anil genuine humour. Mr. Roxby played young Roy land with manliness and spirit: Mr. Y ounge made the gouty old wooer abundantly' ridiculous ; Miss M. Oliver was pretty and animated a- Matilda; and Mis.sMason, as Simpkins the lady’s} maid, was one ot the smartest, sonbrettes wc hmi scon. The p’ece was received with the utmost, warmth; Mr. Ma’hews was called for at the end of every act; and at the conclusion, the long continued applause brought the principal performers before the cu ruin.
The announcement of Mr. diaries Mathews’s appearance at this house in a three-act comedy, assisted hyr »rune of the more prominent members of the Lyceum com pan \ , who have faithfully followed i ;i<1 fortunes of their leader, attracted an enthusiastic and overflowing house. “Married for Money,’’ the new piece, is a modern adaptation of ar eider play, “ f he At pal thy Widow; and when Ute curtain drew up upon Mr.Mopus in a drawing-room, which showed that the taste and elegance of the Lyceum had been transp’anted to “Old Drury,” thu warm and protracted welcome of the audience to their old favorite was such as is rarely witnessed in London Again and again the cheers were repeated, arid when at last Mr. Mopus was heard to congratulate himself, on finding tb.v he was in .so handsome a house without any fear having the “ family bills” to pay, thy laughter and cheers were renewed, especially as he naively avowed he had not been able to keep a house of his own over his head. The other Lyceum favorites, Mr. Roxby, Mr*. Frank Matthews, Miss M. Oliver, and Mins Mason, experienced an equally warm reception in their rospecti ve degrees ; arid this tumultuous ovation ovei, the house settled down to the comedy. Its st nicture, plot, and incidents, are exceedingly simple,and admirably adapted to display the peculiar characteristics of the actors engaged in it. The ar-plause and bmgbio- were incessant and genuine. M r Mathews was called at the close of the first act; ihe whole of the principal characters, at the end of the second , and at the close, were again saluted with cordial and unanimous approbation-—a result due not only to the spirit and finish of the actors, but to the brilliancy and point of the dialogue. *' Married for Money ’ is a decided hii. ft may be added, that the new Egyptian piece. “Nito ris,” followed, and that U was again enthusiastically received.
MORNING CHRONICLE*
The prodigal son of the London theatres, Charles Mathews, has returned from his wanderings in distant parts. Vi e have no reason to suppose that they have proved r very disagreeable. but we are sure that the manner in which he was taken, so to speak, to the hearts or his old friends and admirers, last evening, must have been one of the most
contrast the Li
despair with its present company. He has only to I egret-able incident« of lri life. Notwithstanding his i arty enjoyment produced, by“ Married | irregular ovation on Monday evening, (he ti

lie -was received with an enthusiasm equal to bis deserts. For, ..ftcr all, there is no denying that in his line he has a* present no equal ou the English stage: and that that line, though perhaps not lying amongst the snowy js aks of the very highest ridges of art, does carry us through those humbler, but less frigid districts, where we all find ourselves more at home and much better amused. Therefore, are we heartily glad to see Charles Mathews amongst us again. Charies Mathews's Mopus is amongst his best parts , nothing can be more amusing, and at the same iime more true, than bis picture of the “cowed ’ suljvecion of Mopns—his nervous dr<ad of offending his wife—the i nnstraiut of his manner
The announcement of Mr. Charles Mathews’s ap pearance at this house, in a three act comedy, with hi» old friends—hi« envious perception of his assisted by some of the more prominent members of i own degradation — his consequent »elf-contempt the Lyceum company, who have faithfully followed — and the violence of his manner, and hi. the fortunes of (heir ieader, attracted an enthusiastic exaggerated demonstrations of authority n the
and overflowing house. The thing was capitally acted, and Mr. Poole’s dialogue, which, it should be observed is exceedingly .«mart, sparkled merrily .in the ears of the audience. A few hoes introduced at the beginning referred to M r. < harles M.t’hews’s change from manager at the Lyceum to actor at

Charles Mathews never played with more verve and spirit than last night, nor with more suen ss, for. besides’his reception, he was recalled
Drury Lane, and these, of course, elicited an especial ! at the c'ose of each act. Mrs. F. Matthews was an

THE FRA.
On Wednesday evening, to a house crammed, if possible, more compactly than on tbe opening night, Mr. Charles Mathew» made his debut under the present management. And such a debut! No sooner Had the overture ceas« d than the curtain went suddenly up, and discovered the popular comedian alone on the s‘a.ge, seated across a >eversed -hair on the top of which his folded arms rested, and whence he looked upon a wide sea of heads, over which hats and handkerchiefs rolled and ripvded :rt turbulent commotion like that sea tossed into foam. No sooner has lie become thus apparent than an al •» solute bi inbardment of applause is directed against him. He rises, bows, sits, rises again, becomes reseated, and the complimentary bombardment is renewed with increased vigour. ' The very chair on which he sits seems to vibrate with the inmusity o’
| the hearty greeting, and to he getting up some recognition of its own. He recovers oír ■? more his j upright position, renews his bowing, resumes his i s,'at> ‘hen, on his first ejaculation, off goes the | whole house again in a burst of irrepressible erithu-siasri. and the inauguranv« syllable, “ah”' is o-oL ted front tlie context, At last, and apparently from she", physical exhaustion of the audience, a,
I hearing is obtained. His first remark is, “ Ah ! here I am again !’ and the public voice gathering a fresh accesión of power from ih«‘ iap-G of its exercise*
! records it* appreciation of that circumstance in another burst of sonorous enthus asm. “Given up my own establishment, ’ elicits another recognition “Got a large house over my head—wonder how > shall like it !” h accepted as another provocative of ,, response, and finally the congratulatory tone in which the words, “ I shall not have to pay any of ib. “ids, though,” it delivered, brings down a. terrific [outburst of recognition. Similar r.Terences 1o i changes of position are receD.-i with norrm.ponding tokens of their appropriate application being fully understood, and then each succeeding member of ¡he. o te ' yseuin company, as the busbe.-s of the piece leads to their entrance, has his or her share of the honors ol the evening. It may he mentioned advantage that the one scene that suffices for th-' action of the three acts is one of those perfect representations of a drawing-room that, would at once indicate the taste so constantly shown in the stage arrangements of the Lyceum as being airead: <u tivelv manifested in the- same department at this theatre.

MORNING ADVERTISER, Oct.- 9th
Nhoeris, Queen of Egypt, is a sufficiently doubtful personage to give every latitude to a dramatist who desires to weave into his play “ startling incidents, emanating from national and ministerial ,	.	.	.	., jealousies, love, ambition, and implacable revenge.”

pauses, in a succession of scenes, which from their gorgeousnesg or grandeur, entirely absorb the attention, some striking situations are elicited, and vehement dialogues drawn out. The long announced spectacle last night overflowed its gorgeousness, its learning, and its wonders on the stage of Drury Lane

Therefore it is that the great success of spectacle is more the fault of writers for the stage than those who patronise the theatre.
Li the banquet scene a ballet, was introduced, which was very chararacteristic, and seemed to have p been composed upon the Egyptian forms which we are in the habit of seeing in the museums. The attitudes were very well kept, and the corps dc hollct deserve great praise foi the spirited manner in which they (lanced, and the evident determination they displayed to sustain the peculiarity of their evolutions.

THE SUN, Oct, 9th-
Mr. E. T. Smith, the indefatigable and enterprising less, commenced his regular dramatis season last night, and so crowded an audience has seldom been assembled within the walls of “ Old Drury as met together last night to greet him. The play announced for representation was a new original Egyptian drama, lrom the pen of I'itzbail, entitled “ Nitocris : ” and, for the mysterious placards that have for some time past been posted in the most public places, great, curiosity had been excited ; and we are bound to say, on the whole, that curiosity lias not been disappointed, for the play in question is one of the most novel productions that lias taken place for years.
THE GLOBE, Oct- 9th.
Mr. L. T. Smith, in organising his forces for a winter campaign at Drury Lane, lias formed a coalition. comprising several of the specialities of the modern London stage. From the Lyceum he has taken, not only light comedy, hut some of its choicest representatives, in the persons of Mr. Charles Mathews, Mr. Roxby, Miss Oliver, and Mrs. Frank Matthews. llis scenic and classical illustrations, as well as his playbills, are upon the Princess's model.

The promises, as merely with the regal and priestly pomp, but with largely indulged in on paper, have been fclflled oh
the domestic manners, customs, and habits of the ancient Egyptians. With so many authentic pictures to guide and direct, we are not surprised to find that in this spectacle we are presented with a series of
the stage of Drury Lane Theatre, by Mr. Smith, who inaugurated his season with a spectacle novel as interesting, and as correct in every detail as care, erudition, and an unlimited outlay can make it. Tin-

BELL’S LIFE IN LONDON, 14th.
On Monday Mr. E. T. Smith commenced his winter season by producing his wonderful Egyptian play of“ Nitocris/' which has been months in pre-. . ,	,	. para'ion. The scenery was well painted, particu-
which the worthy Lessee nas expended somewhere }ar]v the jnlfriorSl but that in which the conspirators betw-eer, two and three thousand pounds.

THE RACING TIMES, Oct. 9th.
We have given a hasty sketch of the drama as written, and will now endeavour to describe the manner in which it has been put upon the stage. In one word then, we may say that it is the most magnificent spectacle that we have ever seen upon the

So great was the excitement on the opening night that even standing -.-coin was hardly procurable, and Nitocris in the person of the cele-t.ilkerj of Egyptian play called “Nitocris.” As a j brated Miss Glynn, secured the plaudits of one of the spectacle, we pronounce “ Nitocris” to be a theatrical [largest audiences ever assembled within tbe walls of

REYNOLDS NEWS, Oct, 14th.
Mr Smith commenced his winter season on Monday last, having engaged a company of such strength as is not only calculated to elevate the character of the theatre, but likewise remunerate the lessee for his enterprise. The season was inaugurated by the long-
won der,
Drury Lane.
nor do we think th.it the coronation scene was ever surpassed in the grand display it made of gorgeous and massive objects, when they were all arranged before the final appearance of the king and queen and the fall of the curta-'n. The music was characteristic. The whole play has been most expensively and cleverly got up, in token of which Mr. E. T. Smith was called on to receive the congratulations of the audience. The house was completely filled in every part.
THE WEEKLY TIMES, Oct. 14th.
“ Nitocris, Queen of Egypt,” the grand pageant so universally announced, and so long expected, was produced at this theatre on Monday last, with an amount of splendour and archailogical labour which finds no parallel in the History of spectacle. The lessee deserves the thanks and aid of the public for his enterprising spirit.
THE PRESS, Oct. 14th.
After a long preparation, the new Egyptian drama, the result of Mr. Smith’s “researches in Herodotus,
1 tenons, Wilkins-ill, and the libraries and museum* of London and Paris,” was brought out. on Monday night. Taken as a spectacle, “ Nitocris” answers its end. The banquet room in tin- Grotto of Mernnon has, to us, by far the richest effect.

THE TIMES.
1 h e dawn -i Drury Lane, which was rendered so cloudy by (hr dismai spectacle, with which the season commenced, grew bright yesterday evening through tin- iri oial influence .■ ■ Mr. Charles Mathews, whose cheerful countenance was discovered on the rising of the curtain, and on sooner beheld than recognized j with enthusiastic plaudits from every part of a crowded house.
d he story of the piece, “ Married for Money,’’ will doubtless be remembered. Its moral is directed against marriage* between persons of very unequal ego, and the person to whom the task ot conveying ‘«tin -a! instruction is confided is a young rake of five-and-twenty.who. .mving- n. ; i-rip.l r* xvirlnxx ,,t fifty C,r the sake of her money, finds himself a domestic j slave, despised by even his own servants, till, -Hiring I the period of a short arrest, he contijvck to get. drunk [ in a sponging-house, and, r-turnimr home, «»sorts, h.s marital supremacy on the strength of the liquor. 1 At the present day this tale, even with the additional { interest of an old gentleman, who first intends to es-pon«e the elderly lady's daughter,but is scared firm his purpose by the bicker in rs of tis«-- married couple,! seems but. a meagre foundation for three acts; but there was such a charm in the manner in which Mr. Charles Mathew« rattled the chain of domestic captivity, rendered fearfully tight by- tho stern inso-)nt.„n of Mrs. Frank Matthews, that, it was impossible for a piece to go off more pleasantly. Mr. lounge,
’ ' . was a good hearty old sou! as the vei-er-dilt- | suitor; Miss M Oliver was a remarkably spirited j young lady, fully determined to have and to manifest j a will of her own ; Mr. Roxby made the best he could n[ the favored admirer, who, as such gentlemen I usually are, -s written as tbe least interesting person in the piece : and Miss Mas .in puts forth a proper nteasure of pertnoss as one. of those soubrettes who once held a leading position in every comedy, but are now becoming more and more rare upon tbe British stage. In a word, the whole thing was capitally acted; and Mr. Poole’s dialogue, which, it should be observed, is exceedingly smart, sparkled merrily on the ears of the audience, A few lines introduced at ;he beginning, referred to Mr. Charles Mathew*’ change from manager of tbe Lyceum to actor at Drury Lane, and these, of course, elicited an especial roar.
“ Nitocris’’ is now played at ««cond price. Everything in the way of decoration has been done by the manager, and Lie procession, in which the Egyptian sods are carried along in a series almost interminable, is of its kind unique.
As we have said before, the manager .iced not despair with its present company. He has only to contrast the hearty enjoyment produced by “ Married for Money,’ with the lethargy caused by“ Nitocris” to receive tlm consolation of a favourable omen.
THE GLOBE.
Mr. Charles Methews made his first appearance at Drury Lane last night, and experienced a very warm reception,
TMJE .»*’
The announcement of Mr. Charles Mathews’s appearance at this house, in a three act comedy, assisted by some of the more prominent members of tho Lyceum company, who have faithfully followed the fortunes of their leader, attracted au enthusiastic and overflowing house. The tiling was capitally acted, and Mr. Poole’s dialogue, which, it should be observed is exceedingly smart, sparkled merrily on the ears of the audience. A few lines introduced at the beginning referred to Mr. Charles Mathews’s change from manager at the Lyceum to actor at Drury Lane, and these, of course, elicited an especial roar.
WJEEIAFY DISPATCH.
On Wednesday Mr. Smith brought forward the comic part of his company. The house, as on Monday, was crowded in every part. The novelty was an altered version of the “ Wealthy Widow”— n comedy some twenty years old, which has been com pressed and almost re-written for the present occasion. Mr, Mathew* received a hearty welcome, the applause was continued for several minutes, and only ceased to be followed by loud laughter when he commenced the piece by pointed allusions to Iris own situation. He had got into a handsome house, and had no longer to pay the bills, and he wondered il he should be as much liked as formerly—remaiks which were cleverly contrived to serve a double purpose. Mr Mathews appeared before the curtail! after each act,and at the conclusion the applause was very warmly bestowed.
I.F.OYI»’» MEWSPAPER.
On Wednesday, Charles Mathews met with a most uproarious welcome in a new adaptation ot Poole’s “ Wealthy Widow,” re-christened“ Married for Money.” Never did Mathews play with finer humor ; never did audience more abundantly sympathise with their favorite. Mr. Mopus is, of course, henpecked, and endures his fate with most comic resignation His allusion* to debt and difficulties were keenly relished both by himself and audience. Indeed, .Mathews makes only a huge joke of the Queen’s Bench, and dives and gambols in the ocea-.i ot debt like a dolphin in the summer s-a. To him a writ on’y conveys a jest, and a sheriff’s officer is the younger brother of Momus. Altogether the piece went off with abounding good humor.
T18E DAILY HEWS. IHORM1KG AMVEÏITI»!:«.
Mr. Charles Mathew made, his first appearance last nigh I, and bad - ucii a reception as has seldom-been witnessed. The L- use was so crowded that it was difficult to find even standing room in any part of it. When the curtain rose Mr Mathews was discovered »lone—a perfect storm of applause burst from all quarters—peal after peal reiterated for several minute*—and wiien he began to speak, almost every word he uttered was caught up as containing some personal allusion to his own position and circumstances, and drew forth fresh hursts of popular feeling; some of these allusions were too pointed not to have been intentional on his part, notwithstanding itie ingenious way in wliieli niev were introduced iuto the part he was acting.
The piece in which he appeared was a comedy in three acts, called “ Married for Money.'' The whole piece is exceedingly good ; the plot is well constructed and clear, th« dialogue is lively and pointed, and many of the situations are mirth-provoking in the extreme.
The acting was capital—every part had i lifting representative. In the character of Mi. Mopus, Mathews was entirely in his element, his pictur« of tho henpecked husband, wincing under a train of uncaasing mortifications, while his constitutional! gaiety of temper finds vent in rueful jests on his own unhappy plight, was from beginning to end a piece of exquisite comedy. Mrs. Frank Matthews was equally at home in the part of Mrs. Mopus, which she acted with rich and genuine humour. Mr. I'.oxby played young Royland with manliness and spirit; Mr. Younge made the gouty old wooer abundantly ridi- ulcus ; Miss M. Oliver was pretty and animated as Matilda , and Miss Mason, as Simpkins the lady’s maid, was one of the smartest soubrettes we have seen. The p’oee was received with the utmost warmth ; Mr. Mathews was called for at ihe end of every act; and at the conclusion, the long continued applause brought the principal performers bpfore the curtain.
MORNING CHROMCI i:.
The prodigal son of the London theatres. Charles Mathew-, has returned from hi* wanderings in distant parts. We have no reason to suppose that (hey have proved so very disagree able, hut we are sure that the manner in which he was taken, so to speak, to the hearts of his old friends and admirers, last evening, must have been one of the most agreeable incidents of his life. Notwithstanding his irregular ovation on Monday evening, the freshness of his presence did not seem a bit diminished, and he was received with an enthusiasm equal to his deserts. For, after all, tln-re is no denying that in his line he has at present no equal on the Enalish stage; and that 1 liat line, though perhaps not lying amongst the snowy p aks of the very highest ridges of art, does carry us through ihoso humbler, but less frigid districts, where we all find ourselres more at > home and much better amused. Therefore, are we heartily glad to see Charles Mathews amongst ns l again. Charles Mathews’s Mopus is amongst, his 1 best parts nothing can be more amusing, and at j the same time more true, than his picture of the ¡•‘cowfd ’ suljecriou of Mopus—his nervous dread ! of offending his wife—the constraint of his manner with his old friends—hi» obvious perception of his own degradation—his consequent self-contempt — and the violence of his manner, and his exaggerated demonstrations of authority in the last s*ene, are not loss eminently characteristic of the progress from slavery to tyranny. We feel at every step he takes that he is aghast at his own boldness. Charles Mathews never played with more verve and spirit than last night, nor with more success, for, besides his reception, he was recalled at the close of each act. Mrs. F. Matthews was ari admirable Mrs. Mopus; and Mr. Roxby and Miss Oliver, as tho liners, showed that they had not suffered by their transplantation.
It will be seen that Mr. Smith has now amongst hi« company the principal members of the late Lvceum company; and when to them we add the names of Miss Glyn and others, now engaged in the Egyptian drama, it is obvious that old Drury has now again a company capable of things not altogether unworthy its ancient reputation. We shall see how the lessee uses his resources.
THE PRESS.
- On Wednesday Mr. Charles Mathews made his first appearance in a revival of the comedy of the ¡‘Rich Widow,” under tho title of " Married for Money.” The brilliancy of the dialogue, and the excellent acting of Mr. Mathews and Mrs. Frank Matthews kept the audience in roars of laughter during the whole of the play. A few lines introduced at the beginning of the first, scene, alluding to Mr. Matthews’s appearance in a “new house,” with some amusing hints at “ bills,” “ tradesmen,” and “embarrassments,” were eagerly caught at by the audience, who showed their pleasure at again meeting an old favorite by hearty and continued applause.
REYAOLR^ MEW».
On Wednesday, Mr. C. Mathews, and the principal- of the Lyceum company, appeared in a piece called “Married for Money,” and experienced a hearty reception in their new locality. The play is a lif.-like picture of those domestic bickerings invariably attendant upon il’-assurted marriages, and the acting of it kept the audit-nco in continuous laughter. The houses have been excellent during j the week.
The announcement of Mr. Charles Mathew-'« appearance at this house i:i ,t three-act comedy, assisted by- *- me of the moie prominent member- of the Lyceum compam , who have faithfully followed the fortunes of their leader, attracted an enthusiastic and overflowing house. “Married for Money,” the new piece, is a modern adaptation of an older play, “ The Wealthy Widow.” and when tho cnrtai.i drew up upon Mr.Mopus in a drawing-room, winch showed that the taste and elegance of the Lyceum had been transplanted to “Old Diury,” the warm and nro-tracted welcome of the. audience to their old favorite was such a- i.-> rarely witnessed in London. Asain ana ag;l,n tub etieers were repeated, and when at last. Mr. Mopns was heard to congratulate bin.wit, on finding that lv> was in sn handsome a house without any fear having the “ family bill«” to pay, the laughter and cheers were renewed, especially as he naively avowed lie had not been able to keep a house of his own over his head. The other Lyceum favorites, Mr. Roxliy, Mrs. Frank Matthews, Miss M. Oliver, and Miss Mason, experienced an equally warm reception in their respei live degrees ; and this tumultuous ovation over, tbe house settled down to the comedy. Its structure, plot, and incidents, ar< exceedingly simple, and admirably adapted to display the nermliar characteristics of the actors engaged in it. The applause and laughter were incessant and genuine. M r Mathews was t - led at the close of the first act; the whole of fhe principal characters, at the end ot the second; and at the close, were «gain sainted with cordial and iinanir.-ius approbation—a result, dun not only to the spirit and finish of the actors, but 1<> the brilliancy and point of the dialogue. “ Married for Money ” is a decided hit. L may be added, (hat the new Egyptian piece. ” Nitocris,” followed, and that it was again enthusiastically received.
THE E3U.
On M ednesday evening, to a house crammed, if possible, more compactly than on the opening night. Mr. Charles Mathews made his debut under the present management. And such a debut! No sooner had tho overture ceased than the curtain went suddenly up, and discovered tlie popular comedian alone on tbe stage, seated across a reversed chan, on the top of which his folded arms rested, and whence he looked upon a wide sea of heads, over which bats and handkerchiefs rolled and rippled in turbulent commotion like that sea tossed into foam. No sooner has he become thus apparent than an al -solute bombardment of applause is directed against bun. He rises, bows, sits, rises again, becomes reseated, and the complimentary bombardment is renewed with increased vigour. The very- chair f :x which lie sits seems to vibrate with the intensity of the hearty greeting, and to be getting up some recognition r»f its own. He recovers once more his upright position, renews his bowing, resumes hi« seat, and then, on his first ejaculation, off goes the whole house again in a burst of irrepressible enthusiasm, and the inaugurative syllable, “ah1’ is isolated from the context. At last, and apparently from sheer physical exhaustion of the audience, a hearing is obtained. His first remark is,“ Ah 1 here I. am again !’ and the public voice gathering a fresh accession of power from the lapse of its exercise, records its appreciation of that circumstance in 1 another burst of sonorous enthusiasm. “Given «p my own establishment,” elicits another recognition. “Gota large house over my head—wonder°how I shall like it!” is accepted as another provocative of a response, and finally the congratulatory tone in which the words, “ I shall not have to pav any ot the hills, though,” is delivered, brings down «. terrific outburst of recognition. Similar references to chauges -if position arc received with corresponding I tokens of their appropriate application being fu!E -understood, and then each succeeding member of tin. lato Lyceum company, as the business of the piece leads to their entrance, has his or her share of the honors of the evening. It may be mt ntioned to advantage that the one scene that suffice* for tjlP action of the three acts is one of those perfect representations of a drawing-room that would at once indicate the taste so constantly shown i-i the stage arrangements of the Lyceum as being already actively manifested in the sauin department at tbl-. theatre. Each evening during tho week the comedy lias been repeated, and crowded audiences and hearty approvers have attested the judgment of ji.e lessee and the unmingled satisfaction ihat the performances have given.

THE WEEKLY TIME,»,
Mr. Charles Mathews made his first appeal a nee on Monday, in what we must- call a new comedy, entitled “ Married for Money.’ The favorite actor most have been highly satisfied with his reception, than which nothing could have been more cordial. When the curtain rose, lie was discovered alone, and i a hurricane of applause burst from every quarter, i rising peal after peal, and lasting for several minutes. Some lines in the opening contained allusions to his change from the position of manager of the Lyceum to actor at Drury Lane, and they were caught up by ! the audience with great gusto and friendly feeling, j Mr. Charles Mathews was in Lis best vein, and presented an exquisitely comic picture of (lie henpecked husband. The piece was perfectly successful We never saw a house more densely packed.

THE MORNING POST, Oct. 9th.
The MORNING HERALD, Oct. 9th.
Mr. E. T. Smith has commenced his winter season at this theatre under more enterprising circumstances than hitherto, and the arrangements he has made betoken a desire lo pursue a more legitimate course, though without conceding (lie principi« of cheap admission, which he has found to work so satisfactorily. He has now plunged into tfte higher responsibilities of management, and proposes while leaning for support upon the temptation of spectacle, to cultivate coinci-
play, in five acts, or tableaux, by Mr. Fitzball. This play it appears has been a long time in preparation ; and, having been much talked of as a piece of a very remarable kind, its production excited no ordinary curiosity, and drew an immense audience, tbe house being densely crowded in every part. As a scenic
—.	spectacle the piece is entitled to the highest praise dem] with it no less a commod!ty than poHte comedy

In the banquet scene a ballet was introduced,
who desires to weave into bis play “ startling incidents, emanating from national and ministerial jealousies, love, ambition, and implacable revenge.” We dont know that a Shakspeare or a Sophocles could render the human events of a gorgeous spectacle
interesting; suffice it, that in the few interstices or pauses, in a succession of scenes, which from their gorgeousness or grandeur, entirely absorb the attention, some striking situations are elicited, and vehement dialogues drawn out. The long announced spectacle last night overflowed its gorgeousness, its learning, and its wonders on the stage of Drury Lane. — -	,	j i and more than realised all that had been expected of

Strong opportunity for display is afforded by a libretto of this description, and much has been done by tin manager to produce a glowing series of tableaux illustrative of Egypt, and Egyptian life. The locality is far from new as regards pictorial delineation ; tor the massive temples of Pharosli have long been used up by the scene-painters. The learned “ Dykwynkin," to whom Mr. Smith has assigned the task of superintendence, and whose research in ascertaining the precise characteristics of Egyptian architecture and worship he announces with grandiloquent emphasis, has laboured diligently ; and the accessories of the piece are not only multitudinous, but as accurate, doubtless, as such things need to be.

REYNOLDS NEWS, Oct. 14th.
Mr. Smith coimne-ieed 1 «i-s winter season on Monday last, having engaged a company of such strength as‘is not only calculated to elevate the character of the theatre., but likewise remunerate the lessee for his enterprise. The season was inaugurated by the long talked of Egyptian play called “ Nitocris.” As a spectacle, we pronounce " Nitocris” to he a theatrical wonder,	__
interest. The Egyptians of the time oi’ Pliaroah lived again : and, as far as learning ami deep research availed, they were surrounded by wonted objects and wonted scenery. In an original Egyptian play entitled “ Nitocris,” Mr. Fitzball showed the London public of 1855 how queens reigned four thousand years ago. So great was the excitement on the opening night that even standing room was hardly procurable, and Nitocris in the person of the cede- of London and Paris,” was brought out nn Jjjonday orated Miss Glynn, secured the plaudits of one of the night. Taken as a spectacle, “ iNitocris” answers largest audiences eyer assembled within tb«s walls of j its end. The banquet room in the Giotto ofMenincn Drury Lane.	| has, to us, by far the richest effect.
finds no parallel in the history of spectacle. The lessee deserves the thanks and aid of the public for his enterprising spirit.

FIRST APPKARAYCE I N
THE TIMES.
The dawn of Drury Lane, which was rendered si cloudy by the dismal spectacle with which the season commenced, grew bright yesterday evening through 'he g -nial influence of Mr. Charles Mathews, whose cheerful countenance was discovered on the rising of the curtain, and no sooner h.-bold than recognized with enthusiastic plaudits front every part of a crowded house.
The story of the. piece, “ Married for Money,” will doubtless be remembered. Its moral is directed against marriages between persons of very unequal
«vjg,. , an-! tfir j.jcj?5t.m tu vi hum iiie LuS’k uf conveying
ethical instruction is confided is a young rake of five-and-twrmy,who, having married a widow of fifty for the sake c-t her money, finds himself a domestic slave, despised by even his own servants, till, during t lie period of a short arrest, he contrives to get drank in a sponging-house, and, returning h«'me, asserts his marital supremacy on the strength of the liquor. At the present day tins tale,even with the additional interest of an old gentleman, who first intends to espouse the elderly lady’s danghtei .but is scared ft. ut his purpose by the bickerings of the married couple, seems but a meagre foundation for three acts: but there was such a charm in the mariner in which Mr. Chari es Mathews rattled the chain of domestic captivity, rendered fearfully tight by the stern resolution of Mrs. Frank Matthews, that it was impossible for a pit-cm to go off more, pleasantly. Mr. Yonnge, too, was ¡1 good hearty old soul as the veni-rable snior; Miss M Oliver was a remarkably spirited young lady, fully determined to have and to manifest a will of her own ; Mr. Roxby made the best lie could of the favored admirer, who, as such gentlemen usually are, is written as the least interesting person in the piece; and Miss Mason puts forth a proper measure, ef pertness as one of those soubre tte.s who once held a leading position in every comedy, but are now becoming more and more rare upon the British stage. In a word, ihe whole thing was capitally acted; ami Mr. Poole's dialogue, which, it. should he observed, is exceedingly7 smart, sparkled merrily on the ears of the audience. A few lines introduced at the beginning, referred to Mr. Claries Mathews’ change from manager of the Lycetm to actor at Drury I ane, and these, of course, elicited an especial roar.
“Nitoc is- is now played at second price. Everything in the way uf decoration lias been done by the manager, and the procession, in which the Egyptian .gods are carried along in a series almost interminable, is of its kind unique.
As we have said before, the manager need not despair with its present company. He has only to contrast the hearty enjoyment produced by “ Married for Money,' with the lethargy caused by - Nitocris" to receive the t-« ¡isolation of a favourable omen.
THE HAIIiY KJKWS.
M r. Charles Mathews made his first appearance last night, and had suelt a reception tin has seldom been witnessed. The bouse was so crowded that it was difficult to find even standing room in any part of it. When the curtain rose Mr. Mathews was discovered alone—a perfect storm of applause burst from all quarters—peal aftei peal reiterated for sevc al minutes—and when he began to speak, almost o\ try word he uttered was caught up as containing some personal allusion to Ins own position and circumstances. and <1r«-w forth fresh bursts of popular feeling; some of these allusions were too pointed not to have been intentional on his part, notwithstamung the ingenious way in which they wore introduced into the part he was acting.
The piece in which he appeared was a comedy in three acts, called“ Married for Money.” The whole piece is exceeditigl v good ; the plot is well construct« d and clear, the dialogue is lively an 1 pointed, and many of the situations are mirth-provoking in the extreme.
The acting was capital——every part had a fitting representative. In the character of Mr. Mopus, Mathews was entirely in his element; his picture »f the henpecked husband, wincing undei a train of unceasing mortifications, while his constitutional gaiety of temper finds vent in rueful jests on his own unhappy plight, was from beginning to end a piece of exquisite comedy. Mrs. Frank Matthews was equally at home in the part of Mrs Mopus, which I she acted with rich and genuine humour. Mr. Roxby played young Roy land with manliness and spirit; Mr. Younge made the goaty old wooer abundantly ridit ulous ; Miss M. Oliver was pretty and animated as Matilda; and Miss Mason, ns Simpkins the lady’s maid, was one of the smartest soubrettes we have seen.

Th a announcement of ¡Mr. Charles Mathe-ws's appearance at tin- house 'ii a three-act comedy, assisted by sour- of tin- more prominent, members of the Lyceum compan- . who have faithfully followed the fortunes of their leader, attracted an enthusiastic and overflowing house. “Married for Money,’’ the u-w piece, i « a modern adaptation of an older play, “The Wealthy ’Widow:’’ and when the curtain drew up upon Mr.Mnpus in a drawing-room, which showed that the taste and eh-gance of the Lyceum had been transplanted to “Old Drury ” 1 fin warm and protracted welcome of the. audience to tlmir old favorite was such as is rarely witnessed in Loudon Again and again the elicers wen- repeated, and when at last Mr Mopes was heard to congratulate himself, on finding tha' lie was in so handsom - a house without any fear having the “ family bills” to pay, the laughter and cheers were renewed, «'specially as lie naively avowed he had n- t been abb to keep a house oi his own over his head. The other Lyceum favorites, Mr. Boxliy, Airs. Frank Matthews, Miss M. Oiivi-r, arid Miss Mason, experienced an equally warm reception in their respective degrees ; and this tumultuous ovation over, the house settled down to the comedy. Its structure, plot, and incidents, are exceedingly simple, and admirably adapted to display the peculiar characteristics of the actors engaged in it. The applause arid laughter were incessant and genuine. Mr Mathews was called at the close of the first act; the whole of the principal characters, at the end ot the second ; and at the close, were again saluted with cordial and unanimous approbation—a result due not only to the spirit and finish of the actors but to the brilliant-) and point of tin dialogue. “Married for Money” is a decided hit. It may be added, that the new Egyptian piece. “ Nitocris,” followed, and that it was again enthusiastically received.

Mr. Charles Muthews made his first appearance ad Drury Lane last night, and experienced a very warm reception.
THIS su*\
The announcement of Mr. Charles Mathews's appearance at this house, in a. three act comedy, assisted by some of the more prominent members of the Lyceum company, who have faithfully followed the fortunes of their leader, attracted an enthusiastic and overflowing hou-ir. The thing was capitally acted, and Mr. Poole’s dial cue, which, it should he observed is exceedingly smart, sparkled merrily on the. ears of the audience. A few lines introduced at the beginning referred to Mr. Charles Mathews’s change from manager at the Lyceum to actor at Drury Lane, and these, of course, elicited an especial roar.
WEEKLY DISPATCH*
On 'Wednesday Mr. ¡Smith brought forward the comic part of his company. The house, as on Mond ay, was crowded in every part. The novelty was an altered version of the “ Wealthy YV idow”— a comedy some twenty years old, which has been compressed and almost re-written for the present occasion. Mr. Mathews received a hearty welcome, the applause was continued for several minute.-, and only ceased to be followed by loud laughter when he commenced the piece, by pointed allusions to his own situ -.lion. He had got into a handsome house, and had no longer to pay the bills, and he wondered it he should be ns much liked a.s formerly—remarks which were cleverly contrived to serve a double purpose. Mr Mathews appeared before tbe curtain after each act,and at the conclusion the applause was very warmly bestowed.
MO U % E .V *» C i-s RO ICS, sc.
The prodigal son uf the London theatres, Charles Mathews, has returned from his wanderings in distant parts. We have >.o reason to suppose that they have proved so very disagreeable, but we are sure that, the manner in which he. was taken, so to speak, to the hearts o' bis old friends and admirers, lust evening, must have been one «if tbe most affreeuble incidents of it's life. Notwithstanding ids irregular ovation on Monday (. veiling, the fresknes.-. of his presence did not seem a bit diminished, and he was received with an enthusiasm equal to bis deserts For, after all, there is no denying that in his line be has at present no equal on the Eue i»h stage , and that ¡hat line, though perhaps not lying amongst the snowy p aks of the very highest ridges of art, does carry -is through ¡host humbler, but less frigid districts, where we all find ourselves more at home and much better amused. Therefore, are we heartily glad to see Charles Mathews amongst us again. Charles Mathews’s Mopus is amongst iris best parts ; nothing ca«r he more amusing, and at the same time more true, than his picture of the “cowed’’ subjection of Mopus—his nervous dread of offending his wife—the constraint of his manner ’with his old friends—his obvious peroepiion f his own degradation — his consequent self-contempt — and the violence of his manner, and his exaggerated demonstrations of authority in tin-last seeue, are not less eminently characteristic jf the progress from slavery to tyranny. W’e feel at every step he takes that he is aghast at his own boldne.-s. Charles Mathews never played with more verve and spiri' than last night, nor with more success, for, besides his reception, he was recalled at the close of each act. Mrs. F. Matthews was an admirable Airs. Mopus; and Mr. Roxhy and Miss Oliver, as the loters, showed that they had not suffered by their transplantation.
It will be stun that Mr. Smith lias now amongst his company the principal members of the late ¡Lyceum company ; and when to them we add the naun-.s of Miss Glyn and others, now engaged in tht-Egyptian drama, it is obvious that old Drury has now again a company capable of things not altogether unworthy its ancient reputation. V« e -hall see how the lessee uses his resources.
LLOYD’» YEWSPAPEB.
On Wednesday, Charles Mathews met with a most uproarious welcome in a new adaptation of Poole’s “ Wealthy Widow,” re-christened “ Married for Money.” Never did Mathews play with finer humor, never did audience more abundantly sympathise with their favorite. Mr. Mopus is, of course, henpecked, and endures his fate with most omic resignation His allusions to debt and difficulties were keenly relished both by himself and audience. Indeed, Mathews makes only a huge joke of the Queen’s Bench, and d.ves and gambols in the ocean or debt like a dolphin in the summer s-n..

THE FRK$S.
On Wednesday Mr. Charles Mathew» made his first appearance in a revival of the comedy of the ‘ Rich Widow,” under the title of “ Married for Money.” The brilliancy of the dialogue, and the excellent acting of Mr. Mathews and Mrs, Frank Matthews kept the atidiem-e in roars of laughter during the whole of the play. A few lines introduced at the beginning of the first scene, alluding to Mr. Matthews’s appearance in a “new house,” with some amusing hints at “ bills,” “ tradesmen,’ and ' embarrassments,” were eagerly caught ..t by the audience, who showed their pleasure at again meeting an Id favorite by hearty and continued applause.
THE ERA.
On Wednesday evening, to a house crammed, if possible, more compactly than on the opening night, Mr. Charles Mathews made bis debut under the present management. And such a debut! No sooner had the overture ceased than the curtain went suddenly up, and discovered the popular comedian alone on the stage, seated across a reversed chair, on the top of which bis folded arms rested, and whence In* looked upon a wide sea of heads, over whir!« ha is and handkerchiefs rolled and rippled in turbulent commotion like that sea tossed into foam. No sooner has lie become thus apparent than an absolute bombardment, of applause is directed against him. He rises, bows, sits, rises again, becomes reseated, and the complimentary bombardment is renewed wilb increased vigour. The very chair on win h he sits seems to vibrate with the intensity of the. hearty greeting, and to be getting up some recognition of its own. He recovers once more bis upright position, renews his bowing, resumes his seat, a. id then, on his first ejaculation, «iff goes the whole house again in a burst of irrepressible enthusiasm, and the inaiigurative syllable, “ah:' is isolated from the context. A! last, and apparently irons sheer physical exhaustion of the audience, a bearing is obtained. His first remark is, “Ah! here I am again'” and the public voice gathering a fresh accession of power from the lapse of its exercise, records its appreciation of that circumstance in another burst of sonorous enthusiasm. “Given up my own establishment-, ’ elicits another recognition. “Guta large house over my head—wonder" how 1 shall like it!’’ is accepted as another provocative of a response, and finally the congratulatory tone in wliuli the words, “I shall not have to pay any of the bills, though,' is delivered, brings down a terrific outburst oi recognition. Similar references to abutmes ol position are received with corresponding token» of their appropriate application being fully understood, and then each succeeding member of the late Lyceum company, as the busin-ss ot the piece u-ads to their entrance, has his or her share of 1he honors of the evening. It may hr- mentioned to advantage that the one scene that suffices for the action of the three acts is one of those perfect representations of a drawing-room that would at ..nice indicate the taste so constantly shown in the stage J arrangements of tBe Lyceum as being already actively manifested in ihe same department at this theatre. Each evening during the week the comedy has been repeated, and crowded audiences and hearty approvers have attested the judgment of the lessee and the unmi igled satisfaction that the performances have given.

BHYiYOLDD’S YEWS.
On Wednesday, Mr. C. Mathews, and the priu-! cipals of the Lyceum company, appeared in a piece called “Married 1er Money,” and experienced a hearty reception in their new locality. The play is j a lif--like picture of those domestic bickerings i invariably attendant upon il’-ass .rted marriages,
I and the acting of it kept the audience in continuous laughter. The houses bave been excellent during ' the week.
T M E W t: K M. L Y T £ HUES,
Mr. Charles Mathews inad«.- his first appearance on Monday, in what we must call a new comedy, entitled “ Married for Money.” The favorite, actor must have been highly satisfied with his reception, than which nothing could have been more cordial. When the curtain rose, lie was discovered alone, and a hurricane ot applause burst from every quarter, rising peal after peal, and lasting for several minutes. Some lines in the opening contained .illusions to his change from the position of manager of the Lyceum to actor at Bmry Lane, and they were caught up by ihe audience with great gusto and friendly feeling. Mr. Charles Alaihews was in his best vein, and presented an exquisitely comic picture of the henpecked husband. The piece was perfectly successful We never saw a house more densely packed.

THE TIMES, Oct. 9th.
The manager of Drury Lane, Mr. E. T Smith, need not. yet despair. By the engagement of Miss Cdvn Mr. B.ury Sullivan, Mr. C. Mathews, and the greater part of'the old Lyceum company, he has brought together a body of histrionic artists such, as has not been seen for years within the walls of Drury Lane.
THE MORNING POST, Oct. 9th.
The success which has lately attended the produc-tiUM KjC pXOCCS ctS vehicles for extraordinary scenic ! effects, gorgeous processions, and extensively splendid dresses, as well as costly stage appointments, nas induced the lessee of this theatre, Mr. E. T. Smith, to endeavour, by an equally liberal outlay, to follow in the course which has proved hitherto so remunerative. It must be admitted that, the profusion displayed on “Nitocris,” which was produced for the
first time last evening, has never been exceeded. In judging of theatrical pieces, it is always necessary to remember the purpose for which they are brought i that purpose was last night to astonish,
THE DAILY NEWS, Oct. 6th.
This theatre opened last night for the winter season with “ Nitocri»,” a new and original Egyptian play in live acts, or tableaux, by Mr. Fitzball. This play it appear* has been a long time in preparation ; and, having been much talked of as a piece of a very remarable kind, its production excited no ordinary curiosity, and drew an immense audience, the house being densely crowded in every part. .As a scenic spectacle the piece is entitled to the highest praise. It is not only rich, splendid, *nd beautiful, but must be regarded as a faithful and vivid delineation of “ the existed in tile »M days of the
jarrl of Egypt" äs it

The MORNING HERALD, Oct. 9th.
Mr E. T. Smith has commenced his winter season at this theatre under more enteipming circumstances than hitherto, and the arrangement • lie has made betoken a desire t< pursue a more legitimate • -tiw>e* though without conceding the principle of cheap admission, which lie has found to work so satisfactorily, lie has now plunged into the higher responsibilities of management, and proposes, while leaning for support upon the temptation of spectacle, to eultivalu coincidently with it no less a commodity than polite comedy and the more delicatee piot es of the French school. The company he has engaged for tlu. prosecution of this double scheme is, os times go, ot a very respectable character ; and the aggregate expenses af a speculation so obviously large and important will test the virtue of economical prices to an extent in which is yet there has been no experience. Mr, Smith certainly deserves the e.nin icnance of the many, lie has catered sedulously for their amusement, and he has been fettered by no “ compunctious visitings ” as regards the class of entertainment which he has set
dia
forward, and as...	,	,	„	,
by grand scenery and stage contrivances, if the logue war. sufficieat to carry on the story, and siiM.on the actions during the intervals, it :s all that could be reasonably required. But in saying this, we ..ro
Pharoahs. The buildings, the decorations temples and the palaces, the grim uncouth idols, the arms of the soldiers, the attire of the various classes of men and women—every object, in short, animate and inanimate, is placed before our eyes with a truth and reality which must have been the result of unwearied research and consummate graphic skill.
Two scenes in particular—the banquet in the grotto of Memnn, ami the concluding scene of the corona- i |jeyore them, notwithstanding the Shakesperh.r, effigy tion—have scarcely ever, we belie ie been exceeded	gtj]j crcsf the portico ot'the house outside, end

by no means prepared to admit, as it seems the fashion 1 to assert, that the play-going public want nothing more than show ; and it is assuming too much to say that really legitimate writing will not meet witn due encouragement until the trial has been made.
No one can tell what, the conduct of the public will be until they have had an opportunity ot deciding.
This has certainly not been the case for some time
past, foi the pieces which have 1'een produced, if jealousies, love, ambition, and implacable revenge." they were formed of good materials, were	so clumsily	'	r$re dont know that a Shakupearc or a Sophocles

’	*	"	pauses, in a	succession of scenes, which from their
<0 gorgeousness >r grandeur, entirely absorb the attention, some .-finking situations are elicited, and velie-
arc remote from the old notions of legitimacy : but each successive effort, whether it bo an English or a German opera, a inn.sk- d ball, or a troop of horse-riders. has won its coaspnvotive degree of profit ; and a .-ixpenny gallery and a shilling pit have paid the way. Now, however, the cards played are oi <i different colour. An attempt is contemplated which we shall lie glad to see successful ; for though the
•workman in that respect, depended tor their mily substance upon frog-sized ideas, so blown out bovine proportions as to tie totally unbearable. Therefore it is that the great success of spectacle is more the fault of writers for the stage than those v, ho
patronise the theatre.	_
In the banquet scene a ballet was introduced, which was very chararacteristic, and seemed to have been composed upon the Egyptian forms which vee are in tho habit of seeing in the museums, t he attitudes were very well kept., and the corps tie half ft deserve great praise for the spirited manner in which they danced, and the evident determination they displayed to sustain the peculiarity of their evolutions. Miss Rosina"Wright was very successful as the principal dancer, and obtained considerable applause.
The scenery was well painted, particularly the interiors; but that in which the conspirators were drowned was remarkably successful, and was the most perfect attempt at introducing water upon the stage which was ever produced ; and the groups of dead, .men through the transparent mediums which rose up 1 1 rough the stage with the electric light upon them, was admirably effective; nor do we think that the coronation scene was ever surpassed in the grand , display it made of gorgeous and massive objects, when I ».	--,- were all arranged before the final appearance ot
the king and queen and the fall of the curtain, fhe writing was suited to the style of the piece. 1 he imi'ie was characteristic. rl he whole play has been most expensively and cleverly got up, in token of which Mr. E. T( Smith was called on to receive the congratulations of the audience. The house was completely filled in every part.
THE SUN, Oct. 9th-
Mr. E. T. Smith, the indefatigable and enterprising less, commenced his regular dramatic season last night, and so crowded an audience has seldom been assembled within the walls of “ Old Drury ’ as met together last night to greet him. The play announced for representation was a now original Egyptian drama, from the pen of Fitzball, entitled “ Nitocris ; ” and, for the mysterious placards that have for some time past been posted in the most public places, great curiosity had been excited; and we arc bound to say, on the whole, that curiosity has not been disappointed, for the play in question is one e' the most novel productions that has taken place for years.
MORNING ADVERTISER, Oct 9th-
Nitocris, Queen of Egypt, is a sufficiently doubtful personage to give every latitude to a dramatist	^
who desires to weave into his play “startling >nci- . •” gg cannot omit resorting to Ins old methods in dents, emanating from national and ministerial; courtjnp the popular patronage to wine! something
of the spirit of Barnumism is but too visible, the aim itself is good and honorable, and may possibly t< id to revive the interest in our national drama.
Strong opportunity for display is afforded by a libretto of this description, and much has been done by the manager to produce a glowing series of tableaux illustrativi ot Egypt and Egyptian life. The locality is far from new as regaids pictorial
ment dialogues drawn out. The long announced spectacle last night overflowed its gorgeousness, its learning, and its wonders on the stage of Drury Lane, and more than realised all that had been expected of it. We conscientiously proclaim for “Nitocris,” Queen of Egypt, a success monstrous and proportionate t,o its own vast resources.
delineation ; for the massive temples of Bharoah have long been used up by the scene-painters. The learned “ Dykwynkin,’ to whom Mr. Smith lias assigned the task of superintendence, and whose research in ascertaining the precise characteristics of I Egyptian architecture and worship he announces with I grandiloquent emphasis, has laboured diligently • and the accessories of the piece are not only multitu linous, but as accurate, doubtless, as such things need ro be.
THE ERA, Oct 9th.
The strength of the piece lies in the spectacular portion of it, and there is a sufficiency of excellence about it to repay by its attraction the vast outlay by which surpassing brilliancy has been achieved. A pretty characteristic ballet, in winch Miss K osina "Wright, the first of our English dancers, has a bizarre , opening pas sevl, singularly effective in style and clever in atKl display of scenery rivalling ¡lie celebrated proexecution, may be reserved for special mention as an ¿notion of “ Sardanapalus ” at the Royal I* nicess’s important element of popularity in the piece. Since j Theatre. Indeed, in one point, but that a very the first night some advantageous improvements have important one. Drum-lane Theatre has rather the taken place, and the lavish applause throughout, and advantage of its rival, the continuous calls for the manager every evening to respond to a public acknowledgement of his liberality,
THE MORNING CHRONICLE, Oct, 9th.
After eighteen months of preparation the grand Egyptian drama was produced last evening at the of this theatre for this season, with a pomp
hows that “Nitocris” maybe safely admitted into the category of successes by which the “Smith” dynasty has been distinguished.
THE OBSERVER, Oct- 7th-
The field chosen by Mr. Fitzball is free from doubt : the explorations in the tombs and temples of Egypt have n.ade us intimately acquainted, not merely with the regal and priestly pomp, but with .he domestic manners, customs, and habits of the ancient Egyptians. With so many authentic pictures to guide and direct, we are not surprised to find tba' in this spectacle we are presented with a series of pictures which are well calculated to afford an accurate conception of that country, the vicissitudes of which are so deeply associated with the interesting incidents of sacred and profane, history.
THE WEEKLY DISPATH, Oct. 14th
Enormous affichesand innumerable advertisements in the papers have for months informed us of the i intended production of an Egyptian spectacle, by Mr. Fitzball, called “ Nitocris ” in which much expense was to be incurred and much learned research engaged to revive in exact imitation, the gigantic monuments of Egyptian splendour, and the curious symbols of Egyptian superstition. The promises, as largely indulged ir, on paper, have been fulfill'd i-a the stage of Drury Lane Theatre, by Mr. Smith, who inaugurated his season with a spectacle novel as interesting, and as correct in every detail as < arc, erudition, and an unlimited outlay can make it. The seenery is admirable; the coronation «rne is extraordinarily effective, occupying as it does the whole, depth of the stage, which is completely covered with oilcloth.

parano», j ne scenery was mu pam.i-u, p.uuvulari y the interiors, but that in which the conspirators drowned was remarkably successful, and was
* the stage which was ever j of dead, seen through the
representatives, in the persons of Mi. Charles Mathews, Mr. Roxby, Miss Oliver, and Mrs. Frank Matthews. His scenic and classical illustrations, as well as his playbills, are upon the Princess’s model. The high tragedy element is represented by Miss Glynn. Covent Garden is emulated in respect of sta'ce effects. The ballet has its upholder in the best of Knglieh dancers, Miss Rosina "Wright; while the strongly spiced Surreyan drama is—with due regard to the gods and to low prices—personified by Mr. Fitzball. The opening play was the “ Egyptian drama,” of which we have so long heard mysterious announcements. As regards the scenery, we can an]v say that it appears quite as accurate and beautiful "a. any Egyptian illustrations that we have seen.

WEEKIY DISPATCH.

induced the lessee ot this theatre, Mr. E. I	arms 0f ,he gold;ers [ic attire of the various classe
to endeavour, by an equally liberal outlay to follow , of mcm and women_every object, in short.,
in the course which has proved hitherto so remunerative. It must be admitted that the profusion displayed on “ Nitocris,” which was produced for the first time last evening, has never beon exceeded. In judging of theatrical pieces, it is always necessary to remember the purpose for which they are brought forward, and ns that purpose was last night to astonish, by grand scenery and stage contrivances, if the dialogue was sufficient to carry on the story, and sustain the actions during the intervals, it is all that could be reasonably required. But in saying this, we are by no means prepared to admit, as it seems the fashion to assert, that the play-going public want nothing more than show; and it is assuming too much to say that really legitimate writing will not meet with due encouragement until the trial has been made. No one can tell what the conduct of the public will be until they have had an opportunity of decioing. This has certainly not been the cast for some time past ; for the pieces which hare been produced, it thoy were formed of good materials, were so clumsily ■joined as to present ho well-connected appearance, &nd others, in which there were signs of a skilful workman in that respect, depended for their only substance upon frog-sized ideas, so blown out to bovine proportions as to be totally unbearable. The-, ■.'fore it is that the great success of spectacle is more the fault of writers for the stage than those who patronise the theatre.	_
Tn the banquet scene a ballet was introduced, which was very chararacteristic, and seemed to have

classes ¡mate
and inanimate, is placed before our eyes with a truth and reality which must have bscn the result of unwearied research and consummate graphic skill. Two scenes in particular-—the banquet in the grotto of Memon, and the concluding scene of the coronation—have scarcely ever, wo believe been exceeded in magnificence. The whole performance was received with great applause ; and we trust that the run of the piece will amply repay the great expense and care winch the lessee must have bestowed on its production.
MORNING ADVERTISER, Oct- 9th-
Nitocris, Queer, of Egypt, is a sufficiently doubtful personage to give every latitude to a dramatist who desires to weave into his play “ startling incidents. emanating from national and ministerial jealousies, love, ambition, and implacable revenge.” We dont know that a Shakspeare or a Sophocles could render the human events of a gorgeous spectacle interesting ; suffice it, that in the few interstices or pauses, ;n a succession of scenes, which from their gorgcou3ness or grandeur, entirely absorb the attention, some striking situations are elicited, and vehement dialogues drawn out. The long announced spectacle last night overflowed its gorgeousness, its learning, and its wonders on the si oge of Drury Lane, and more than realised all that had been expected of

The latitudes were very well kept, and the corps de bahet deserve great praise for the spirited manner in which they danced, and the evident determination they displayed to sustain the peculiarity of their evolutions. Miss Rosina Wright was very successful as the principal dancer, and obtained considerable applause.
The scenery was well painted, particularly the interiors but that in which the conspirators were drowned was remarkably successful, and was the most perfect attempt at introducing water upon the stage which was ever produced ; and the groups of dead, seen through the transparent mediums which rose up through the stage with the electric light > pon them, was admirably effective ; nor do we think (bat. the < donation scene was ever surpassed in the grand display it made of gorgeous and massive objects, when
THE ERA, Oct. 9th.
The strength of the piece lies in the spectacular portion of it, and there is a sufficiency of excellence about it to repay by its attraction the vast outlay by which surpassing brilliancy has been achieved.

To all the lovers of the wonderful the proceedings at Drury Lane, on Monday night, must be rife with interest. The Egyptians of the time of Pharoah lived again ; and, as far as learning and deep research availed, they were surrounded by wonted objects and wonted scenery. In an original Egyptian play entitled “ Nitocris,” Mr. Fitzball showed the London public of 1B55 how queens reigned four thousand years ago. So great was the excitement on the opening night that even standing room was hardly’ procurable, and Nitocris in the person of the celebrated Miss Glynn, secured the plaudits oi' one of tlie spectacle, we pronounce “ Nitocris” to be a theatrical | largest audiences ever assembled within the walls of wonder,	j Drury Lane.

The MORNING HERALD, Oct. 9th.
Mr E. T. Smith has commenced his winter season at this theatre under more enterprising circumstances than hitherto, and the arrangements lie has made betoken a desire to pursue a more legitimate, course, though without conceding the principle of cheap admission, which he has found to w ork so satisfactorily. He has now plunged into the higher responsibilities of management, and proposes, while leaning for support upon the temptation of spectacle, to cultivate coincidently with it no less a commodity than polite comedy and the more delicatee pieces of the French school. The company’ he has engaged for the prosecution of this double scheme is, as “dues go, of a very respectable character ; and the aggregate expenses af ✓ speculation so obviously t«r-c ana important will test the virtue of econorniral prices to an extent in which ns yet there has been no experience. Mr. Smith certainly desorves the countenance of the many’. He lias catered sedulously for their amusement, and he has been fettered !y no “ compunctious visitings ” as regards the class of entertainment which he has set before thorn, notwithstanding the Shakespcrian effigy which still crest the portico of the house outside, and the equally significant figures within. The vicissitudes of vocation to which “her Majesty's servants ” are exposed are av multifarious in complexion as they are remote from the old notions of legitimacy ; but each successive effort, whether it be an English or a German opera, a masked ball, or a troop of horse-riders, has won its comparative degree of profit ; and a sixpenny gallery and a shilling pit have paid the way. Now, however, the cards played are of a different colour. An attempt is contemplated which we shall be glad to see successful; for though the lessee cannot omit retorting to his old methods in courting the popular patronage, to which something of the spirit of Barnumiain is hut io<, visible, the aim itself is good and honorable, and may possibly tend to revive the interest in our national drama.
Strong opportunity for display is afforded by . libretto of this description, and much lias been done by the manager to produce a glowing series of tableaux illustrative of Egypt and Egyptian life. The locality is far from new as regards pictorial delineation : for the massive temples of Pharoah have, long been used up by the scene-painters. The learned “ Dykwynkin,” to whom Mr. Smith has assigned the task of superintendence, and whose research in atcertaining the precise characteristics of Egyptian architecture and worship he announces with grandiloquent emphasis, has laboured diligently ; and the accessories of the piece arc not only multii udinous, but as accurate, doubtless, as such things need to be.
THE MORNING CHRONICLE, Oct. 9th.
After eighteen months of preparation the grand Egyptian drama was produced last evening at. the opening of this theatre for this season, with a nomp and display of scenery rivalling the celebrated production of “ Sardanapalus ” at the Royal Princess’s Theatre. Indeed, in one point, but that a very important one, Drury-lane Theatre has rather the advantage of its rival.
THE WEEKLY DISPATH, Oct. 14th
Enormous cfficheh and innumerable advertisements in the papers have for months informed us of the intended production of an Egyptian spectacle, by Mr. Fitzball, called “ Nhocris,” in which much expense was to be incurred a id much learned research engaged to revive in exact imitation, the. gigantic monuments of Egyptian splendour, and the curious symbols of Egyptian superstition. The promises, as largely indulged in on paper, have been fill filed ira the stage of Drury Lane Theatre, by Mr. Smith, who inaugurated bis season with a spectacle novel aa interesting, and as correct in every detail as care, erudition, and an unlimited outlay can make it. Tho scenery is admirable; the coronation scene is extraordinarily effective, occupying as it does the whole depth of tne star,.’, which is completely coveri d with oilcloth.
BELL’S*LIFE IN LONDON, 14th.
On Monday Mr. E. T. Smith commenced his winter season by producing his wonderful Egyptian play of “ Nitocris,” which has been months in preparation. The scenery was well painted, particularly the interiors, but that in which t he conspirators were drowned was remarkably successful, and was the most perfect attempt at introducing water upon the stage which was ever produced, and the. groups of dead, seen through the transparent mediums which rose up through the stage with the new electric light, upon them, was admirably effective ; nor do we think that the coronation scene w as ever surpassed in the grand display it made of gorgeous and massive objects, when they were all arranged before the final appearance of the king and queer, and the fall of the curtain The music was characteristic The whole play ha. been most expensively and cleverly got up, in token of which Mr. E.

THE WEEKLY TIMES, Oct. 14th.
“ Nitocris, Queen of Egypt,” the grand pageant so universally announced, and so long expected, was produced at this theatre on Monday last, with an amount of splendour and arcbselogieal labour which finds no parallel in the history of spectacle. The lessee deserves the thanks and aid of the public for his enterprising spirit.

Mr. CHARLES MATHEWS’
FIRST APPEARAYCB IS
TIf 13 TIMES.	I
The dawn of Drury Lane, which was rendered so cloudy by (hr dismal spectacle with which the season commenced, grew bright yesterday evening through the genial influence of Mr. Charles Math‘ws, whose cheerful countenance was discovered on the rising of the curtain, and no sooner beheld than recognized with enthusiastic plaudits from every part, of a crowded house.
Thw story of the piece. Married for Money’,'’ will doubtless be remembered. Its moral is directed against marriages between persons of very’ unequal age, and the person to whom the task of conveying einteai instruction is confided is a young rake of hve-and-twenty,who, having married a widow of fifty for the -;ake of her money, finds hiuisvlf a domestic slave, despised by even his own servants, till, during the period of a short arrest, he contrives to get drunk in a spomging-house, and, returning home, asserts his marital supremacy on the strength of the liquor. At the j resent day thin tale, even with the additional interest of an old gentleman, who first intends to espouse the elderly lady's daughter, but is scared ft cm Ins purpo’i by the bickerings of the married couple, | seems but a meagre foundation for three acts , but i there was such a charra in the manner in which Mr. Charles Mathews rattled the chain of domestic captivity, rendeicd fearfully tight by the »tern resolution of Mrs. Frank Matthews, that it was impossible for a piece to go off more pleasantly Mr. Tom-ge, too, was a good hearty old soul as the venerable suitor; Mis» M Oliver was a remarkably spirited young lady, fully determined to have and ,o manifest a will of her own; Mr Roxby made the best he could of the favored admirer, who, as such gentlemen usually are, is written as the le-ist interesting person in tlie piece; and Miss Mason puts forth a proper measure of pert ness a» one of those soulrcttes who once held a leading position in every comedy, but are now becoming more and mure rare upon the British stage. In a word, the whole thing was capitally acted; and Mr. Poole’s dialogue, which, it should bo observed, is exceedingly smart, sparkled merrily on the ears of the audience. A. few lines introduced at the beginning, referred to Mr. Charles Mathews’ change from manager of the Lyceum to actor at Drury Lane, and these, of course, elicited an especial roar.
“ Nitocris’' is now played at second price. Everything ill the way of decoration bas been done by the manager, and the procession, in which the Egyptian gods are carried along in a series almost interminable, is of its kind unique.
As we have said before, the manager need not despair with its present company. He has only to contrast the hearty enjoyment produced by “ Married for Money,’ with the lethargy caused by Nitocris” to receive the consolation of a favourable omen.

Air. Charles Muthews made his first sppearanee at Drury Lane last night, and experienced a very warm reception.
TUE
The announcement of Air. Charles Mathews'* appearance at this house, in a three act comedy, assisted by some of the more prominent members of the Lyceum company, who have faithfully followed the fortunes of their leader, attracted an enthusiastic and overflowing house. The tiring was capitally ■acted, and Mr. Poole’s dialogue, which, it should he observed is exceedingly smart., sparkled merrily on the ears of the audience. A few lines introduced at the beginning referred to Mr. Charles Mathews’s change from manager at the Lyceum o actor at Drury Lane, and these, of course, elicited an eapeoial roar.
WEEKLY RI8PATCH.
On Wednesday Mr. Smith brought forward the comic part of his company. Th# house, as cn Monday, was crowded in every part. The. novelty was an altered version of the “ \V ealthy \A idow”— a comedy some twenty years old, which has be#n compressed and almost re-written for the present occasion. Mr. Alathews received a hearty welcome, the applause was continued for several minutes, and only «’.eased to be followed by loud laughter when he commenced the piece by pointed allusions to his own si'uation. He had got into a handsome house, and had no longer to pay the hills, and he wondered if he should be as much liked as formerly—remarks which were cleverly contrived to servo a doubh purpose. Mr Alathews appeared before the curtain after each act, and at the conclusion the applause was very warmly bestowed.
LLOYD’S NEWSPAPER.
On Wednesday, Charles Mathews met with a most uproarious welcome in a new adaptation of Poole’s “ Wealthy Widow, ' re-christened“ Alurried for Money. ’ Never did Mathews play with finer humor ; never did audience more abundantly sympathise with their favorite. Mr. AIupus is, of course, henpecked, and endures his fate with most comic resignation HG allusions to debt and difficulties were keenly relished both by himself and audience. Indeed, Alathews makes only a huge joke of the Queen's Bench, and dives and gambols in the ocean of debt like a dolphin in the summer Sia. To trim a writ on’y conveys a jest, and a sheriff's officer is the younger brother of Momus. Altogether the piece went off with abounding good humor.
TISiK DAILY XE,WrS'
Mr. Charles Mathews made his first appearance last night, and had such a reception as has stblom been witnessed. The house was so crowded that it 1 was difficult to find even standing room in any part ! of it. When the curtain rose. Mr. Mathews was discovered alone—a perfect storm of applause Durst from all quarters—peal after peal reiterated for several minutes—-and when he began to speak, almost every word he uttered was caught up as containing some personal allusion to his own position and eir-cumstances, and drew forth fresh bursts of popular
fooling . anmo of Ojovu dUunionu	too poinf«ii not" j
to have been intentional on bis part, notwithstanding the ingenious way in which they were introduced iuto the part he was acting.
The piece in which he appeared was a comedy in ; three acts, called “ Married for Money.” The whole l piece is exceedingly good; the plot is well constructed and clear, the dialogue is li ’ely and pointed, and many of the situations arc mirth-pri yoking in the extreme.
The acting was capital—every part bad a fitting ¡representative. In the character of Mr. Mopus, Mathews was entirely in his element; his picture #f the henpecked husband, wincing under a train of unceasing mortifications, while his constitutional gaiety of temper finds vent in r icful jests on his own unhappy plight, was from beginning to end a piece of exquisite comedy. Mrs. Frank Matthews was equally at home in the part of Airs. Mopus, which she acted with rich and genuine humour. Mr. Roxby played young Royland with manliness and spirit; Mr. Younge made the gouty old wooer abundantly | ridiculous ; Miss Al. Oliver was pretty and animated | as Alatilda; and Miss Mason, as Simpkins the lady’s! maid, was one of the smartest soubrettes we have i seen. The piece was received with the utmost warmth , Mr. Alathews was called for at the end of every act; and at the conclusion, the long continued j applause, brought the principal performers before the curtain.
*101*Sb EAG C/ftlRDA1CLE«
The prodigal son ot the London theatres, f harles Mathews, has returned from iiis wanderings in dis-| lant parts. AYe have no reason to suppose, that they have proved so very disagreeable, but we are sure that the manner in which he w as taken, so to speak;, to the hearts cf his old friends and admirers, last evening, must have been one of the most agreeable incidents of his life. Notwithstanding ins irregular ovation on Monday evening, the freshness | of his presence did not seem a bit diminished, and ^ he was received with an enthusiasm equai to his' deserts. For, after all, there is no denying that in his line he has at present no equal on the English stage ; and that that line, though perhaps not lyinu amongst the snowy peaks of the wry highest ridges of art, does carry us through those humbler, hut less frigid districts, where we all find ourselves more at home and much better amused. Therefore, are we heartily glad to see Charles Alathews amongst us again, Chari«* Mathews’s Mopus is amongst his best parts; nothing can be mor# amusing, and at the same time more true, than his picture of the “cowed ’ subjection of Mopus—his nervous dread of offending his wife—the constraint of his manner with his old friends—his obvious perception of hia own degradation—his consequent, self-contempt — and the violence of his manner, and his exaggerated demonstrations of authority in the last s«ene, are not ¡ess eminently characteristic of the progress from slavery to tyranny. We feel at every step) he takes that he is aghast at his own boldness. Charles Mathews never played with more verve and spirit than last night, nor with more success, for, besides his reception, he was recalled at the close of each act. Mrs. F. AIatth»ws was an admirable Mrs. Aluptis; and Air. Roxby and Miss Olivar, as the lovers, showed that they had not suffered by the’r transplantation.
it will be seen that Mr. Smith has now amongst his company the principal members of the late Lyceum company’: and when to them we add the names of Miss Glyn and ethers, now engaged in ¡he Egyptian drama, it is obvious that old Drury has now again a company capable of things not altogether unworthy its ancient reputation. AYe shall see how | the lessee uses his resources.	i
THE PRE^.
On Wednesday Air. Charles Mathews made his first appearance in a revival of the comedy of the ‘Rich Widow,’’ under the title of ‘Married for Money." The brilliancy of the dialogue, and the excellent acting of Mr. Mathews and Mrs. Frank Matthews kept the audience in roars of laughter during the whole of the play. A few lines introduced at the beginning of the first scene, alluding to Mr. Matthews’s appearance in a “new lions«,” with some amusing hints at “ bills,” “ tradesmen,” and “embarrassments,” were eagerly caught at by the ' audience, who showed their pleasure at again meeting an old favorite by hearty and continued applause.
j REYAOLDS’S MEWS.
On Wednesday, Air. C. Alathews, and the prin-j cip&l- of the Lyceum company, appeared in a piece I called « .Married fer Money,” and experienced a, hearty reception in their new locality The play is a lifi -like picture of those domestic bickerings invariably attendant upon il'-assorted marriages, and the acting of it kept the audience in continuous laughter. The houses have been excellent during the week.
MOUMiAG ADVERTI»EV¿
The announcement of Mr. Charles Math,<eWs appearance at this house in a three-act oo»a»e<fys assisted by sonic of the more prominent members rf the Lyceum company, who have faithfully followed the fortunes of their leader, attracted an ent husiastie and overflowing house. “Married for AI onev ’’ the new piece, is a modern adaptation rf an older play “ The Wealthy Widow;’’ and when the ■curtain drew up upon Mr.Mopus in a drawing-room, which showed that the. taste and elegance of the Lyueum had been transplanted to “Old Drury,” thu warm and pro-«-•I»®...- Vi-- «..Jioaic thvif old favorite was such as is rarely witnessed in London Agai.x and again the cheers were repeated, arid when at last Air. Mopus was heard to congratulate himself, on finding that he was in sn handsome a house without any fear having the “ family bills” to pay, the laughter and cheers were renewed, especially as he naive!:-avowed he had not been able to keep a house of hit" own over his bead. The other Lyceum favorite» Mr. Roxby, Airs. Frank Matthews, Miss M. Oliver! and Miss Mason, experienced art equally warm reception in their respective degrees ; and this tumultuous ovation over, the house settled down to the comedy. Its structure, plot, and incidents, are exceedingly -¡triple, and admirably adapted to display ihe peculiar
characteristics of the actors engaged in it. The applause and laughter were incessant and genuine. Air Mathews was called at the close of the first act; the whole of the principal characters, at the end ot the second; and at the dose, were again saluted with cordial and unanimous approbation—-a result due not only to the spirit and finish of the actors, but to the brilliancy and point of the dialogue. “ Married for Money ” is a decided hit. It may be added, that the new Egyptian piece, “N.tocris, followed, and that it v as again enthusiastically received.
the era.
On Wednesday evening, to a house crammed, if possffile., more compactly than on th.' opening night, Mr. Charles Mathews made his debut under the present management. And such a debut! No sooner had the overture ceased than the curtain went suddenly up, and discovered the popular comedian a.one on the Htage, seated across a reversed chair orx the top of which his folded arm« rested, and whence he looked upon a wide sea of head», over winch hats and handkerchiefs rolled and rippled in turbulent commotion like that nea tossed into foam.
, sooner has he become thus apparent than an also.ute bombardment of applause is directed against «¡im. He rises, bows, sits, rises again, becomes reseated, and the complimentary bombardment is renewed with increased vigour. The very chair on which he sits seems to vibrate with tho intensity of the hearty greeting, and to be getting up some recognition °f its own. He recovers once more his upright position, renews his bowing, resumes his seat, and then, on bis first ejaculation, off goes the whole house again in a burst of irrepressible enthusiasm, and the inaugurative syllable, “ah1'’ is isolated from the context. At last and anparently trom sheer physical exhaustion of the audience, a hearing is obtained. His first remark is, “ Ah ! here 1 am again J” and the public voice gathering a fresh accession of power from the lapse of its exercise records Us appreciation ol that circumstance in another burst of sonorous enthusiasm. “Given no my own establishment,” elicits another recognition. “ Got a large house over my head—wonder bow f shall like it ! ’ is accepted as another provocative of a response, and finally the congratulatory tone in which the words, “I shall not' have to pay tfny of Ue though,” is delivered, brings down a terrific outburst of recognition. Similar references to chauges ot position are received with corresponding tokens of their appropriate application being fully understood, and then each succeeding member of tho late Lyceum company, as the business of the piece loads to their entrance, ha*- hi» or her share of th« honors of tho evening. It may be mentioned to advantage that the one scene that suffices for the action of the three acts is une of those perfect representations of a drawing-room that would at oneo indicate the taste so constantly shown in the stage arrangements of the Lyceum as being already actively manifested in ¡hr same department at this theatre. Each evening during the week the comedv has been repeated, and crowded audiences and hearty approvers have attested the judgment of the lessee and the unniingled satisfaction that the performances have given.	r
THE WEEKLY TIMES*
Mr. Charles Mathews made his first appearance on Monday, in what we must call a new comedy, entitled “ Married for Money.” The favorite actor must have been highly satisfied with his reception, than which nothing could have been more cordial! When the curtain rose, he was discovered alone, and a hurricane of applause burst from every quarter, rising peal after peal, and lasting for several minutes! Some lines in tho opening contained allusions to hia change from the position of manager of the Lyceum to actor at Drury Lane, and they were caught up by the audience with great gusto and friendly feeling. Mr. Charles Mathews was in his best vein, and presented an exquisitely comic picture of tho henpecked husband The piece was perfectly successful We never saw a house more densely packed.

“ Worshipped by the inhabitants of Ihebais (Plutarch).
The Asp was sacred to this God.	(
The Ark, (bearing his hieroglyph, with that of the Beetle oi “Creative power,”) is also decorated with this emblem.

THE SYBIL bearing the emblematic rush wand, with “ lleka,” “ The F rog” (the son of “ Num”), and type of the first state of man.
No. 2. “MA," “ MEII,” or “ THMEI." Or “Truth,” “ the Blind Goddess,” represented with her eyes closed, or blinded.
The Priests bearing this Goddess have libation buckets and simpula.
“THMEI,” or TRUTH or JUSTICE, This deity had also a twofold character, as Goddess of Truth and Justice. A small image of this God was worn ny the Chief Judge while engaged in listening to cases brought before him.
A similar emblem was worn by the High Priests of the Jews, and it is remarkable that the word “ Thummim” is not only translated “Truth;” but, being a plural or dual word, corresponds to the Egyptian word of “ Two Truths"—i.e. “ Light and Truth.” Breastplates having the figures of the two Gods “Re ” (Light) and “ Thmei” (Truth) represented upon them have been discovered.
Priests with Scarabjei.
The Scaraheus may be considered as a* «mblem of “The Sun” —of “ The Creative power”—and of the God “ Pthah” (Vulcan).
Incense Bearer,
Waving his incense patera before the God. The incense was in the shape of a small globe or pill ; and. upon modern analysis, is found to consist of aromatic substances with gum, and gave out colored light or flame when thrown into the burnning cup.
No. 3. “APIS." His titles in hieroglyphs were “The Sacred Bull of Memphis,” “ The Bull of Abundance, adored by the People,” “ The Sacred Bull of Pthah,” “ Guardian of the Solar Year,”
‘ Apis renowned over the World,” “ The Symbol of Inundation.”
Richly draped and on a car led by Priests bearing the emblems of “ Scrapis,” or “Sari Api,’ “The Pillar of Mensuration ”—“Column of Measurement,’’ or “ Niiometer,” of wood divided into cubits.
Attendant Priests also fan the Idol and offer homage as it passes forward.
The festivals in honor of Apis lasted 7 days, on which occasion a large concourse of people assembled at Memphis—the Priests led the Sacred (living) Bull in solemn procession, every one coming forward from their houses to welcome him.
Pliny and Solinus affirm that children who smelt his breath were thought thereby gifted with the power of predicting future events.
The tokens which distinguished this sacred Bull at its birth were a white spot resembling a crescent on its right side, and a lump under its tongue in the form of a Beetle—as pretended by the Priests. The people believe him to be the cause of the swelling and inundatioa of the Nile, which produced fertility and abundance, and celebrated his festival at about the period of this annual occurrence with every demonstration of rejoicing and litoral abandonment to the intoxication of joy all over the kingdom.
Many temples were erected and dedicated to “Apis,” and one also to “ Serapis,” the Divinity of the Column of Measurement—the Niiometer !
N.B.—The decorations of the drapery upon the Bull and Carriage are principally composed of the first flowers that spring from the earth after the recession of the flood, i.e. the Lotus and Meliolotus.
Priests with the “ i rktended” God “ Canopus,” or Water offering to the God of the Nile.
« It rs said, that the Chaldeans, transporting the fire, which was their God, into all the provinces, offered to let him combta with those of other nations, on condition that if he remained the conqueror, they should adore him. The Priests of Canopus accepted the challenge and devised this stratagem. They fabricate in Egypt pitchers of an extremely porous earth, through which the water filtrates and is purified. The Arch-priest took one of them, stopped the pores with wax and painting it of various colors, filled it with water and made it his God. He covered it with the head of an ancient, statue, said to be that of the pilot Menelaus. The Chaldeans presented themselves ; the contest began, they lighted their fire around the vase: the wax melts, the water runs through the pores and extinguishes the tire. The fraud of the Priest gave the victory to Canopus over the Chaldean deity. From that moment his image has been represented with very short feet, a narrow neck, and the belly and back rounded like a pitcher. It is under this form that he is worshipped as the vanquisher of all the Gods.’’—Ruffin Hi stair e de V Eglise, lieresectmd.
No. 4. THE GODDESS‘‘FASH-T,’’ “The Memphian Lioness,” “ The beloved of Pthah, “ The Goddess of Fire,” “ Bubastes " (the Diana, of the Greeks), preceded by sacred dancers. The Idol carried by Priests in their Leopard-skin dresses, with red incense flaming before her, and surrounded by “Symbolic Divinities,” “Winged Geniuses,” &c.
One of the principal festivals held in Egypt was at Bubastis in honor of Pasht—700,000 persons of both sexes being present, A great number of victims were sacrificed, wine was profusely drank, dancing of the wildest character went forward, men played flutes, women sang and shrieked as loud as possible, struck the “ Crotola ” (Symbals) or Clappers of wood and metal, &c.
Lotus Dancers (females).
Incense Bearers,
No. 5. THE GOD “OSIRIS,” as “Osiris Pethempaiiient.es” (the Pluto of the Greeks), “He who is Resident in the Hades,” “President of the Amend,” “ .Receiver and Giver,” “The Sun,” “ The Eye of the World,” “ The source of the Nile,” “ He who has many Eyes,” a form of Ammon, wearing the “ Atf," and having the Crook and flagellum. Regarded as “ The author of time,” from the words “ Osch-Iri,” “The maker of time.”
The principal office of this Deity was to Judge the Dead, and to rule over that kingdom where the souls of good men were admitted to eternal felicity.
This licit' was very famous, his Temples and Priests were to be found in almost every part oi Egypt, the sacred rites of Osiris were a profound mystery, never revealed. IIis name even avoided, as of too august a nature to be mentioned.
The “ Ivy,” with which the Priests decorated themselves was sacred to him, and also the “ Meliolotus.’
Bo. 6. THE SACRED BOAT 01 THE AMENTI, or Lower Regions,
with the Four Genii, or Demi-Gods (bearing emblems of Life and Power) and their vases of “Amenti," or that subterraneous region where tiiev (the Egyptians) imagined the souls ot the dead to go after their decease.
The 1st genius is “ Amset ” “ -Judge of the Amenti. ’ (Human-headed.)
The 2nd is “Hepi,” “Concealed Number.” (Baboon-headed.)
The 3rd is “ Tuautmutf.” “ Adorer of his Mother.” (Jackal-headed.)
The 4th is “ Kabh-senuf," “ Refresher of his Brethren. ’ (Hawk-headed.)
The Sepulchral Vases have heads in shape of the Four Gerii of the Dead, and each was employed for holding a portion of the Visera 0f the deceased, embalmed separately and deposited in them. On the “ Amset ” Vase is inscribed the speech of “Isis” to the dead ; on that, of “Hepi” is a similar speech from “ Nepthys; 1 on that of “ Tuautmutf,” one from “Keith ; ’’ and on that of “ Kabh-senuf,” one. from “Seik.” The purport of each being an Assurance of Protection, and of being “near thee ” “ beside thee,” or “ f come to be beside thee.”
The. Sacred Boat is followed by the symbolic “ Eyes a! Osiris," or, of “The Sun,” emblems of the all-seeing presence -.f the Divinity.
HSNote.—Beside the Four Amend, there were 42 Assessors or Judges of the Forty-two Crimes, from which i good man should be free, and these also differ from the 36 Demons mentioned by Orige.n, that presided over the human body and were invoked to ■ are the infirmities of the peculiar member immediately under their protection.
No. 7. THE GODDESS “ISIS,” or “The Seat.” The hieroglyphic Throne on her head, and followed by the Priestess and Virgins dedicated to her worship. Isis was styled also “ The Beginning,” (as her sister “ Nep- thys ” was "The End") and “Isis, Queen of Egypt,” “ The Goddess nf the Moon,” “ Defender of her Brother,” &c. (The “ Ceres ” of the Greeks.)
The festival, says Heroditus, which they celebrate at Busoris in honor of Isis, is magnificent. After prayers a Bull is sacrificed, which the Priests cut up and afterwards burn, pouring oil on the fire while the victim is consuming. Kneeling and striking themselves in honor of “ Osiris,” they afterwards eat what remains of the sacrifice.
Tamarisk Dancers.
No. 8. THE GOD “ H0RUS,” (or Khons-Horus). — The Apollo of the Greeks. In hieroglyph “ The Warmth of the Sun," “The Path,” (ofthe Sun) “The Support," a “Defender of his Father, &c.” the Son of Osiris and Isis.
He is represented with the single mystic lock of Hair of Childhood slaying his evil Geniuses, under the forms of the Lior, the Gazelle, Scorpions, Vipers, &c.. while Typho, Typhon, Seth or Baal, “The Evil Spirit,” is escaping from beneath his feet in the shape of a Crocodile.
He is attended by his sacred emblems and standards. The Hawk was dedicated to him, the Tamarisk tree, the Testudo (Lyre), &c„, &c.
One of the principal duties of“ Homs,” was that of introducing the souls of the dead into the presence of “ Osiris,” after they had passed the ordeal of final judgment.: he also assisted “Amset” in weighing and ascertaining their good conduct during life, previous to their admission into the august presence of his Father ir. the blessed regions of the Amenti.
Incense Bearers.
NO. 9. THE GODDESS “ NEPTHYS” (“ Proserpine” of the Greeks), called also “ The End,” “ The Sister Goddess,” “The Saviour Sister Goddess,” “The Barren,” “ Rectrix of the Lower Regions.” On her head the hieroglyphic emblem of her name, a bow! and basket, called “ Neb,” placed upon a house, answering to “ Ei ” or " Tci ” —“ Neb-tei ” or “ Neb-thv,” “ The Lady of the Abode.”
“The Sistrum, having the face of Isis on one side, and Nepthys on the other, symbolically represents ‘ the Beginning’ and ‘ the End,’ or ‘ Generation and Corruption,’ ” (Plutarch).
No, 10. THE GODDESS " NEITH,” (the “ Minerva” of the Greeks).
Enthroned, with sceptre, and wearing the “ Teshr." Preceded by Musicians, male and female, Bearers of Incense with green flame, and surrounded by symbolic divinities.
“ Neith” was styled “The Mother Goddess,” or “ Mother of Gods”_______
“ The Deified personification of Air” (Diodorus). She presided over the Upper Hemisphere, and was particularly worshipped at Sais. Stringed Musical Instruments (the Bouni, or Harp of 17 strings, especially) were dedicated to her “Neith” or “Net!),” is the supposed origin of the Greek name, “ Thena ” or “ Athena.”
The belief of the Egyptians in “ the Existence of a Sup; cme Being," is proved by the inscription over the Temple of Minerva (Neith), in hieroglyphic characters, viz.—“I am that which is, which was, and shall be. No Mortal has lifted up my veil—the offspring of my power is the sun ; and the Immortality of the Soul.” By the prayer recited at the time of death, by an Egyptian, expressing his desire to be received into the presence of the deities.
Symbols of Mau and Tefnii, and tEgis or Arnos.
No. 11.	’ ‘ MERSEKAR,” the Snake Goddess, called also “Melsigor” or

Grand Egyptian Spectacle, uMITOCEIS.5î
THE TiSIES, Oct 29th.
The manager of Drury Lane, Mr. E. T. Smith, need not yet despair. By the engagement of Miss Give, Mv. Barry Sulli an, Mr. C. Mathews, and the greatet part of the old Lyceum company, he has brought together a body of histrionic artists such as has vot been seen for years within the walls of Drury .Laiio.
THE ,VtOiVNITTG POST, Oct. 9th.
It must be admitted that the profusion displayed -on “ Nitocris,” which was produced for the first time last evening, has never been exceeded.
I n judging of theatrical pieces, it is always necessary to remember the purpose for which they are brought forward, and us that purpose ,v ,s last night to astonish, by grand scenery and stage co: irivances, if the dialogue was sufficient to carry on the story, and sustain the actions during the intervals, it. i., all that could ht. reasonably required.
...In the banquet scene a ballet was introduced, which was very chararacteristic. and seemed to have' been composed upon the Egyptian forms which w, arc in the habit of seeing in the museums. The attitudes were very well Kept, and the carps de ballet »deserve great praise for ’lie spirited manner in which they danced, and the evident determination they dis-yplayed to sustain the peculiarity of their evolutions.
Ma-,., rtuoi.iW ight; triia vee, ,' ut ■ ■c.talul tl,; tll.c principal dancer, and obtained considerable applause.
The scenery was well painted, particularly the interiors; but that in which the conspirators wcr< drowned was remarkably successful, and was (iie most perfect attempt at introducing water upon the stage which was ever produced : .trio, the groups of dead, j seen through the transport nt. mediums which rose up 1 »through the stage with the electric light upon them, •was admirably effective ; nor do we think that the coronation scene was ever surpassed in the grand display it made of gorgeous and massive objects, when they wen all arranged before the final appearance of the king and queen and the fall of the curtain. Thi writing was- suited to the style of the piece. The music was characteristic.
THE SUN Oct. 9th.
Mr. E. T. Smith, the indefatigable and enter-¡prising less, commenced his ■rgular dramatic season Hast night, and so crowded :.n audience has seldom Jbeen assembled within ¡lie walls ot “ Old Drury ” as .met together last night to greet him, The play I announced for representation was a new original Egyptian, drama, from the pen of FitzbaJH, entitled “Nitocris;” and, for the mysterious placards that ¡have for some time past been posted in the most public places, great curiosity had been excited; and we are bound to say, on the whole, that curiosity lias not been disappointed, for the play in question is one of th e most novel productions that has taken place for years.
THE GLOBE, Oct. 9th.
Mr. E. T. Smith, in organising his forces for i-'winter campaign at Drury Lane, has formed a coalition, comprising several of the specialities of the modern London stage. From the Lyceum he has taken, not only light comedy,but some of its choicest representatives, in the persons of Mr. Charles Mathews, Mr. Roxby, Miss Oliver, and Mrs. Frank Matthews.k His scenic and classical illustrations, as well as his playbills, are upon the Princess’s model. The high tragedy element is represented by Miss ; Glynn. Covent Garden is emulated in respect of stage effects. The ballet, has its upholder in the best, of Englich dancers, Miss Rosina Wright; The1
opening piny w ;s the ‘ Egyptian drama." of which ; we haw so long ir. aid mysuriout. aunour.mnents. : As regard’s the scenery, we can only say that it.| appears quite as accurate and beautiful as any Egyptian illustrations that we have seen. The properties, idols, dec., are" really very splendidly got up , tin. ballei is pretty and characteristic • ana two of the scenes, were admirable pieces of stage effect.
THE Daily NEWS, Oct. 6th.
This theatre opened la.st night for (ho winter si iSon with “ Nitoc.ris 1 a now and original Egyptian play, in live acts, or tableaux, by Mr. Fitzball 'This play it appears has been a long time in preparation , and, having been much »alked of s apiece of a very reman-ble kind, its production excited no ordinary curiosity, and drew an immense audience, the house being densely crowded in every part. As i. scenic spectacle the piece is entitled to the highest praise.
If is not only rich, splendid, and beautiful, hut. must be regarded as a faithful and vivid delineation of “ the land of Egypt " as it existed in the old days of the Pharoahs. The buildings, the decorations of the temples and the palaces, the grim uncouth idols, the arms of the soldiers, the attire of the various classes of men and women—-every object, in short, animate and inanimate, ?s placed before our eyes with a truth
and reality wtifli must tsup 1 > n i!,>. ^nn]’ ;vf i;ri.
weaned researcl and consummate graphic skill. Two scenes in particular—the. banquet, in the grotto of Mcimm. and the concluding scene, of the coronation—have scarcely ever, we believe been exceeded in magnificence. The whole oerformaitce was rc-MOK.NING AtSVEK-TTSER. Oct 8th.
Kitocris, Queen >f Egypt, is a sufficiently doubtful personage to give every latitude to ; dramatist who desires to weave into his play “ startling incidents, emanating from national and ministerial jealousies, love, ambition, and implacable revenge.” Wo dont ¡now that a Shakspeare or a Sophocles could render the human events of a gorgeous spectacle interesting : suffice it, that in the few interstices or pauses, in a succession of scenes, which from their gorgeousness or grandeur, entirely absorb the atten- j tion, some striking situations are elicited, and vehe- ; ment. dialogues drawn out. The long announced spectacle last night overflowed its gorgeousness, its earning, and its wonders on ¡lie stage of Drury Lane, and more than realised all that had been expected of' it. We conscientiously proclaim for “ Nitocris,” , Queen of Egypt, a success monstrous and proportionate to its own vast resources.
THE ERA, Oct Sth
The strength of the piece lies in the spectacular portion of it, and there is a sufficiency of excellence about it to repay by its attraction the vast outlay by which surpassing brilliancy has been achieved. A pretty characteristic ballet, in which Miss Rosina Wright, the first of our English dancers, has a bizarre pas sent, singularly effective in style and clever in 1 execution, may be reserved for special mention as an 1 important element of popularity in the piece. Since the first night some advantageous improvements have taken place, and the lavish applause throughout, and the continuous calls for the manager every evening to respond to a public acknowledgement of his liberality, shows that 1 Nitocris" may be safely admitted into tiic category of successes by which the “Smith” dynasty has been, distinguished.
THE BRITANNIA, Cot 13th.
To all the lovers of the wonderful the proceedings at Drury Lane, on Monday night, must be rife with interest. The Egyptians of the time of Pharoah
lived again ; and, as far as learning and deep resoar» 1» availed, ’hey n surrounded by wonted objects and wonted .scenery. In an original Egyptiai play entitled “ Nitocris,” Mr. Fitzball shewed the London public of 1855 how queens reigned four thousand years ago. So great was the excitement on the opening night that even standing room was J .ardly procurable, and Nitocris in the person of the celebrated Miss Glyn, secured the plaudits »f one of die largest audiences ever assembled within the walls of Drury Lane,

BELL’S LITE IN LONDON, Oct. 14th.
On Monday Mr. E. T. 8mit.li commenced his winior season by producing his wonderful Egyptian play of “ Nitocris,“ which has been mouths in preparation.

Mr. Charles Mathews’ first appearance in Married for Money.
THE TIMES.
Tin; dawn of Drury Lane, which was rendered so cloudy by the. dismal spectacle with which the season commenced, grew-bright yesterday evening through the genial influence of Mr. Charles Mathews, whose cheerful countenance was discovered on the rising of the curtain, and no sooner heboid than recognized with enthusiastic plaudits from every part of a crowded house.
The story of the piece, “ Married for Money,” will »loubt)e*s be remembered. Its moral is directed against marriages between persons of very unequal age, and the person to whom the task of conveying ethical instruction is confided is a young rake of five-and-twenty,who, having married a widow of fifty for the sake of her money, finds himself •• domestic ■slave, despised by even his own servants, till, during the period of a short arrest, he contrives to get drunk in a sponging-house, and, returning home, asserts bis marital supremacy on the strength of the liquor— there was such a charm in the manner in which Mr. Charles Mathews rattled I lie chain of domestic captivity, rendered fearfully tight by the stern reso-!iitton of Mrs. Frank Matthews, that it. was impossible
“ Nitocris ’ is now played at second price. Everything in the way of decoration has been done by the manager, and the procession, in which tin’ Egyptian gods are carried along in a serios almost interminable, is of its kind unique.
WEEKLY DISPATCH.
On Wednesday Mr Smith brought forward the comic part of his company. The house, as on Monday, was crowded in every parr. The novelty was an altered version of the “ Wealthy Widow”— a comedy some twenty years old, which has been compressed and almost re-written for the present occasion. Mr. Mathews received a hearty welcome, the applause was continued for several minutes, and only ceased to be followed by loud laughter when lie commenced tlie piece by pointed allusions to his own situation. He had got into a handsome-house, and had no longer to pay the hills, and he wondered if he should be as much liked as formerly—remarks which were cleverly contrived to serve a double purpose. Mr Mathews appeared before the curtain after each act, and at the conclusion the applause was very- warmly bestowed.
THE DAILY NEWS.
Mr. Charles Mathews made his first, appearance last night, and had such a reception as has seldom been witnessed. The house was so crowded that it was difficult to find even standing room in any part of it. When the curtain, rose Mr. Mathews was ; discovered alone—a perfect storm of applause burst, from all quarters—peal after peal reiterated for j several minutes—and when he began to speak, almost I
every word he uttered was caught up as containing some personal allusion to his own position and circumstances, and drew forth fresh bursts of popular feeling. The piece in which he appeared was a comedy in three acts, called “ Married for Money.” The whole piece is exceedingly good; the plot is well constructed and clear, the dialogue is lively and pointed, and many of the situations are mirth-provoking in the. extreme. The acting was capital—every part had a fitting representative. In the character of Mr, Mopus, Mathews was entirely in his element; his picture of the. henpecked husband wincing under a train of unceasing mortifications, while, his constitutional gaiety of temper finds vent, in rueful jests on his own unhappy plight, was from beginning to end a piece of exquisite comedy.
MORNING CHRONICLE.
The prodigal son of the London theatres, Charles Mathews, lias returned from his wanderings in distant parts. We have no reason to suppose that they have proved so very disagreeable, but we are sure that the manner in which he was taken, so to speak, to lhe hearts his old friends and admirers, last evening, must have been one. of the most agreeable incidents of hi.- life. Notwithstanding his irregular ovation on Monday evening, the freshness el bis presence did not seem a bit diminished, anil be was received with nil enthusiasm equal to hi-deserts. For, after all, there is no denying that in his line he has at present no equal on ttie Emilish stage ; and that that line, though perhaps not lying amongst the snowy pinks of the very highest ridges of art, does carry us through those humbler, but less frigid districts, where we all find ours- Ives more at home and much better amused. Therefore, arc wp heartily glad to see Charles Mathews amongst us again. Charles Mathews’s Mopus is amongst his best parts ; nothing e.an be more amusing, and at the »ante time more true, than his picture of the “cowed ’ suljcetion of Mopus—-his nervous dread of offending his wife—the constraint of his manner with his old friends-—his obvious perception of his own degradation — his consequent self-contempt — and the violence of bis manner, and his exaggerated demonstrations of authority in the hist scene, are not less eminently characteristic of the progress from slavery to tyranny. Wo feel at every step he takes that he is aghast at his own boldness. Charles Mathews never played with more verve and spirit than last night, nor with more success, for, besides his reception, he was recalled at the dose of each act..
HORNING ADVERTISER.
The announcement of Mr. Charles Mathews’s appearance at this house in a three-act comedy,
assisted by some of the more prominent members of ihe Lyceum company, who have faithfully followed the fortunes of tlieir leader, attracted an enthusiastic) and overflowing house. “ Married for Money,’’ the new piece, is a modern adaptation of an older play, “The. Wealthy Widow;” and when the curtain drew up upon Mr.Mopus in a drawing-room, which showed that the taste and elegance of the Lyceum hud been transplanted to “Old Drury,” the warm and protracted welcome of the audience to their old favorite was such as is rarely witnessed. The other Lyceum favorites, Mr. Roxby, Mrs. Frank Matthews. Miss M. Oliver, and Miss Mason, experienced an equally warm reception in their respective, degrees ; and this tumultuous ovation over, the house settled down to the comedy. Its structure, plot, and incidents, aie exceedingly simple, and admirably adapted t display the peculiar characteristics of the actors engaged i.i d THE ERA,.
On Wednesday evening, to a house crammed, if possible, more compactly than on the opening night, Mr, Charles Mathews made his debut under the present management. And such a debut! IS sooner had the overture, teased than the curtain went suddenly up, and discovered tin popular comedian alone on the stage, seated across a reversed chair, on the top of which hi« folded arms rested, and whence he looked upon a wide sea ol' heads, over which hats and handkerchiefs rolled and rippled in turbulent commotion like that sea tossed into foam. No sooner has he become, thus apparent than «n absolute bombardment of applause is directed against him. He rises, bows, sits, rises again, becomes reseated, and the complimentary bombardment is renewed with increased vigour. The very t <l.uur on which he sits stems to vibrate» with die intensity ot the hearty greeting, and to be getting up some r cognition of its cwn. He recovers once more k upright position, renews his bowing, resumes hi., seat, and then, on bis first ejaculation, off goes the whole house again in a burst of irrepressible enthusiasm, and the Laaugurative syllable, “ ah 1 is isolated from the context. At last, and apparently from sheer physical exhaustion ol the auuieu»-e, a hearing is obtained. His first remark is, “Ah ! here I am again!" and the public voice gathering a tics'll accession of power from the lapse of its exercise, records its appreciation of that circumstance in another burst of sonorous enthusiasm. “t*>v -n up my own establishment,” elicits another recognitio “ (Jot a large house over my head—wonder how I shall like it!” is accepted as another pr -vocative of a response, and finally the congratulatory tone in which the words, “I shall not have to p \ any -■ the bills, though,” is delivered, brings down a terrific outburst of recognition.

Hn. 1. THE ARK OR “ SARIME OF KNOHMIS." (Called also “Known,” “Neph," or “Rum,” i.c. “ Water.”) Tbr primary form of “Ammo n,” and styled “ I he Leader of Gods”-—“The Creating Intelligence”—“ The Spirit of God"—“ Thc Spirit of the (Vernal) Deity”—“The Soul of the Sun”—and, by the Greeks,
“ Jupiter Chnumis.”
“Worshipped by thc inhabitants of rhebai.s ” (Plutarch).
The Asp was sacred to this God.
The Ark, (bearing his hieroglyph, with that of the Beetle or “ Creative power,”) i- also decorated with this emblem.
Symbolic standard of “Athor” j Symbolic standard of ditto. (Venus), the oracle of Night | oi Darkness (? chaos), “from wb.ence arose all created things” !
(Egyptian belief).
THE SYBIL bearing the emblematic rush wand, with “ Ileka,” “The Frog” (the son of “ Num”), and type of the first state of man.
Ho. 2. “MA,” “ MEII,” or “ THMEI.” Or “Truth,” “ the Blind Goddess,” represented with her eyes closed, or blinded.
The Pries,s bearing this Goddess have- libation buckets and simpula
“THMEI,” or TRUTH or JUSTICE. This deity had also a twofold character, as Goddess of Truth and Justice. A small image of this God was worn by the Chief Judge while engaged in listening to cases brought before him.
A similar emblem was worn by the High Priests of thc. Jews, and it is remarkable that the word “ Thummim” is not only translated “Truth;” but, being a plural or dual word, corresponds to thc Egyptian word of “ Two Truths”•—i.e. “ Light and Truth.” Breastplates having the figures of the two Gods “Re ’ (Light) and “ Thmei” (Truth) represented upon them have been discovered.
Priests with £ araba.i.
The Searabeus may be considered as an emblem of “The Sun” —of “ The Creative power”—and of the God “Pthah" (Vulcan).
TffCENSE Bearer.
Waving his incense patera before the God. The incense was in the shape of a small globe or pill ; and, upon modern analysis, is found to consist of aromatic substances with gum, and gave out colored light or flame when thrown into thc burnning cup.
Mo. 3. “APIS." His titles in hieroglyphs were “ The Sacred Bull of Memphis,” “ The Bull of Abundance, adored by the People, ’
‘ The Sacred Bull of Pthah,” “Guardian of the Solar Year,”
“ Apis renowned over the World,” “ The Symbol of Inundation.”
Richly draped and on a car led by Priests bearing the emblems of “ Serapis,” or “Sari Api," “The Pillar of Mensuration”—“Column of Measurement,” or “ Milometer,” of wood divided into cubits.
Attendant Priests a'so fan the Idol and offer homage as it passes forward.
The festivals in honor of Apis lasted 7 days, on which occasion a large concourse of people assembled at Memphis—the Priests led the Sacred j (living) Bull in solemn procession, every one coming forward from their j houses to welcome him.
Pliny and Solin,.- affirm that children who smelt Ivis breath were thought thereby gifted with thc power of predicting future events.
The tokens which distinguished this sacred Bull at its birth were a white spot resembling a crescent on its right side, and a lump under its tongue in the form of a Beetle—as pretended by the Priests. The people believe him to be the cause of the swelling and inundation of the Nile, which produced fertility and abundance, and celebrated his festival at about the period of this annual occurrence with every demonstration of rejoicing and litoral abandonment to the intoxication of joy all over the kingdom.
Many temples were erected and dedicated to “Apis,” and one also to “ Serapis,” the Divinity of the Column of Measurement—the Kilometer !
\.R,—The decorations of the drapery upon the Bull and Carriage are principally composed of the first flowers that spring from thc earth after the recession of the flood, i.e. the Lotus and Meliolotus.
Priests with the “pretended” God “ Canopus,” ok Water ofj bring to the God of the Nhle.
“ it is said, that the Chaldeans, transporting the fire, which was their (iod, into all the provinces, offered to let him combta with those of other nations, on condition that if he remained the conqueror, they should adore him. The Priests of Canopus accepted the challenge and devised this stratagem. They fabricate in Egypt pitchers of an extremely porous earth, through which the water filtrates and is purified. The Arch-priest took one of them, stopped thc pores with wax and painting it of various colors, filled it with water and made i his God He covered it with the head of an ancient statue, said to be that of the pilot Menelaus. The Chaldeans presented themselves; the contest began, they lighted their lire around the vase; the wax melts, the water runs through the pores and extinguishes the fire. The fraud of the Priest gave the victory to Canopus over the Chaldean deity. From that moment his image Las been represented with very short lect, a narrow neck, and the belly and back rounded like a pitcher.
It is under this form that ho is worshipped as the vanquisher of all the Gods.”—Rvffiii Uistuire de t'Egtise, Urresccand.
No. 4. THE GODDESS''PASH-T,” ■ The Memphian Lioness.” -‘The beloved of Pthah,' “The Goddess of Eire,” “ Bubastes ” (the Diana of the Greeks), preceded by sacred dancers. The Idol carried by Priests in their Leopard-skin dresses, with red incense flaming before her, and surrounded by “Symbolic Divinities,” “Winged Geniuses,” Ac.
One of the principal festivals held in Egypt was at Bubastis in honor of Pasht—700,000 persons of both sexes being present.. \ great number of victims were sacrificed, wine was profusely drank, dancing of the wildest character went forward, men played flutes, women sang and shrieked as loud as possible, struck the “ Crotola ” (Symbals) or Clappers of wood and metal, &c.
Lottj* Dancers (females).
Incense Bearers.
No. 5. THE GOD “OSIRIS,” as “Osiris Petheaipamentes ’ (the Pluto of the Greeks), “He who is Resident in the Hades,” “President of the Amend," “ Receiver and Giver,” “ The Sun,” “ The Jv of the World,” “ The source of the Nile ' “ He who ha.-- many Eyes,” a form of Ammon, wearing the Atf,” and having the Crook and flagellum. Regarded as “ The author of time,” from the words “ Osch-Iri,” “ The maker of time.”
The principal office of this Deity was to Judge th • Dead, and to rule over that kinedom where the souls ol good men wen admitted to eternal felicity.	_	^
This Deity was very famous, his Temples and Presto were to be found in almost every part of Egypt, the sacred rites of Osiris vere a profound mystci > , never revealed. His name even avoided, as of too august a nature to be mentioned.
The “Ivy,” with which the Priests decorated themselves was sacred to him, and also the “ Meliolotus.”
No. (>. THE SACRED BOAT OF THE ATJENTI. or Lower Regions,
with the Four Genii, or Demi-G >cls (bearing emblems of Life and Power) and their vases of “Amenti,” or tl at subterraneous region where they (the Egyptians) imagined the souls of the dead to go after their decease.

The 4th is “ Kabh-senuf,” “ Refresher of his Brethren.” (Hawk-headed.)
The Sepulchral Vases have heads in shape of the Pottr Genii oi the Dead, and each was employed for holding a portion of thc Vis ra 0f the deceased, embalmed separately and deposited in them. On thc “ Amset ” Vase is inscribed the speech of “Isis to the dead ; or that of “Kepi” is a similar speech from “ Ncpt.liys ; ' on that of “Tuautmutf,” one from “ Keith ; ” and on that of “ Kabh-sennt ’ one from ,Selk.” Thc purport of each being an Assurance of Protection, and of being “near thee ” “ beside thee,” or “ I come to be beside thee.”
The Sacred Boat is followed by the symbolic 1 Eyes of Osiris,” or, of “ The Sun,” emblems of the all-seeing presence of the Divh ity. jT Note.—Beside the Four Ymenti, there were -If Assessors or Judges of the Forty-two Crimes, from which a good man shouu be free, and these also differ from the 3(> Demons mentioned by Origen, that presided over thc human body and were invoked to cure the infirmiU's of the peculiar member immediately under their piotection.
No. 7. THE GODDESS xSIS, or The Sett.” The hieroglyphic Throne on her head, and followed by tin Priestess and Vi'rgins dedicated to her worship.

He is attenui d by his sacred emblems and standards. The Hawk was dedicated to him, tiie Tamarisk tree, thc Testudo (Lyre), &c., &c.
One of the principal duties of“ Horns,” was that of introducing the souls of the dead into the presence of “ Osiris,” after the} had passed the ordeal of final judgment; he also assisted “Amset” in weighing and ascertaining their good conduct during life, previous to tlicir admission into the august presence of his Father in the blessed regions of the Amenti.

THE GODDESS “ NEPTHYS” (“ Proserpine" of the Greeks), called also ‘ The End," “ The Sister Goddes-;,” “Thc Saviour Sister Goddess,” “The Barren,” “ Rectrix of the Lower Regions.” On her head the hieroglyphic emblem of her name, a bowl and basket, called “ Neb,” placed upon a house, answering to “ Ei ” or “ Tei ” —“ Neb-tei” or “ Neb-thy,” “The Lady of the Abode.”

The belief of th: Egyptians in " the Existence of a Supreme Being," ¡s proved by the inscription over the Temple of Minerva (Keith), in hioro-dyphic characters, viz.—“I am that whi-h is. which was, and shall lie. No Mortal has lifted up my veil—the offspring of my power is the sun ; and the Immortality of the Sold.” By the prayer recited at I he time of death.

ON THE
G-rand Egyptian Spectacle, “NIT GOBI S„”
THE t;MES, Oet Z9th.
The manager of Drury I.one, Mr. E. T. Smith, need not yet despair. By the engagement of Miss Glyn, Mr. Barry Sullivan, Mr. C. Mathews, and the greater part, of the old Lyceum company, he has brought together a body of histrionic artists such as has not been seen for years within tin- walls of Drury Lane.
THE FORKING TOST, Oet. 3th.
It mns“ be admitted that the prolusion displayed on “Nitocris,’ which was produced for the j first time last evening, ha:-, never been exceeded. In judging of theatr ical pieces, it is always necessary to remember the purpose for which they are brought forward, and as that purpose was last night to astonish, by grand scenery and stage contrivances, if the dialogue was sufficient to carry on the story, and sustain the actions during the intervals, it is alt that could be reasonably required.
In the banquet, scene a ballet was introduced, which was very ebararacteristic, and seemed to have been composed upon the Egyptian forms which we are in the habit of seeing in the museums. The attitudes were very well kept, and the corps ds battel i deserve great praise for the spirited manner in which they danced, and the evident determination they displayed to sustain the peculiarity of their evolutions. ML- ROsina Wright was very successful ns thc principal dancer, and obtained considerable applause.
The scenery was well painted, particularly the interiors : but that in which the conspirators were drowned was remarkably successful, and was tie most perfect attempt at introducing water upon the stage which was ever produced ; and the groups of dead, seen through the transparent mediums which rose up. through the stage with thc electric light upon tuem. ■was admirably effective; nor do we think that the coronation scene was ever surpassed in tine grand [ display it made of gorgeous and massive object -\ when ♦Uv.'l - were disarranged before the final at>Roai anre of the king and queen and the fall of the curtain The writing was suited to the style of the piece, The music was characteristic.
the suiy Oct. 9th.
Mr. E. T. Smith, thc indefatigable and enterprising less, commenced ids regular dramatic season last night, and so crowded an audience has .-eiuom been assembled withii the walls of“ Old Dru-y ’’ as met together last night to greet him. Tie play I announced for representation was a new »riginal Egyptian drama, from the pen of Fitzball, entitled “Nitocris;” and, for the mysterious placaids that have for some time past been posted in th» most public places, great curiosity had been excited , and we are bound to say, on the whole, that curiosity has not been disappointed, for the play in question is on? of the most novel productions that has taken place for years.
THE QX.0BE, Oct. 9th.
Mr. E T. Smith, in organising his forces for a winter campaign at Drury Lane, has formed a coalition, comprising several of the specialities of the modern London stage. From the Lyceum he lias taken, not only light, comedy, but some of its choicest representatives, in the persons of Mr. Charles Mathews, Mr. Roxbv, Miss Oliver, and Mrs. Frank Matthews. His scenic and classical illustrations, as well ¡c his playbills, are upon '.he Princess's model. The high tragedy element is represented by Miss Glynn. Covent Garden is emulated in respect of stage effects. The ballet has its upholder in the best of Englich dancers, Miss Rorina Wright; The
opening play was the “ Egyptian drama,” of which we have so Jong heard mysterious announcement*. As regards the scenery, we can only say that it appears quite as accurate and beautiful as any Egyptian illustrations that we have seen. The | properties, idols, Ac., are really very splendidly got up ; the ballet is pretty and characteristic ; and two of thc scenes, were admirable pieces of stage effect.
THE DAILY STEWS, Oct. 8tit.
This theatre opened last nigh' for the winter s ason with ‘ Nitocrii',1’ a new and original Egyptian play, in five acts, or tableaux, by Mr. Fffzball. This play it appears has been a long time in preparation ; and, having been min Ii talked of as a piece of a very reinarable kind, its production excited no ordinary curiosity, and drew an immense audience, the house being densely crowded in every part. As a scenic spectacle the piece is entitled to the highest praise, it i> no onlj rich, splendid, and beautiful, but must be regarded as a faithful and vivid delineation of “ the land of Egypt ” as if existed in the old days of the Pham;;¡is The. buildings, the decorations of the temples and th" palaces, the grim uncouth idols, the arms of the soldiers, the attire of the various classes of men and women—every object, in short, animate amt inanimate, is placed before our eyes with a truth and reality which must have been thc result of unwearied research and consummate graphic skill. Two scenes in particular—the banquet in the grotto of M< mon, and the concluding scene of the coronation—have scarcely ever, we belies >• been exceeded in magnificence. The whole performance was re-'«rORNII^G ADVERTISES.. Oct bth.
Nitocris Queen of Egypt, is a sufficiently doubtful personage to give every latitude to a dramatist who desires to weave into his -day “ startling incidents, emanating from national and ministerial jealousies, love, ambition, and implacable revenge.” We dont know that a Sbakspeare or a Sophocles could render the human events of a gorgeous spectacle interesting; suffice it, that in the few interstices or pauses, in a succession of scenes, which from their gorgeousness or grandeur, entirely absorb the attention, some striking situations are elicited, and vehement. dialogues drawn out. The long announced spectacle last night overflowed its gorgeousnes-s, its earning, and its wonders on the stage of Drury Lane, r.ntl more than realised all that bi d been expected of it. IVi conscientiously proclaim for “ Nitocris,” Queen of Egy pi, a success monstrous and proportionate to its own vast resources.
THE ERA, Oet Sth
The strength of the piece lies in the spectacular portion of it, and there is a sufficiency of excellence about it to repay by its attraction the vast outlay by which surpassing brilliancy has been achieved. A pretty characteristi'. ballet, in which Miss Rosina Wright, the first of our English dancers, lias a bizarre pas- $eul, singularly effective, in style and clever in execution, may be reserved for special mention as an important element of popularity ill the piece. Since the first night some advantageous improvements have taken place, and the lavish applause throughout., and thc continuous calls for the manager every evening to respond to a public acknowledgement of his liberality, shows that “Nitocris” maybe safely admitted into the category of successes by which the “Smith” dynasty has been distinguished.
THE BRITAN MIA. Cc. i 3th.
To all the lovers of the wonderful the proceedings at Drury Lane, on Monday night, must be rife with interest. The Egyptians of the tii . of Pharoah
lived again , and, as far as learning and deep -earch availed, they were surrounded by wonted objects and wonted scenery, Jn an original Egyptian play entitled “ Nitocris,” Mr. Fitzball showed the London public of 1855 how queens reigned four thousand years ago. So great was the excitement on thi opening night that even standing room was hardly procurable, and Nitoeris in the person of the cele brated Mils Glyn, secured the plaudits cf one of the large st audiences ever assembled within tbe walls o, Drurv Lane.
THE MORNING HERALD Oct. &th.
-Strong opportunity for display is afforded by a libretto of this description, and much has been done by the manager to produce a glowing series o. tableaux illustrative of Egypt and Egyptian life. The locality is far from new as regards pic tori.a1 delineation ; for the massive temples of Pharoah hav long been used up by the scene-painters. Th learned “ Dykwynkin,” to whom M>- Smith ha assigned the task of superintendence, and who»* research in ascertaining the precise characteristics o Egyptian architecture and worship he announces will grandiloquent emphasis, has laboured diligently : and the accessories of the piece are not ouly multitudinous,

THE WrOSmiNi* CHRONICLE, Oct. 9th,
After eighteen months of preparation the grand Egyptian drama was produced last evening at tho opening of this theatre for this season, with a pomp and display of scenery rivalling the celebrated production of “ Sardanapaius ” at the Royal Princess’s Theatre. Indeed, in one point, but that a very important one, Drury-lane Theatre has rather the advantage of its rival
THE WITIUV DISPATCH-, Oct. 14th.
Enormous afiches and innumerable advertisements in the. papers have for months informed us of the intended productiou ol an Egyptian spectacle, by Mr. Fitzball. called “ Nitocris." in which much expense was to be incurred and much learned research engaged to revive in exact imitation, the gigantic monuments of Egyptian splendour, and the curious symbols of Egyptian superstition The sc-'nery is admirable: the coronation scene is extraordinarily effective, occupying as it does the whole depth of the stage, which is completely covered with oilcloth.
BELL E RIFE IN LONDON, Oct. l*th.
On Monday Mr. E, T. ¡Smith commenced his winter season by producing his wonderful Egyptian play of “ Nitocris,” which has been months in preparation. The scenery was well painted, particularly ihe interiors, but that in which the conspirators were drowned was remarkably successful, and was tbe most perfect attempt at introducing water upon the stage which was ever produced, and the groups of dead, seen through the transparent, mediums which rose up through the stage with the, new electric light upon them, was admirably effective; nor do we think that the, coronation scene was ever surpassed; ■. the grand display it made of gorgeous and massif' oVypets, when they were aJJ. arranged before the final appearance, of the king and queen and the fall of tbe curtain.
THE WEEKLY TIMES, Oct. l*tb,
“ Nitocris, Queen of Egypt,” the grand pageant so universally announced, and so long expected, was produced at (his theatre on Monday last, with an amount, of splendour and archaelogical labour which finds no parallel in the history of spectacle. The lessee deserves the thanks and aid of the public lor his enterprising spirit.

THE TIMES.
Tut; dawn of Drury Lane, which was rendered so cloudy by die dismal spectacle with which tbe season commenced, grew bright y esterday evening through thc genial influence of Mr. Charles Mathews, whose cheerful countenance was discovered on the ¡'smg of the curtain, and no sooner beheld than recognized with enthusiastic plaudits from every part of a crowded house.
The story of the piece, “ Married for Money,” will doubtless be. remembered, its moral is directed against marriages between persons of very unequal age, and the person to whom the task of conveying ethical instruction is confided is a young rakt of five-and-twenty,who, having married a widow of fifty for the sake, uf her money, finds himself a domestic slave, despised by even his own servants, till,during the period of a short arrest, he contrives to get drunk in a sponging-house, and, returning home, asserts his marital supremacy on the strength of the liquor— there was such a charm in the manner in which Mr. Charles Mathews rattled the chain of domestic captivity, rendered fearfully tight by the stern resolution of Mrs. Frank Matthews, that it was impossible
“ Nitocris’' is now played at second price. Everything in the way of decoration has been done by the manager, and the procession, in which the Egyptian gods are carried along in a series almost interminable, is of its kind unique.
WEEKLY UjSFATCH.
On Wednesday Mr. Smith brought forward the comic part of his company. The house, as on Monday, was crowded in every part. The novelty was an altered version of the “ Wealthy Widow”— a comedy some twenty years old, which has been compressed and almost, re-written for the present occasion. Mr. Mathews received a hearty welcome, the applause was continued for several minutes, and only ceased to be followed by ioud laughter when he commenced the piece by pointed allusions to his own situation. He had got into a handsome house, and had no longer to pay the hills, and he wondered if he should be as much liked as formerly— remarks which were cleverly contrived to serve a double purpose. Mr Mathews appeared before the curtain after each act,and at the conclusion the applause was very warmly bestowed.
THE DAILY NEWS.
Mr. Charles Mathews made his first appearance last night, and had such a reception as has seldom been witnessed The house was so crowded that it was difficult to find even standing room in any part of it. When the curtain rose Mr. Mathews was discovered alone—a perfect storm of applause burst! from all quarters—peal after peal reiterated for ! several minutes—and when he began to speak, almost l
¡every word he uttered was caught up as containing some personal allusion to his own position and circumstances, and drew forth fresh bursts of popular feefing. The piece in which he appeared was a comedy in three acts, called “ Married for Money.” The whole piece is exceedingly good; the plot is well constructed and clear, the dialogue is lively and pointed, and many of thc situations are mirth-provoking in the extreme. The acting was capital—every part had 11 fitting representative. In the character of Mr. Mopus, Mathews was entirely in his element; his picture of the henpecked husband wincing under a train of unceasing mortifications, while his constitutional gaiety of ttniper finds vent in rueful jests on his own unhappy plight, was from beginning to end a piece, of exquisite comedy.
MORNIiTG CHRONICLE.
The prodigal son of tin London theatres, Charles Mathews, lias returned from his wanderings in distant parts. Wo have no reason to suppose that they have proved so very disc pace able, but we are sure that the manner in which he teas taken, so to speak, to the hearts of his old friends and admirers, last evening, must have been one of tbe most agreeable incidents of Ins life Notwithstanding his irregular ovation on Monday evening, the freshness of his presence did not seem a hit diminished, and he was received with an enthusiasm equal to his deserts. For, after all, there, is no denying that in his line be has at present no equal on the English j stage ; and that that line, though perhaps m.t lying amongst 'he snowy p aka of the vety highest ridges ol art, does carry us through those humbler, but less frigid districts, where we all find ourselves more at home and much better amused. Therefore, are we heartily glad to see Charles Mathews amongst us again. Charles Mathews’s Mopus js amongst it is best parts ; nothing can be more amusing, and at the same time more true, than his picture of The 1“cowed ” subjection of Mopus—his nervous dread of offending his wife—the constraint of his manner i with his old friends—his obvious perception of his own degradation — his consequent self-contempt | — and the violence of his manner, and his exaggerated demonstrations of authority in the - last scene, arc not less eminently characteristic 'of the progress from slavery to tyranny. We feel at every step he takes that be is atrhast at his own boldness. Charles Mathews never played with more terra and spirit than last night, nor with more success,for, besides his reception, lie was recalled at the close of each act.
MORNING ADVERTISER.
The announcement of Mi Charles Mathews’s appearance at this house in a three-act comedy,
assisted by some of the more prominent members of ihe Lyceum company, who have faithful!}' followed the fortunes of their leader, attracted an enthusiastic and overflowing house. “Married for Money,” the new piece, is a modern adaptation of an older play, “ The Wealthy Widow;’’ and when the curtain drew up upon Mr.Mopus in a drawing-room, which showed that the taste and elegance of the Lyceum had been transplanted to “Old Drury,” tine warm and protracted welcome of the audience to their old favorite was such as is rarely witnessed. The other Lyceum favorites, Mr. Roxby, Mrs. Frank Matthews, Miss M. Oliver, and Miss Mason, experienced an equally warm reception in their respective degrees ; and this tumultuous ovation over, the house settled down to the comedy. Its structure, plot, and incidents, are exceedingly simple, and admirably adapted to display the peculiar characteristics of the actors engaged in it.
THE ERA.
On Wednesday evening, to a house crammed, if possible, more compactly than on the opening night, Mr. Hi aides Mathews made his debut under the present management. And such a dehut! No sooner had the overture ceased than thc curtain went suddenly up, and discovered the popular comedian alone on the stage, seated across a reversed chair, on the top of which his folded arms rested, and whence he looked upon a wide sea of heads, over which hats and handkerchiefs rolled and rippled in turbulent commotion like that sea tossed into team. No sooner has he become thus apparent than an absolute bombardment of applause is directed against him. He rises, hows, sits, rises again, becomes reseated, and the complimentary bombardment is renewed with increased vigour. The very chair on which lie sits seems to vibrate with the intensity of the hearty greeting, and to be getting up some recognition of its own. He recovers once more his upright position, renews his bowing, resumes his seat, and then, on his first ejaculation, off goes the whole house again in a burst of irrepressible enthusiasm, and Hie inaugurative syllable, “ah'" is isolated from tbe context, At last, and apparently from sheer physical exhaustion of the audience, a hearing is obtained. His first remark is,“ Ah ! here 1 am again!” and the public voice gathering a fresh accession of power from the lapse of its exercise, records its appreciation of that circumstance in another burst of sonorous enthusiasm. “Given up my own establishment,” elicits another recognition. “ Got a large house over my head—wonder liow I shall like it!” is accepted as another provocative of a response, and finally the congratulatory tone in which the words, “ I shall not have to pay any rf the hills, though,” is delivered, brings down a terrific outburst of recognition.

The principal office of this Deity was to Judge the Dead, and to rule over that kingdom where the souls of good meu wen admitted to eternal felicity.
This Deity was very tamous—his Temples and Priests were to be found in almost every part of Egypt; the sacred rites of Osiris were a profound mystery, never revealed. His name even avoided, as of too august a nature ito be mentioned.

Pliny and flollnus affirm that children who smelt his breath were thought thereby gifted with the power of predicting future events.
The tokens which distinguished this Sacred Bull at its birth were a while spot resembling a erowoeiHt>n it* right side, and a lump under its fcwguc 1“ 11,0 form of a beetle—-as pretended by the priests. The people baffcivcd him to he the cause of tho swelling and in inflation ot the Nile, whleb produced fertility and abundance, and celcb-ated his festival at about tie period of this annual occurrence, with every demonstration of rejoicing and literal abandonment to the intoxication of Jvy all over the

Two Functionaries with Emblems of" Power” and “ Stability.”
1C
Th
primary —“ The
Creative Intelligence”—‘‘The Spirit of God"—“ The Spirit of the (Vernal) Deity"—‘‘The Soul of the Sun"—and, hy the Greeks,
Ho. L THE ARK OR .“.’SARIHE OF KNOUMIS."
“ Knoum,’’ “Nepb,” or “Num,” e.i, "Water.”) The form of “ Ammon,” and styled *' The Leader of Gods
.	.	. iof
•‘ Jupiter Chnumis.”
« Worshipped by the inhabitants of Thebais” (Pin arch).
The Asp was sacred to this God.
The Ark, (hearing his hieroglyph, with that of the Beetle or “Creative power,") is decorated with this emblem.
Symbolic standard of “ Athor”	Symbolic standard of ditto.
(Venus), the oracle of Night or Darknes (? chaos), “fiom whence arose all created things"
(Egyptian belief).	,
THE SYBIL, bearing the emblematic rush wand, with “ Heka,” “ The Fryg" (the son of« Num”), and type of the first state of man.
H«. 2, “HA," “ TO,” or “THMEI,” or « Truth,” «the Blind Goddess," Goddess,” represented with her eyes closed, or blinded.
The Priests bearing this Goddess have libation buckets and simpula.
“ THMEI,” or TRUTH or JUSTICE. This deity had also a twofold character, as Goddess of Truth and Justice. A small image of this God was Worn by the Chief Judge while engaged in listening to cases bronght before him.
A similar emblem was worn by the High Priests of the Jews, and it is remarkable that tha word “ Thummim” is not only translated “ Truthbut being a plural or dual word, corresponds to the Egyptian word of “ Two
Truths”__i. e. “ Light and Truth." Breastplates having the figures of the
two Gods “ Re,” (Light) and “Thmei,” (Truth) represented upon them have been discovered.
Priests with Scarab.*i,
The Scarabeus may be considered as an emblem of “ The Sun”—of “ The Creative power,”—and of the God “ Pthah," (Vulcan).
Incense Bearer,
Waving his incense patera before the God. The incense was in the shape of a small globe or pill; and, upon modern analysis, was found to consist of aromatic substances with gum, and gave out colored light or flame when thrown into the burning cop.
It, 9, “APIS." His titles in hieroglyphs were “ The Sacred Bull of Memphis,” " The Bull of Abundance, adored by the People,” " The Sacred Bull of Pthah," “ Guardian of the Solar Year," ‘‘ Apia renowned over the World," “The Symbol of Inundation."
Richly draped, and on a car led by Priests bearing the emblems of "Serapis,” or “Sari Api,” “The Pillar of Mensuration"—“Column of Measurement," or “ Nilometer," of wood divided into cubits.
Attendant Priests also fan the Idol, and offer homage as it passes forward.
The festivals in honor of Apis lasted 7 days, on whieh occasion a large concourse of people assembled at Memphis—the Priests led the Sacred (living) Boll in solemn procession, every one coming forward from their houses to welcome him.
Pliny and 8olinus affirm that children who smelt his breath were thought thereby gifted with the power of predicting future events.
The tokens which distinguished this sacred Bull at his birth were a white spot resembling a crescent on its right side, and a lump under its tongue in the form of a Beetle—as pretended by the Priests. The people believe him to be the cause of the swelling and inundation of the Nile, which produced fertility and abundance, and celebrated his festival at about the period of this annual occurrence, with every demonstration of rejoicing and literal abandonment to the intoxication of jov all over the kingdom.
N.B.—The decorations of the drapery upon the Bui! and carriage are rineipally composed of the first flowers that spring from the earth after the peceseion of the flood, «.«. the Lotus and Meliolotns.
Putters with tn* “pretended” God “Canofue," or Watxr offekinu «v the God or the Nils.	*
■ It ia said, that the Chaldeans, transporting the fire, which was their God, into all the province«, offered to let him combat with those of other nations, on condition that if he remained the conqueror they shonld adore him. The Priests of Canopus accepted the challenge, and devised this stratagem ;—They fabricate in Egypt pitchers of an extremely porous earth, through which the water filtrates and is purified. The Arch-Priest took one of them, stopped the pores with wax, and painting it of various colors, filled St with water, and made it his God. He covered it with the head of an ancient statne, said to be that of the pilot Menelaus, The Chaldeans presented themselves; the contest began, they lighted their fire around the vase, the wax melts, the water runs through the pores and extinguishes the fire; the fraud of the Priest gave the victory to Canopus over the Chaldean deity. From that moment his image has been represented with very short fret, a narrow neck, and the belly and back rounded like a pitcher. It in under this form that he ia worshipped as the vanquisher of all the Gods.”-— Ruffin ffistoire de t’Eglise, Here second.
Ho. 4. THE GODDESS “PASH-T.” “The Memphian Lioness," ‘‘The beloved of Pthah,” “TheGoddess of Fire,” ‘ Bubaates,” (theDiana of the Greeks), preceded by sacred dancers. The Idol, carried by Priests in their leopard-skin dresses, with red incense flaming before her, and .surrounded by “Symbolic Divinities,” “Winged Geniuses.” dec.
One of the principal festivals held in Egypt was at Bubastes, in honor of Pash-t—700,000 persons of both sexes being present. A great number of victims were sacrificed, wine was profusely drank, dancing of the wildest character went forward, men played flutes, women sang and shrieked as lond as possible, struck the“Crotola" (Cymbals) or Clappers of wood and metal,
Lotus Dancers (female >
Incense Bearers.
Ho. 5. THE GOD “ OSIRIS. as “Osiris Petbempamentes” (the Pluto of the Greeks), “ He who is Resident in the Hades,” “ President of the Amenti," “ Receiver and Giver,” “ The Sun," “ The Eye of the World,” “The Source of the Nile,” “He who has many Eyes,” a form of Ammon, wearing the “ Atf," and having the Crook and flagellum. Regarded as “ The author of time," from the words “ Osch-lri,” “ The maker of time."
The principal office of this Deity was to Judge the Dead, and to lule over that kingdom where the souls of good men were admitted to eternal
Deity was very famous, his Temples and Priests were to be found in almost every part of Egypt, the sacred rite» of Osiris were a profound mystery, never revealed His name even avoided, a* of too august a nature to be mentioned.
The “Ivy," with which the Priests decorated themselves, was sacred to him, and also the “ Meliolotus."
Ho. 6. THE BACKED BOAT 07 THE AXEHTI, or Lower Regions,
with the Four Genii, or Demi-Gods (bearing emblems of Life and Power) and their vases of “ Amenti," or that subterraneous region where they (the Egyptians) imagined the souls of the dead to go after their decease.
The 1st genius is “ Amset,” “ Judge of the Amenti.” (Human headed.)
The 2nd is “ Hepi,” “ Concea’ed Number.” (Baboon-headed.)
The 3rd is “ Tuautmutf,” “ Adorer of his Mother." (Jackall-headed.)
The 4th is “ Kabh-senuf," “ Refresher of his Brethren.” (Hawk-headed.)
The Sepulchral Vases have heads in shape of the Four Genii of the Dead, and each was employed for holding a portion of the Visera of the deceased, embalmed separately and deposited in them. On the “ Ainset" Vase is inscribed the speech of “ Isis” to the dead ; on that of “ Hepi" is a similar speech from “ Nepthys;" on that of “ Tuautmutf,” one from “ Neith and on that of “ Kabh-senuff,” one from “Selk." The purport of each being an Assurance of Protection, and of being “ near thee,” “ beside thee," or “ I come to be beside thee.”
The Sacred Boat is followed by the symbolic “ Eyes of Osiris,” or, of “ The Sun,” emblems of the all-seeing presence of the Divinity.
Note.—Besides the Four Amenti, there were 42 Assessors or Judges of the Forty-two Crimes, from which a good man should be free, and these also differ from the 36 Demons mentioned by Origen, that presided over the human body, and were invoked to cure the infirmities of the peculiar member immediately under their protection.
Ho. 7, THE GODDESS 1 ISIS," or, The Seat." The hieroglyphic Throne on her head, and followed by the Priestesses and Virgins dedicated to her worship. Isis was styled also “ The Beginning,” (as her sister “ Nepthys” was “ The End” and “ Isis, Queen of Egypt,” “ The Goddess of the Moon," “ Defender of her Brother,” &c. (The “ Ceres’ of the Greeks.)
The festival, says Herodotus, which they celebrate at Busoris in honor of Isis, is magnificent. After prayers a Bull is sacrificed, which the Priests cut up and afterwards burn, pouring oil on the fire while the victim is consuming. Kneeling and striking themselves in honor of“ Osiris," they afterwards eat what remains of the sacrifice.
Tamarisk Dancers.
Ho. 8. THE GOD “ HORTJS," or (Khons-Horns).—The Apollo of the Greeks. In hieroglyph “ The Warmth of the Sun," “ The Path," (of the Sun) “ The Support,” a “ Detender of his Father,” &c. the son of Osiris and Isis,
He ia represented with the single mystic lock of Hair of Childhood, slaying his evil Geniuses, under the torms of the Lion, the Gazelle, Scorpion«, Vipers, Arc., while Typho, Typhon, 8eth or Baal, “ The Evil Spirit," is escaping from beneath his feet in the shape of a Crocodile.
He is attended by his sacred emblems and standards. The Hawk was dedicated to him, the Tamarisk tree, the Testudo, (Lyre) &c., &c.
One of the principal duties of “ Horns” was that of introducing the souls of the dead into the presence of “ Osiris,” after they had passed the ordeal of final judgment; he also assisted “Amset” in weighing and ascertaining their good conduct during life, previous to their admission into the august presence of his Father in the blessed regions of the Amenti.
Incense Bearers.
Ho. 9. THE GODDESS “HEPTHYS" (“Proserpine" of the Greeks), called also “ The End,” “ The Sister Goddess,” “ The Saviour 8ister Goddess,” “ The Barren,” *• Rectrix of the Lower Regions.” On her head the hieroglyphic emblem of her name, a bowl and basket called “ NAb,” placed upon a house, answering to “ Ei ” or “ Tei ”—“ NAb-tei” or “ NAb-thy," “ The Lady of the Abode.”
“ The Sistrum, having the face of Isis on one side, and Nepthys on til« other, symbolically represents ‘the Beginning' and ‘ the End,’ or ‘Generation and Corruption.’ "—Plutarch.
Ho. 10. THE GODDESS " HEITH," (the “Minerva” of the Greeks.) Enthroned, with sceptre, and wearing the “Teshr.” Preceded by Mnsicians, male and female, Bearers of Incense with green flame, and surrounded by symbolic Divinities.
“ Neith ” was styled “ The Mother Goddess," or “ Mother of Gods ”— “ The Deified personification of Air ” (Diodorus). She presided over the Upper Hemisphere, and was particularly worshipped at Sais. Stringed Musical Instruments (the Bonni, or Harp of 17 strings, especially) were dedicated to her. “ Neith ” or “ Neth,”jis the supposed origin of the Greek name, * Tbena ” or “ Athena."
The belief of the Egyptians in “ the Existence of a Supreme Being,” is proved by the inscription over the Temple of Minerva (Neith), in hieroglyphic characters, vi*.—“ I am that which is, which was, and shall be. No Mortal has lifted np my veil—the offspring of my power is the sun; and the Immortality of the Soul.” By the prayer recited at the time of death, by an Egyptian expressing his desire to be received into the presence of the deities.
Symbols of Map and Trfnu, and JEets or Athor.
Ho. 11. “JCERSEKAR,” the Snake Goddess, called also “Melsigor” or “ Mersokar ”—“ Ruler of the Lower Regions.”
Ho. 12. THE GREAT GOD ‘‘AMMON;" or «Hammon,” “Amen,” “ Amen-ra,” “ Amoun,” “ The King of Gods," “ The Concealed," “The Hidden," “The Intellectual Sun.” Wearing on his head the “ Tesher," surmounted by the Disc and Plumes. In his right hand the “ Tan,” or Emblem of Life, and in his left the “ Gom,” or Sceptre of Power.
A large Altar of Burning Incense is carried before him; on either side are his symbols of “ Creative power," the Sacred Ureus, or Serpent of Ammon,—Priests with crooks and fans, in their habits and insignia of the highest order, with the ASgis of the God—“ The Intellectual Sun ”—containing the symbolic “ Ail-seeing Eyes," “ The Divine Scarabeus" and the Ram-headed God, “Chnoumis,” the vernal creative intelligence or divinity.
THE KING AND QUEEN CROWNED.
The King bears in his hand the sceptre of “ Truth, Justice, and Mercy.” The Queen, that of the “ Sovereinty of the Nile.” They are preceded by Dancers and Musicians, Ladies and Officers of the Court and Household ; the God “ Eilethyia," or sacred vulture, “ The Protectress of Kings ”— “ The Pure," borne immediately in front of the royal personages; the State Flabella, behind and over their heads, together with the Banners of Nitocris and Egypt, flanked by the royal dakhs—dskhs of “ RA ” (the Sun); sacred symbols, with vsrious insignia, royal and military standards, &c., See.

“THE HIEXOORAHIA T,”
Or, Sacred Scribe.
(In his hand the Book, Ruler, Papyrus, and Paletie.)
Two Fokctionaribs with Emblems of“ Power” and “Stability.”
Ho. 1. THE ARK OR “¡SABINE OF KNOUMIS. (Called also “Knoum," “Neph,” or “ Num,” «.». "Water..") The primary form of “ Ammon,” and styled *' The Leader of Gods”—“ The Creative Intelligence”—“The Spirit of God”—“The Spirit of the (Vernal) Deity”—“The Soul of the Sun”—and, by the Greeks, “ Jupiter Chnumis.”
“ Worshipped by the inhabitants of Thebais” (Plutarch).
The Asp was sacred to this God.
The Ark, (bearing his hieroglyph, with that of the Beetle or “ Creative power,”) is decorated with this emblem.
Symbolic standard of “ Alhor"
(venns), the oracle of Night or Darknes (1 chaos), “from whence arose all created things”
(Egyptian belief).	,
THE SY’BIL, bearing the emblematic rush wand, with “ Heka,” “The Fryg” (the son of“ Num”), and type of the first state of man.
Symbolic standard of ditto.
No. 8, “ HA," " MEI,” or “THMEI,” or « Truth,” «the Blind Goddess,” Goddess,” represented with her eyes closed, or blinded.
The Priests bearing this Goddess have libation buckets and simpula.
“THMEI,” or TRUTH cr JUSTICE. This deity had also a twofold character, as Goddess of Truth and Justice. A small image of this God was worn by the Chief Judge while engaged in listening to cases brought before him.
A similar emblem was worn by the High Priests of the Jews, and It is remarkable that tha word “ Thummim” is not only translated “ Truthbut being a plural or dual word, corresponds to the Egyptian word of “ Two Truths''—».«. “Light and Troth.” Breastplates having the figures of the two Gods “ Be," (Light) and “ Thmei,” (Truth) represented upon them have been discovered.
Priests with Scarabs.
The Scarabeu* may be considered as an emblem of “The Sun”—of “The Creative power,”—and of the God “ Pthah,” (Vulcan).
Intense Bearer,
Waving his incense patera before the God. The incense was in the shape of a small globe or pill, and, upon modern analyst, was found to consist of aromatic substance* with gum, and gave out colored light or flame when thrown into the banting cup.
No, 8. “APIS,” His titles in hieroglyphs were “ The Sacred Bull of Memphis,” “ The Bull of Abundance, adored by the People,” “ The Sacred Bull of Pihah,” "Guardian of the Solar Year,” “ Api* renowned over the World,” “The Symbol of Inundation.”
Richly draped, and on a car led by Priests bearing the emblems of “Serapis,” or “Sari Api,” “The Pillar of Mensuration”—“Column of Measurement,” or “Nilometer,” of wood divided into cubit*.
Attendant Priest* also fan the Idol, and offer homage as it passe* forward.
The festivals in honor .of Apis lasted 7 days, on which occasion a large concourse of people assembled at Memphis—the Priests led the 8aered (living) Bull in solemn procession, every one coming forward from their houses to welcome him.
Pliny and Solinus affirm that children who smelt his breath were thought thereby gifted with the power of predicting future events.
The tokens which distinguished this sacred Hull at his birth were a white spot resembling a crescent on its right side, and a lump under its tongue in the form of a Beetle—as pretended by the Priests. The people believe him to be the cause of the swelling and inundation of the Nile, which produced fertility and abundance, and celebrated his festival at about the period of this annual oc< urrence, with every demonstration of rejoicing and literal abandonment to the intoxication of jov all over the kingdom.
N.B.—The decorations of the drapery upon the Bull and carriage are rinoipally composed of the first flowers that spring from the earth after the pecession of the flood, %.e. the Lotus and Meliolotus.
Priest* with the “frktkndkd” God "Canopus,” or Water ottering to the God ot the Nile,
“ It is said, that the Chaldeans, transporting the fire, which was their God, into ail the provinces, offered to let him combat with those of other nations, on condition that if he icmained the conqueror they should adore him. The Priests of Canopus accepted the challenge, and devised this stratagem :—They fabricate in Egypt pitchers of an extremely porous earth, through which the water filtrates and is purified. The Arch-Priest took one of them, stopped the pores with wax, and painting it of various oolors, filled it with water, and made it his God. He covered it with the head of an ancient statue, said to be that of the pilot Menelaus. The Chaldeans presented themselves; the Contest began, they lighted their fire around the vase, the wax melts, the water runs through the pores and extinguishes the fire; the fraud of the Priest gave the victory to Canopus over the Chaldean deity. From that moment his image has been represented with very short feet, a narrow neck, and the belly and hack rounded like a pitcher. It is under
this form that lie is worshipped as the vanquisher of all the Gods,”_Ruffin
Histoire de l' Kg Use, Here second.
No. 4. THE GODDESS PASH-T. ’ “The Memphian Lioness,” “The beloved of Pthah,” “The Goddess of Fire,” « Bubaates,” (the Diana of the Greek»), preceded by sacred dancers. The Idol, carried by Priests in their leopard-skin dresses, with red incense flaming before her, and .surrounded by “Symbolic Divinities,” “Winced Geniuses,” Ac.	'
One of the principal festivals held in Egypt was at Bubastes, in honor of Pash-t—700,GOo persons of both sexes being present. A great number of victims were sacrificed, wine was profusely drank, dancing of the wildest character went forward, men played flutes, women sang and shrieked as loud as possible, struck the“Crotola” (Cymbals) or Clappers of wood and metal, Ac, Lotus Dancers (females.)
Incense Bearers.
No. 5. THE GOD “OSIRIS.” as "Osiri* Pethempainentes” (the Pluto of the Greeks), “ He who is Resident in the Hades,” “ President of the Amenti,” “ Receiver and Giver,” “ The Sun,” “ The Eye of the World,” “ The Source of the Nile," “He who has many Eyes,” a form of Ammon, wearing the “ Atf,” and having the Crook and flagellum. Regarded as “ The authoi of time,” from the words “ Osoh-Iri,” •* The maker of time.”
The principal office of this Deity was to Judge the Dead, and to mle over that kingdom where the souls of good men were admitted to eternal fWicity.
This Deity was very famous, his Temples and Priests were to be found ia almost every part of Egypt, the sacred rite* of Osiris were a profound mystery, never revealed. His name even avoided, as of too august a nature to be mentioned.
The “Ivy,” with which the Priests decorated themselves, was sacred to him, and also the “ Meliolotns.”
No, 8. THE SACKED BOAT OF THE AMENTI, or Lower Regions,
with the Four Genii, or Demi-Gods (bearing emblems of Life and Power) and their vases of “ Amenti,” or that subterraneous region where they (the Egyptians) imagined the souls of the dead to go after their decease.
The 1st, genius is “ Amset,” “ Judge of the Amenti.” (Human headed.)
The 2nd is “ Hepi,” “ Concea ed Number.” (Baboon-headed.)
The 3rd is “ Tuautmutf,” “ Adorer of his Mother.” (Jackall-headed.)
The 4th is “ Kabh-senuf,” “ Refresher of his Brethren.” (Hawk-headed.)
The Sepulchral Vases have heads in shape of the Four Genii of the Dead, and each was employed for holding a portion of the Visera of the deceased, embalmed separately and deposited in them. On the “ A inset” Vase is inscribed the speech of “ Isis” to the dead ; on that of “ Hepi” is a similar speech from “ Nepthys;” on that of “ Tuantmutf,” one from “ Neith ;” and on that of “ Kabh-senuff,” one from “Seik.” The purport of each being an Assurance of Protection, and of being “ near thee,” “ beside thee,” or “ I come to be beeide thee.”	.
The Sacred Boat is followed by the symbolic “ Eyes of Osiris,” or, o(“ The Sun,” emblems of the all-seeing presence of the Divinity.
Note.—Besides the Four Amenti, there were 42 Assessors or Judges of the Forty-two Crimes, from which a good man should be free, and these also differ from the 36 Demons mentioned by Origen, that presided over the human body, and were invoked to cure the infirmities of the peculiar member immediately under their protection.

(The “ Ceres’ of the Greeks.)
The. festival, say* Herodotu*, which they celebrate at Boson* in honor of Isis, is magnificent. After prayers a Bull is sacrificed, which the Priests cut up and afterwards burn, pouring oil on the fire while the victim is consuming. Kneeling and striking thermelves in honor of“ Osiris,”, they afterwards eat what remains of the sacrifice,
Tamarisk Dancers.
No. 8. TBGE GOD “ HORUS,” or (Khons-Horus).—The Apollo of the Greeks. In hieroglyph “ The Warmih of the Sun,” “ The Path,” (of the Sun) “ The Support,” a “ Detender of his Father,” Ac. the son of Osiris and Isis.

He is attended by his sacred emblems and standards. The Hawk was dedicated to him, the Tamarisk tree, the Testudo, (Lyre) &c., &r.
One of the principal duties of “ Horns” was that of introducing the souls of the dead into the presence of “Osiris,” after they had passed the ordeal of final judgment; he also assisted “Amset” in weighing and ascertaining their good conduct during life, previous to their admission into the august presence of hi* Father in the blessed regions of the Amenti.
Incense Bearers.
No. fl. THE G0DDE88 “NEPTHYS" (“Proserpine” of the Greeks), called also “ The End,” “ The Sister Goddess," “ The Saviour Sister Goddess,” “ The Barren,” “ Rectrix of the Lower Regions.” On her head the hieroglyphic emblem of her name, a bowl and basket called “ N<B>,” placed upon a house, answering to “ Ei ” or “ Tei ”—“ Ndb-tei” or“N£b-thy,” “The Lady of the Abode.”

Stringed Musical Instrnments (the Bonni, or Harp of 17 strings, especially) Mere dedicated to her. “ Neith ” or “ Neth,”Js the supposed origin of the Greek name, “ Thena " or “ Athena.”
The belief of the Egyptians in “ the Sristonce o/'a Supreme Being" is proved by the inscription over ihe Temple of Minerva (Neith), in hieroglyphic characters, viz.—“ I am that which is, which was, and shall he. No Mortal has lifted up my veil—the offspring ot my power is the sun; and the Immortality of the Soul.” By the prayer recited at the time of death, by an Egyptian expressing his desire to he received into the presence of the deities.

THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GRAND CORONATION EGYPTIAN
ARRANGED AND ADAPTED TO THE STAGE, BY “ DYKWYNXYN,”
From the WerK* of Cllmkn», Herodotus, Strabo, Plutarch, Diodorus, Siculus, Jablou»ki, Leu.si us, Duke«, Chanfouivn,
Roskllini, Savary, Wilkinson, and other Authorities in the British Museum.
PROCESSION
MILITARY ENTREE.
EGYPTIAN SOLDIERY IN PULL COSTUME,
Mareting Three Deep,
With Band of Trumpets or Tympanum, or Hand Drum.
THE AGATHODAEMOtf,
Or “Good Genius" (winged globe), under whose protection the persons of Kings and Temple» of Gods were placed—is borne first, and in succession the other Symbolic, Royal, and War Standards.
THE LYBIAN FO RICES,
(Allies of tie Egyptians)
With Band and Symbolic Standards respectively.
THE ETHIOPIAN [GUARD,
With Characteristic Symbols, Standards, &c.
5. THE GOD “ OSIRIS." as «Osiris Pethemparaentes" (the Plui* of the Greeks), “ He who is Resident in the Hades,” “ President of the Amenti,” “ Receiver and Giver," “ The Sun," “ The Ej 0 of the World," “The Source of the Nile," “He who has many Eyes," a form of Ammon, wearing the “ Atf," and having the Crook and flagellum. Regarded as “ The authoi of time," from the Word* “Osch-Iri,” ‘The maker of time."
The principal office of this Deity was to Judge the Dead, and to mle over that kingdom where the souls of good m.n were admitted to eternal felicity.
This Deity was very famous, his Temples and Priests were to be found in almost every part of Egypt, the sacred rites of Osiris were a profound mystery, never revealed. His name even avoided, as of too august a nature to be mentioned.
The “ Ivy," with which the Priests decorated themselves, was sacred t* him, and also the “ Meliolotus."
IDOL AT K0U8 PROCESSION.
Nor*.—“ Every City, Month, Day, and Hour had its Presiding Genius."
Singer with the	j	Horus Copns, with
Book of “ Hermes."	( Palm Branch & Hour Glass.
“THE 8IESOORAKKA T,"
Or, Sacred Scribe.
(In his hand the Book, Ruler, Papyrus, and Palette.)
Two Functionaries with Emrlems of“ Power" and “Stability."
Ho I. THE ARK OR “ISARINE OF KNOUMIS." (Called also “ Knoura,” “Neph," or “Num,” e.i. “Water..") The primary form of “ Ammon," and styled “ The Leader of Gods’’-—“ The Creative Intelligence"—“The Spirit of God”—“ The Spirit of the (Vernal) Deity’’—“The Soul of the Sun"—and, by the Greeks, “ Jupiter Chnumis."
“ Worshipped by the inhabitants of Thebais" (Phttarch).
The Asp was sacred to this God.
The Ark, (bearing his hieroglyph, with that of ihe Beetle or “Creative power,") is decorated with this emblem.
Symbolic standard of “ Athor"
(Venus), the oracle of Night or Darknes (? chaos), “from whence arose all created things"
(Egyptian belief).	.
THE SYBIL, bearing the emblematic rnsh wand, with “ Heka," “The Fryg" (the son of“ Num”), and type of the first state of man.
Symbolic standard of ditto.
Ho. 2, “ MA,” " MEI,” or “ THMEI," or « Truth," «the Blind Goddess," Goddess," represented with her eyes closed, or blinded.
The Priests bearing this Goddess have libation buckets and simpula.
" THMEI," or TRUTH or JUSTICE. This deity had also a twofold character, as Goddess of Truth and Justice. A Hmall image of this God was worn by the Chief Judge while engaged in listening to cases brought before him.
A similar emblem was worn by the High Priests of the Jews, and it is remarkable that tho word “ Thumrnim" is not only translated “ Truth;" but being a plural or dual word, corresponds to the Egyptian word of “ Two Truths’ —i.e. ‘‘Light and Troth." Breastplates having the figures of the two Gods “Re,” (Light) and “Thmei,” (Truth) represented upon them have been discovered.
Priests with Scabab*i.
The Scarabens may be considered as an emblem of “ The Sun"—of “ The Creative power,”—and of the God “ Pthab," (Vulcan).
Incense Bearer,
Waving his incense patera before the God. The incense was in the shape of a small globe or pill; and, upon modern analyst, was found to consist of aromatic substances with gum, and gave out colored light or flame when thrown into the burning cup.
Ho. 3. “APIS.” His titles in hieroglyphs were “ The Sacred Bull of Memphis," “ The Bull of Abundance, adored by the People,” “ The Sacred Bull of Pthah," “Guardian of the Solar Year," “Apis renowned over the World," “ The Symbol of Inundation.”
Richly draped, and on a car led by Priests bearing the emblems of “Scrapie,” or “Sari Api," “The Pillar of Mensuration”—“Column of Measurement," or “Nilometer," of wood divided into cubits.
Attendant Priests also fan the Idol, and offer homage as it passes forward.
The lestivals in honor of Apis lasted 7 days, on which occasion a large concourse of people assembled at Memphis—the Priests led the Sacred (living) Bull in solemn procession, every one coming forward from their houses to welcome him.
Pliny and Solinus affirm that children who smelt bis breath were thought thereby gifted with the power of predicting future events.
The tokens which distinguished this sacred Bull at his birth were a white spot resembling a crescent on its light side, and a lump under its tongue in the form of a Beetle—as pretended by the Priests. The people believe him to be the cause of the swelling and inundation of the Nile, which produced fertility and abundance, and celebrated his festival at about the period of this annual occurrence, with every demonstration of rejoicing and literal abandonment to the intoxication of joy all over the kingdom.
N.B.—The decorations of the drapery upon the Bull aud carriage are rincipally composed of the first flowers that spring from the earth alter the Recession of the flood, i.e. the Lotus and Meliolotus.
Priests with the “ pretended" God “Canopus," or Water okpkrin« *o the God op the Nile.
“ It is said, that the Chaldeans, transporting the fire, which was their God, into all the provinces, offered to let him combat with those of other nations, on condition that if he lemsinad the conqueror they should adore him. The Priests of Canopus accepted the challenge, and devised this stratagem They fabricate in Egypt pitchers of an extremely porous earth, through which the water filtrates and is purified. The Arch-Priest took one of them, stopped the pores with wax, and painting it of various colors, filled it with water, and made it his God. He covered it with the head of an ancient statue, said to be that of the pilot Meuclaus. The Chaldeans presented themselves; the contest began, they lighted their fire around the vase, the wax melts, the water runs through the pores and extinguishes the fire; the fraud of the Priest gave the victory to Canopus over the Chaldean deity. From that moment his image, has been represented with very short feet, a narrow neck, and the belly and back rounded like a pitcher. It is under this form that he is worshipped ss the vanquisher of all the Gods."—Ruffin Htstoire de I'Eghse, Here second.
Ho. 4. THE GODDESS “PASH-T." “The Memphian Lioness," “The beloved of Pthah," “ The Goddess of Fire,” “ Bnbastes,’’ (theDiana of the Greeks), preceded by sacred dancers. T’H> Idol, carried by Priests in their leopard-skin dresses, with re I incense flaming before her, and .surrounded by “Symbolio DivIfcities," “Winged Geniuses." &c.
One of the principal festivals held in Egypt was at Bobastes, in honor of Pash-t—700,OOO persons of both sexes being present A great number of victims were sacrificed, wine was profusely drank, dancing of the wildest character went forward, men played flutes, women sang and shrieked as loud as possible, struck the“Crotola" (Cymbals) or Clappers of wood and metal, &c.
Lotus Dancers (females.)
Incense Bearers. .
Ho. 0. THE SACKED BOAT OF THE AMEHTI, or Lower Regions
with the Four Genii, or Demi-Gods (bearing emblems of Life and Power) and their vases of “ Amenti," or that subterraneous region where they (the Egyptians) imagined the souls of the dead to go after their decease.
The 1st genius is “ Amset,” “Judge of the Amenti.” (Human headed.)
The 2nd is “ Hepi," “ Concea'ed Number.” (Baboon-headed.)
The 3rd is “ Tuautmutf,’ “ Adorer of his Mother.” (Jackall-headed.)
The 4th is “ Kabh-senuf," “ Refresher of his Brethren.” (Hawk-headed.)
The Sepulchral Vases have heads in shape of the Fonr Genii of the Dead, and each was employed, for holding a portion of the Yisera of the deceased, embalmed separately and deposited in them. On the “ Amset” Vase is inscribed the speech of “ Isis” to the dead ; on that of “ Hepi" is a similar speech from “ Nepthys;" on that of “ Tuautmutf,” one from “ Neith j” and on that of “ Kabh-semiff," one from “ Selk." The purport of each being an Assurance of Protection, and of being “ near thee," “ beside thee," or “ I come to be beside thee,"
The Sacred Boat is followed by the symbolic “ Eyes of Osiris," or, of “ The Sun," emblems of the all-seeing presence of tbe Divinity,
Note.-—Besides the Four Amenti, there were 42 Assessors or Judges of the Forty-two Crimes, from which a good man should be free, and these also differ from the 36 Demons mentioned by Origen. that presided over the human body, and were invoked to cure the infirmities of the peculiar member immediately under their protection.
Ho. 7, THE GODDESS “ISIS,” or, “The Seat.’ The hieroglyphic Throne on her head, and followed by the Priestesses and Virgins dedicated to her worship. Isis was styled also “ The Beginning," (a» her sister “ Nepthys" was “ The End’’ and “Isis, Queen of Egypt," “ The Goddess of the Moon," “Defender of her Brother," &c. (The “ Ceres’ of tbe Greeks.)
The festival, says Herodotus, which they celebrate at Bnsoris in honor of Isis, is magnificent. After prayers a Bull is sacrificed, which the Priests cut up and afterwards burn, pouring oil on the fire while the victim is consuming. Kneeling and striking themselves in honor of“ Osiris," they afterwards eat what remains of the sacrifice,
Tamarisk Dancers.

He is attended by his sacred emblems and standards. The Hawk was dedicated to him, the Tamarisk tree, the Testudo, (Lyre) &c., &c.
One of the principal duties of “ Horus" was that of introducing the souls of the dead into the presence of “ Osiris," after they had passed the ordeal of final judgment; he also assisted “Amset’* in weighing and ascertaining their good conduct during life, previous to their admission into the august presence of his Father in the blessed regions of the Amenti.
Incense Bearers.
Ho. 0. THE GODDEBS “NEPTHYS" (“Proserpine" of the Greeks), called also “ The End," “ The Sister Goddess,” “ The Saviour Sister Goddess,” “ The Barren," " Rectrix of the Lower Regions.” On her head the hieroglyphic emblem of her name, a bowl and basket called “ Nèh,” placed upon a house, answering to “ II ” or “Tei ”—“ Néb-tei” or “ Néb-thy," “ The Lady of the Abode.”
“ The Sistrum, having the face of Isis on one side, and Nepthys on the other, symbolically represents ‘the Beginning' and ‘ the End,’ or ‘Generation and Corruption,’ ”—Plutarch.

The belief of the Egyptians in “ the Existence of a Supreme Being," is proved by the inscription over the Temple of Minerva (Neith), in hieroglyphic characters, viz.—-“I am that whieh is,which was, and shall be. No Mortal has lifted up my veil—the offspring of my power is the sun; and the Immortality of the Soul.” By the prayer recited at the time of death, by an Egyptian expressing his desire to be received into the presence of the deities.

DRURY-LANE.
IVthap» among the sea of heads that crowded old Drury tut night from floor to oeiliag some of Mr. Smith’s patroie (may have been grateful to him for introducing Madame tDassier to -he British public, while others may have been ¿Repos*? beforelmnd to encourage him in his promise to ¡provide cheap operatic nerformancea for the middle classes. But the vast majority had evidently errne to enjoy a Christmas pantomime of the olden time, worthy of the spirit, enterprise, and resources of the les.-ee., and they were not disappointed. The performances hagan with Little Todllekins and f ying it On, in which Mr. Charles Mathews
(displayed the inimitable peculiarities which have plared Sdm at the head of our light comedians. The pantomime i i entitled Uty Diddle Did tie, or Harlequin Kin' Nonsenst and the Seven Agei o] Man, After an overture, founded upon the popular air of the “ Ratcatcher's Daughter,” which was chanted and whistled in chorus by the 11 gods” with ” variations' that would b3va shocked Mr. ¡Samuel Cowell, the curtain rota upon the Hall of Nursery Rhymes, jn the dominions of Kiog Nonsense. This is the first of the Seven Ages, and the great monarch is surrounded by the heroes of nursery literature, the most easily recognised of -■„whom are—Little Jack Horner, Little Red Riding-hoodi Simple Simon, Old Mother Hubbard, and the Little Boy Blue, A praiseworthy feature of the pantomime which Immediately forced itself upon the attention was the artistic spirit and comic expression of the masks, deeignad by
Dykwynkyn.” The 11 Spirit of Common Sense” {Mias Beeves) proposes a compromise with King N'oteense (Mr. Ciindon), and bargains for a little more intellect in infant literature. .Routine and Red tape cliocseau unlucky moment for their entrance, since they find themselves vis t» vis with
the 1 Spirit of Common Sente/’ and a>e immediately fcaulshed to Noodledom. amid the execrations of the audience. “ Routine” had an office inkstand for a cap, carried despatches from the Baltic and the Crimea, and bore a legend purporting that hla “ office hours were from 1C to 4.” Hia follower, 11 Redtape,” elicited shouts of laughter, seeing ¿hat he looked like nothing bnt a gigantic bundle of that article taken from a stationer’s window. The second age* Jfchafc of the schoolboy, introduces us to the village of Pretty well, with a distant view of the church and surrounding country, so charmingly painted a hat a call was raised for “ Beverley.” Here we have ■ » village school with all sorts of schoolboy tricks, and a most severe pedagogue in Dr. Syntax, w'.o visits juvenile shortcomings with untiring severity until, playing at cricket with the boys on the border of the river, a vigorous and well-aimed ball knocks him into tho water,
to the intense delight of the juvenile portion of the audience. In the third age we have the lover “sighing like a furnace,” and in the fourth, the soldier *• bearded like a
i>ard.” A view among the old abbey min? here changes ntotlae “abode of love,” a scene of fairy-like beauty, that brought down thunders of applause, graced as it was by an admirable . rpsde ballet. A call was raised for Mr. Sinitb, who was compelled to come upon the stage and bow his acknowledgments. The fifth, sixth, and seventh ages had their appropriate characters, &c., until the scene changed from wintry scene of snow to the “ bright realms of perpetual hutunic i”~another glittering transformation, not unworthy of the Lyceum in its best days, than which no higher praise can be given. The plaudits excited by this splendid scene were continued until the lessee again presented himself. The introduction founded upon the “ Seven Ages of Man” was novel in conception and ingenious in execution, and this pirt of the pantomime gave unqualified satisfaction. Then began the transformation, which introduced the novelty of a double pantomimic corps to the audience. The Harlequins were Verroni and Furfch * the Columbines were Madame Boleno and Marie Charles ; the Pantaloons, Tanner and Den in Johnson; the Sprites, the brothers ( .Elliot; and the Clowns, Harry Boleno and Tom Matthews, j the latter of whom won great popularity by the readiness with which he sang “ Tipplty wltebet” and the “ Life of a Clown.” The effect of these double engagements was to give unwonted activity and emulation to the dancing mo pantomimic actiDg. The great event selected for eat*:e was the Paris Exposition where Clown and Panta-8ocn are reduced to engage a bed in a coal hole, and, ¡taking wrongful possetsion of a bedroom not tbeir own, ¡find their bed riee 20 feet in the air. The usual interrap-iior s and ccmtrelemjts ocour to banish sleep, but the Clown BeiB everything right by laying about him with a huge warming pan—a habit apparently “more honoured in the breach than in the observance.” Then we have puffs of some g^e&t advertising city houses, which paint shop fronts xcr stage exhibition as other1 print posting bills. In these scenes the fan frequently halted and went lame, and even thetrlcku and transformations refused to run smoothly. The audience were now and then impatient, but upon the whole made the usual allowance for Boxing-night. A little excision here and there, and a little mere practice, will, doubtless, improve this portion of the pantomime. A sresfc brilliant scene cf fairyland concluded the pantomime at a late hour, and sent every one home in good humour. The pantomime is from the pen of Mr. E. L. Blanch a id.

to the intense delight of the juvenile portion at the “ “ third age we have the lover " sjg‘‘	“
audience. In the third age we bava the lover "sighing like a furnace,’’ and In the fourth, the soldier 11 bearded like a card.” A view among the old abbey ruins here changes into the "»bode of love,” a scene of fairy-like beauty, that Brought down thnndere of applause, graced aa it was by an admirable corps de ballet. A call was raised for Mr. S mltb, who was compelled to onme upon the stage and bow his acknowledgments. The fifth, sixth, and seventh ages had their appropriate characters, &c., until the scene changed from a wintry scene of snow to the ” bright realms of perpetual eum-m<l”—another glittering transformation, not unworthy of the Lyceum in its best days, than which no higher praise cart fee given. The plaudits excited by this sp'endld scene were continued until the lessee again presented himself. The introduction founded upon the “ Seven Ages oi Men” wet novel in conception end ingenious in execution, and this
ps rt of the pantomime gave unqualified satisfaction.
JK

ben began the transformation, which introduced the ■ novelty of a double pantomimic rnrps to the audience. ; The Harlequins were Vernad and Fnrth ; the Columbine* wet# Madame Bolono and Marie Charles ; the Pantaloons, Tenner end Deuln Johnson ; the Sprites, the brothers .Billot; and the Clowns, Harry Boleno and Tom Matthews, the latter of whom won greet popularity by the readiness , with which be sang “ Tippitywltchet” and the “ Life of a down.” The effect of these double engagement» was to give unwonted activity and emulation to tha dancing and pantomimic acting. The great event selected for *att:e wae the Peris Exposition where Clown and Pantaloon are reduced to engage a bed in a ooal hole, and, taking wrongful poesefsion of »bedroom not their own, find their bed rise 20 feet in the air. The usual in term p-tlor s and contretemps ooour to banish sleep, but the Clown
sets everything right by laying about him with a huge warming pan—a habit apparently "more honoured In the Broach than la the observance.” Then wo have puffs of

In these scenes the fun frequently halted end went lame, and even the tricks and transformations refused to run smoothly. The audience were now end then impatient, but upon th* whole mad* th* usual allowance for Boxing-night. A little extisionber* and there, and » little more practice, will, doubtless, improve this portion of the pantomime, A most brilliant scene of fairyland concluded the pantomime at a late hour, end sent every one home In good humour.

DRURY LANE THEATRE.
Lafct night ft dramatic 44squill’ ^^tled the (Trent Gun Tricky was let off with success. jyfr c. M«thews represents one of those ingenious g^oiemen, light in pocket and fertile in brain, who havq jonjT lived easily in the atmosphere of farce, his vocation for the moment being that of a conjuror, after the fashion of the ** Wizard of the North/’ He has, moreover, been saved from drowning at Valtrie-sur-Somme by a mysterious fair one, and, having recognized her during one of his performances, attired in a certain bonnet, has issued an advertisement, inviting her to reappear. Thus we see, not only is the gene* ral entertainment of the “ Wizard” selected for the mark at which the “ squib” is thrown, but also allusion is made to that pleasing nttle romance of real life which formed the subject of one of the most celebrated placards connected with Ms Lyceum management.
The stage in fitted up as if for a legerdemain performance, and Mr. Charles Mathews, aided by Mr. Rogers and a couple of small assistants, goes through a series of tricks, some merely burlesque, others really clever imitations of conjuring. These tricks, too, are worked into a little plot. A sheriff’s officer endeavours to arrest the conjuror in the midst of his achievement«, but is made to vanish by means of a gigantic extinguisher. A creditor who gets on the stage, on pretence of aiding in the performance, likewise proves restin', but a 100f.-note is coni tired out of his
{lossession by means of two magic boxes, while in place of it lehastlie warrant with which ho furnished the sheriff’s officer. When Soplionisbo, the heroine of Yal£rie-sur-8omme, is at last discovered in a private box, and turns out to be the daughter of the ham-hearted dun, who relents and places the hand of his child in that, of the conjuror, the sheriff is allowed to re-appoar through a chest of drawers, and, by way of a “ tag” Mr. Rogers throws a handful or two of bon-bons to the audience.
The gist of this trifle consists in the felicity with which Mr. C. Mathews assumes the important air of the real conjuror, as though every trick he performed was an act of condescension, while his assistantsbustling about the stage, and doing nothing, with all the pomp of King exceedingly busy, keen up the illusion. Hut what is most remarkable is the suddenness with which Mr. Charles Mathews, at the commencement of his tricks, actually assumes the appearance of the “ Wizard of the North.” indeed, the audience last night, literally roared with delighted astonishment when they saw the favourite comedian transformed into the famous “professor” before their very eyes, with scarcely any means beyond a power over the countenance.

PRCHY-IíANK.
Drury-lane ha» commenced its Eastei campaign with opero, and last night an English version of Verdi’s very | tragic Tromlorc was produced, in presenoe oí an audience that filled the theatre to the roof.
As our readers may have no vivid remembrance of the plot concocted by Signor Salvadora Cammarano, from the Spanish melodrama of Garcia Gutierres, and for the benefit i in of those who did not witness the performance of the late *	JB)3|
* establishment in Covent-garden, we subjoin a brief sketch v ™ of H Trovafore, or, as It is appropriately re-christened *r**m*mri hj Mr. C. Jefferya, author of the English translation.
The Oipsu'n Vengeance. Azucena, a Gipsy, to revenge her mother who was burnt at the stake by order of the old Count de lama, steals a child of the Count from the cradle, and consigns it, as she Imagines, to the flames. By an oversight,
y however, which to say the least must be accounted singular, she sacrifices her own sou In lieu of her enemy’s, and, in-ptead of wreaking vengeance immediately on the survivor Of this second crime, more horrible than the first, defers the execution of her purpose in order to effect It iu a more deliberate manner. Azucena brings up the child as her own under the name of Manrico; and as he gradually attains manhood envenoms his mind with sentiments of jealousy and hatred against the house of Luha, hoping by means of plots and etrotagems to make him eventually kill his rider brother, who, in course of time, succeeds to the title and posses alona of the Count. After several rencontres and combats, which end in nothing, Manrico (who, though disguised, as a troubadour, the more secretly to pursue an amour with lW'm Leonora, a young lady to whom his brother has become
equally attached, is a soldier by profession) falls into the £ bands of Do Luna. The Count, not knowing him, condemn8 ‘g him to be decapitated; Leonora, reciprocating Manrico’s pas-ion, and resolved not to Survive him, swallows poison > and the Gipey, who at the instant the trouhadcur is being Executed reveals to the Count the secret that it is his brother, is condemned to be burnt alive, like her mother.
She lias expiated her parent’s death, however, and is careless of her own. What happens to the Count, thus robbed at a blow of mistress and brother, does not transpire, since iM this edifying juncture the urn-tain falls.
The opera of J7 Trovahire has been classed, ho far as tho * music is concerned, among Verdi's best, and not without worn? reason, for, while there is an abundance of feeble
I pieces in the first two acts, there are several very pleasing Compositions in the third ami fourth—the “ Miserere,” and
Ithe duet and trio of the last scene, where the death of XiMnora occurs, more especially, which are full of character and fooling. The execution last night, considering the
r. means at disposal, was creditable to the present temporary I management and to Mr. Tidly, director of tho orchestra.
■ A hand of about M) players, all zealous, if not all good, a u chorus of some S’», and a troupe of “ principals” oomnoaod IT I of singer familiar to the publii. had been got together for the occasion; and all seemed to havo studied their parts
M, Con amort, since they were at least note-perfect in , the music. Madame Lucy Escort, in spite ot faults * of method and a prevalent tendency to exaggeration, exhibited many good qualities as Leonora, and her singing, if wanting in style, was often remarkable for energy and as often for real sentiment. Miss Fanny ilnddart
■ does not possess the to'» tragim in a startling degree, but she has a fine contralto voice, and in a great deal of the music of Azucena distinguished hot self most favourably. In short she did enough in this very diflicult character to encourage a hope of stiU hotter things to come. If Mr. Henri JDmyton, mm; who sang and acted the )*art of Count i>o Lnna with decided intelligence, would be less mysterious, and aim at fewer *' points," bo might, we arc satisfied, accomplish more. In Hie pretty romance of the second act, for instan oc (“f?
.balen), he obtained a loud and unanimous encore ; and the ©ffeol he produced was in a great measure due

Mr. Augustus Braliam was overtaxed in BW 't Manrico, an extremely trying part, and too often damaged § g $
* f the quality of Ids Voice by forcing. When he sang without , J effort- -as in the “ Miserere,” and some passages of the duet * with Azucona in the last act—hc sang beat; but when he ■exerted hunself he lost all command of his means and his voice sounded harsh and toneless which, considering that it is so good a one,was » pity. Mr. Farquhurson did his utmost f for the little character of Ferrando. The wise re settle Was careful, and tho two tableaux of the Gipey’s abode and the «nemrpment were generally »dnrired.
The audim ce was invariably good-humoured and indnt-sent, as befits an audience in tho holydays. Although there were long pauses between the acts, and the house was Inconveniently crowded, the signs of impatience were manifested gently and without tnalice. Every thing waff applauded, good, bail, and indifferent; iite principal singers were «ailed before the curtain frequently; and at the end, the f success of which was unequivocal, there was an extra summons for Mr. Tully, who was led on by Madame Lucy Becott. The entertainments concluded at a late hour with
Ttlie “sketch” of Marguerite (music by Mr. TuUy) in which Misses Fanny Reeves and Dyer (Faust ami Marguerite),
E Messrs. J, Halford and Maurers (Mepiustophele. and /Valentine) appeared, with other performers less known to fmm,. Thu was wall put upon the stage; the ballet department was not inefficient; Mr. Halford displayed quaintness

THE STORY. —Fifteen Years before the action of the Drama commences, an old gipsy woman, the mother of Azueena, had been burnt as a Witch, by order of the old Count di Luna: Azucena, in revenge, stole the child of the Count intending to destroy him, but in her phrenzy she threw her own child into the fire. On recovering from her temporary madness, she saw with horror the crime she had committed i stung with remorse, she nurtured the Count's child as her own. When the Drama commences it will be seen that Manrico, the name given by the Gipsy to her adopted son, had become the accepted lover of Leonora, whose affections were sought also by the young Count, the unknown brother of Manrico. Hatred, and a desire to be revenged upon his rival, caused the Count to attempt the life of Manrico in a duel. In this he failed, and afterwards learning lrom the Gipsy Woman, who is arrested, that she is the mother of Manrico, he causes both to be con demned—the one as a spy, the other as a traitor. Manrico is beheaded; and immediately after his execution Azucena proclaims to the Count that Manrico—murdered by his hands—was not her son, but hi* brother, and thus the Drama concludes.

X Alarm. ol< F=ke at Drury lane Theatre.—
Early yester«! y morning tlere was an alarm of fire at ’ Drury-lane Theatre, which arose under the following circumstances :- lr appears that at the conclusion of the performances on Saturday niglil, the committee of the tl.eatre, according to previous arrangement, arrived upon the stage for the purpose of witnessing some experiments with
Phillips’s patent lire fuinihilrtors, in order to test their ap-plicahility in case of lire recurring within the building. Mr. Curtis, the secretary of tic Aimiliilator Company, some ; of his men, and a number of machines were taken upon the ‘ stage, while the hands employed in the theatre were in other parts of the house, t-o be ready to assist in case anything should arise to demanl their services. The perform- . ances commenced w ith a tiial between the patent handpump, such as is used by the fire brigade, and one or two . small anniliilators, to see which could most quickly jx-tinguLsh the lights burning ii the battens over the stage. These battens are about 40 feet high, and have each a great number of perforations to Ulow the gas to escape so as to illuminate ihe top of the stage and ‘‘ borders/’ Three firemen, named Samuel Garrard, John Jones, and J. W*dister, were engaged working the hand pumps aiul discharging water over the gas ;ets to ascertain which would most effectually extinguish tie flame. The w ater from the pumps for some time appeared to prove of greater advantage than the small annihilating machines, v. hen it was propose«! by Mr. Curtis, the secretary, tliat one of the Larger machines, draw a upon two wheels, should he tried. This v :v accordingly done, and the carriage having been placed near the centre of the sta--\ a large iron funnel, 15 feet in length, was attach- d for the purpose of assisting the vapour to reach the gas burning in the fattens. The signal having been given, the man in ¿charge of the annihilator br<>ke the bottle containing the acid, winch ignit/.l the composition, and the vapour com-meiiced to escap -. but in a few seconds tin funnel, through which the gas generated in tie machine was passing, blew . off, aud was projected up t-o the flies and lodged undei the bridge of the stage hi a heated state. At the same time the cap rr lid of the annihilator vas blown off, which knocked down the man having charge of the apparatus, and passed by him to a distance of 35 feifc. The machine then threw up such a vast body of fire that every one in the theatre apprehended its entire destruction. Fortunately, the firemen had taken the precaution to hav e their engines , placed upon the stage and clarged with water, ami they J were therefore enabled withoit the lea.st delay to render assistance. So great was tht concussion caused by the explosion, that another annilifiator standing on the stage rolled away, and having hr««aen the iron and glass of five of the floats, it fell into the orchestra, demolishing one of the music-stands and upafftiig the seats. This ro alarmed the committee that they rushed out into the street, and a
cry >i “ fire’-' was at one».- given, which caused the engines tu arrive in Tie course of a ftw minutes. Tire firemen con nected with the theatre, however, managed t-o get the fire , i subdued, and before any great damage was done, the only f part that was burnt througi the -urfaceof the woodwork i being a beam under the briige »f the first tier of flies. The man who had charge of the machine was severely s burnt by the force of steam tliat escaped when the explosion "tookplace. Mr. Tucker, lie master carpenter, was also burnt in his hands by the rush of steam. A man named Watson «' as likewise badly burnt, and was taken by f.yons, | the gasman, to the hoq-ital, tut was i->on enabled to return home. As to tlie m .else cause of the explosion nothing t positive could be asoeri.amed, but it is supposed that the li«1 -or top of the machine c*uld not have been properly rivetted cn, as the machines are invariably strong enough to bear the force of the charge they contain.

DRURY-LANK THEATRE.

Thera is now to be seen fit this hour« a specimen of Transatlantic acting which ought not to bo overlooked by any one who has a taste for curiosities in histrionio art. Mrs. Florence, newly arrived from the United States, whom she has gained a considerable reputation, represents hi a " fkree called the Yankee Rousekeepr* a “gal" from the Stato of Maine, who combines such a highly coloured assemblage oí nativo peculiarities as has never been witnessed on any Kuropean stage. The dialect in of the strongest flavour I, —the prosaio shrewdness accompanying an almost boisterous vivacity betokens a development of the 'cute organa that the dull titirens of the Old World would scaicely associate with their notions of the feminine nature * j the gestugee are of the strangest and, at the same time, o* ! the most significant kind, but all »0 perfectly freo and spontaneous as to leave no doubt that a real type of the Anglo-Saxon family has been truly apprehended by a quids and observant' intellect. Tho Yankee " gal,” of humblo life, ee delineated by Mrs. Florence, is a being to whom half-measures are unknown, and who would bo dread-1 fully pauled if she had to find an English equivalent for the French word nuance. If she is abashed she buries her face in her apron—if she Is kindly disposed to an admirer she pokes him in the ribs—if she feels bar dignity compromised her first tendency is to slap the face of the offender- if the desire of gaining a " hard dollar” steal." upon her miml, she scons everything like a hint, and with the most businesslike air asks, “ What »111 you gi'e me V And all tlp* « ho heartily done, with such an appearance of intrinsic frank, L, ness and good-nature, that the result is almost f.-ocmaliag, HM while the movements acquire a sort of •$dive grace from their uncontrolled wildness. Wo have had plenty of male delineators of Yankee peculiarity, and some of tin »0, we suspect, have rather owed their position to thocircumslai. ces of being boro amid the sound of a certain dialect than to any distinctive talent; but from these Mss. Florence is wholly distinct. She literally Bparkle.s with vivacity; and. while much of her attraction depends on tho novelty Mr of tho character aha representa, she must convince every spectator that, under whatever circumstances she had made ] her studies of humanity, she still would hare been an inttlii- | . gent and uffleient actress. We must only warn those who witness her not to test her merits by any existing standard, for something so utterly mi generis is not to be measured by English rute. Let her revelations of Maine manner.) be accepted in a spirit of faith; let her two Yankee souqs, I which are admirable of tho kind, be heard and laughed at as worthy pendants to “Asyllikins and Ills Dinah,” and • ‘The Ratcatcher's daughter,” let a sympathy witli her obvious geniality he encouraged, and an audience can
f scarcely fail to ho alike entertained and surprised.
Mr. Florence, by whom the lady is accompanied, is an »otor of Irish parts, with s great deal of quiet humour, and a brogue that is not altogether of tho Ci*-AUsntia kind. Of the fareo wo i*q»d not say much. It is a very primitive, •affair, hot as it se+veBto allow the Yankee “gal” full opportunities to display her peculiarities, it fully answer-, its purpose.

At the termination of one portion of the ENGLISH OPERATIC SEASON, the Directors feel it their duty to acknowledge the liberal support of the public in aid of their endeavours to restore ENGLISH OPERA to the position it ought to occupy in the largest city of the civilised world. Within the space of two mouths they have produced THE BOHEMIAN GIRL; FRA DIAVOLO; LUCIA D1 LAMMERMOOR; and THE DAUGHTER OF THE REGIMENT;—they have also had the good fortune to present to the public an English version of M IL TROVATORE'' (The Gypsy’s Vengeance), with a success almost unexampled in the annals of the Operatic Drama.	•	.
The approbation of the public has been signified in a manner most gratifying to the Directors—crowded audiences night after night have testified their pleasure by the most enthusiastic applause : while the Press, by its invariably favorable notices of the performances, has most liberally aided the exertions of the Directors.
In reference to the future, it will be the endeavour of the Managers to transcend all their previous efforts. In addition to the immediate production of ROSSINI’S celebrated Opera, “CINDERELLA,” they have engaged Mr. CHARLES JEFFERYS, the adapter of the English version of “IL TROVATORE," to render into English an Opera by BATTISTA, performed in NAPLES UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS, and which will speedily be produced at this Theatre under the title of “ ESMERALDA.”
In the belief that English Opera is now established ON A FIRM BASIS, the Directors look forward with hopeful confidence that in coming Seasons the numbers of their supporters will so increase, thal eventually the LOVERS OF MUSIC, OF ALL CLASSES, will become the warm supporters of the Operatic Company, at the GREAT NATIONAL’ THEATRE.

L. I S H __	________________
At the termination of one portion of the ENGLISH OPERATIC SEASON, the Directors feel it their duty to acknowledge the liberal support of the public in aid of their endeavours to restore ENGLISH OPERA to the position it ought to occupy in the largest city of the civilised world. Within the space of two months they have produced THE BOHEMIAN GIRL ; FRA DIÀVOLO; LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR; and THE DAUGHTER OF THE REGIMENT;—they have also had the good fortune to present to the public an English version of “ IL 'PROVATORE” (The Gypsy’s Vengeance), with a success almost unexampled in the annals of the Operatic Drama.
The approbation of the public has been signified in a manner most gratifying to the Director«—crowded audience» night after night have testified their pleasure by the most enthusiastic applause : while the Press, by its invariably favorable notices of the performances, has most liberally aided the exertions of the Directors.
In reference to the future, it will he the endeavour of the Managers to transcend all their previous efforts. Iu addition to the immediate production of UOSiSINPS «elebrotcd Opera, “CINDERELLA,” they have engaged Mr. CHARLES JEFFERYS, the adapter of the English version of “IL TROVATORE,” to render into English an Opera by BATTISTA, performed in NAPLES UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS, and which will speedily be produced at this Theatre under the title of “ ESMERALDA.”
in the belief that English Opera is now established ON A FIRM BASIS, the Directors look forward with hopeful confidence that in coming .Seasons the numbers of their supporters will so increase, that eventually the LOVERS OF MUSIC, OF ALL CLASSES, will become the warm supporters of the Operatic Company, at the GREAT NATIONAL THEATRE. Negotiations are pending with many of our most eminent Native Composers for the production of their Works, in due course.

UR UR Y LA N E THE A THE.
Mrs. Florence, the American actress, who astonished the \ London world by the truly “go-a-head7’ geniality with wliich she made her debut in the Yankee H'onscJo ipcr, does ' not repose un the effect of a first, sensation. Another piece, not a whit better than the first, considered as a drama, but well adapted to the same purpose of displaying the New England ‘ ‘ sta r,” exhibits her in a new light. As the ‘ ‘Yankee j housekeeper” she made us learned in Maine peculiarities of
*	voice and manner; mMi&'h n com Aar. ie (the newer piece] she ^
■	successively represents half-a-dozen different characters,!
*	comprising a .Spanish dancer and a British tar, who e\*e * J cutes a hornpipe. Various, however, as are the parts she i § assumes, she shows in them all that reckless abandonment \ f to the spirit of the situation that constitutes her principal £ s charm, and distinguishes her from every contemporary!
tress, \\ lien she dances a hornpipe she does not soften it | into a lady-iike sort d affair, but fearlessly puts on long! familiarity with salt-water usages; when she takes the | character nf a- semi-idiot .die enlarges the smile to one‘S ^ huge vacant grin, and deluges her head with a cataract
*	of dishevelled hair. Possibly she may now and then lay herself open to a charge of exaggeration, but her very style shows that such a charge would cause her small annoyance. Weakness he would shun at any price, but she would not flinch from a little extra demonstration of strength; she resolve to colour highly, and .she carries out her resolution
■	to the utmost. Where others of her compatriots have gained mild appro val by copying the manners of their Transatlantic home, she has created a sort of furore, is talked about as , one of the notabilities of the day, and is selected for imita- ' tion by Mi*. Woodin, as a figure with which every one is supposed to be familiar. This is a pure triumph of originality.

Tt 5a a long time since such »crowd her keen assembled! within the wall« of Drury-lane Theatre as that which waa| attracted last night by the programme announced for the! benefit of Mr. Baife. Hundreds were sent away from! boxes, pit, and galleries, and before the curtain drew epj there was no standing room in any part of the house.!
And (this notwithstanding that the prices were raised! to more than double tho tariff lately established.!
The partisans of an English national opera quanefl mfme were strengthened In their arguments by the result — f since, with all his well earned popularity, the name of Mr. I Baife would hardly hare been sufficient to draw together j such an overflowing audience, unless accompanied by the I promise of a genuine musical performance.	TJ01
The entertainments began with the Bohemian Girl, of ( which the English (like the German) public would seem never tobetired. The distribution of characters Included Mr. and Mr*. Sims Reeves, as Thaddeus and Arline, Miss Dyer, as the Oipsy Queen, Messrs. Manvers, Weiand H. Drayton, jj J as Tlorostan, Count Arnbelm, and Devilshocf. The opera has very rarely been better played, nor was it ever received with greater favour. Mr. Beeves sang the music of Thad* dem in his best manner, and was encored with enthusiasm in both his ballads. Not to enter Into details, however— which about so familiar a work and so familiar a oast would be wholly superfluous—it is enough to add that every one engaged displayed a real worthy of unqualified praise. Mi.
Baife, «hose appearance via acknowledged by tumultuous applause, was the conductor) and the presence of Urn composer himself in the orchcsti a no doubt stimulated all tho performers to do their utmost. At the conclusion Mr. llalfo wag summoned before the certain; and then Mr. and Mrs. Sims Reeves, lu compliance with the unanimous da. mand of the house, came forward, with the others.
Besides The Bohemian Girl there was a vocal and instrumental ooncert of varied attraction. Between tho first and sooond act* of the opera Madame Viardot Oarcia sang tha rondo Jinnlc to The Maid of Artois (originally composed for hersisxer, the famous Malibran) and was encored. After tho opera there was a miscellaneous selection, among the most interesting features of which were several of Mr. Balfe's
recent compositions, and especially some of the settings of ‘ ‘ '	‘ already gained *	*	‘
Eongfellow, which have popularity. The graceful
_____	„_____ such universal
_____„______________H ballads, “ Green Tree«,” and
‘ This is this place, stand still my steed,” and “ Trust her not,” a duet of more quaint and romantic, although not less melodious, character, were sung respectively by Missed I Dolby, Fanny Hnddart, 0. Brougham, and 3. Brongham, with the greatest success. ‘'The C.reon Trees” being -"Wda«» redemanded, Miss Dolby, strangely enough, substituted her eternal “Over the Be»." Signor larrenso gavo f. ' the arid Iniffa “II Karin” (tho “First kiss") With (*”'li t? remarkable spirit; and other pieces were intrusted to Mrs. Enderssolm. M. Gassier, Mr. Uaigh, Ac. Thdif instrnmental performances comprised a grand dnet fori"
. two pianofortes, on subjects from L’Eioili du Not'd, |*r-formod in brilliant stylo by Miss Aralvella (ioddard ...	and Mr. Osborne (its composer) ; a harp solo by
Mr. Thomas; and Ernst’s Airs Hongmis, executed with admirable taste and skill by the great German i violinist, who retired amid reiterated plaudits. The hour ; of midnight had passed, and *he last act of Verdi’s Trovatore, in English, was still tocome with Misses LuoyEsoott and Fanny Huddart, Messrs. Augustus Braham and Durand in the principal parts. So it could uot lie said that the vast audience had not enough for their money, with whatever ..
Iiastme, on the other hand, it might be insinuated that thny ; had too mitr/i. if they w. nt home with a surfeit they bava !
Mr. Baife to thank for it. Hod ho presented them with K, one third less, he would, in all probability, have afforded!
’ them equal gratification.

and at the aauie time' most piquant manner. So was she at her ease in the delivery of
perfectly	JHÜHHHIHHP
ner dialogue and in all her gestures that nothing in het performance, except her extremely youthful appearance, marked the dtbuJante, The favourite song, “I’ve no money,* sung with the nicest feeling, revealed the possession k * of a sweet soprano voice, and was enthusiastically encored. Peter Spyk, played originally by Mr. Keeley, was sustained by Mrs. Keeley on this occasion, and admirably did she give ail the phases of indifference and passion through which the thick-skinned swain is forced to pass tiíl he acquires the highest degree of sensibility. With the exception of Mr. Knox, jun., who skilfully contrived to raise the small part of Delve to a degree of prominence which would scarcely be expected from it, there was nothing remarkable in the rest cf the characters. ¿V*-*? ^
To night (Monday) Mr. Bunn will take a benefit at this theatre, ana a combination of talent collected from various
i directions will be formed for the occasion.
¿V %jl % A'wmrxjritm: M
course of the last yeat and a half hare made so oonspicuom a figure in our metropolis performed for tho first time before a general publio,—that is to say admission was not eonfinad	v^
to the holders of pre-purchased tickets. The profits " ' derived from their more private exhibition* had been devoted to charitable purposes, and the object of Saturday’s performance was the establishment of a fund, to be entitled the •• Fielding Fund,” for the immediate relief of emergencies in the literary or theatrical world. Provincial and suburban readers may re quire to be told that the word “ Fielding ” haa reference to a club of that name, of which most of the amateur* are member*.
The house was crowded in every part, and from the mirth which was exhibited by the audience we may arrive at the conclusion that an amateur pantomime ia an article that will stand wear and tear better than the generality of repeated pleasantries. The pantomime was William Tell, which we noticed last month, when it was first played at the Lyceum by the same company, and we have only to say ihat all the parties concerned in it sustained their established character for humour, spirit, and agility.
However, particular interest attached on this occasion to Mr. Plauché’s farce, the Tjoan of a lboeer, whioh preceded the pantomime. The leading patrons of amateur performances are usually acquainted with the secrets of the rouliseee, and it was well known to a large portion of the audience that the young lady who under the name of Louisa Millar made her “ first appearance on any stage” in the character of Gertrude was a member of oijp of the most esteemed theatrioal families in London. Jt •’storm of applause greeted her as she first came forward, accoutred in • smart Netherland costume, in which the gold helmet, celebrated by Mr. Albert Smith, played a conspicuous part —the beau ideal of a Flemish beauty. Sanguine as the expectations wore, they were more than justified by the performance of the interesting young débutante. The character of Gertrude admits the greatest delicacy of interpretation. Shu is a kind-hearted creature who has been generally neglected on account of her poverty, and has set her heart on a loutish youth, who never finds out that he is in love with her till he lias reason to believe that she will be given to another. She endeavours to awaken the affections of the stolid Peter, and the vexations that arise when he will not understand the meaning of the fond little being at his elbow, but goes on hurting her feelings by alluding to every woman in the world except herself, afford opportunities for a thousand pretty taniles and pouts, indicating hopes awakened to be immediately ere shed--momentary triumphs and deep humiliations. All the rapid changes of emotion that pass through the mind of the young beauty were expressed by Miss	—”
