The charming afterpiece of Figaro, or i/ie Follies of a Day. has been revived here, and revived with all its gloss - and lustre. Miss Kfu.y, Mrs. Ai.soi>, and Mrs. Obgeb, T" were all very hanpy in it. '-This play was written by a , »nan who drank light French wines: in every line you see ' _Al the brisk Champagne frothing through green glasses. The lieads rise sparkling to the surface, nnd then evaporate. There is- nothing m it to remember, and absolutely no,	.. thing to criticise; but it is the triumph of animal spirits;
' while you see it, you seem to drink ether, or to inhale an ■	. ,	' atmosphere not bred of fogs or sea-coal fires. This is the
secret of the charm of Figaro. It promote« the cifcula-. ‘ tion of the blood, and assists digestion. We would by •	-	*(( means advise our readers to go and try the experiment.
The best scene in it is that in which the Page jumps from .	•	bis concealment behind the arm-chair into the arm-chair
>	1	itself. The beauty of this is in fact the perfect heurl-fell
indifference to detection ; and so of the rest.—We never 'saw Mr. Rat. play better.

DRrnr-i.Mi.
Tue Managers of Covent-garden Theatre, after haying an- . nonncvd in the bills that Mr. Booth’s Richard the T/tird had met with a success unprecedented in the annals of histrionic fame, (which, to do them justice, was not the case) very disinterestedly declined engaging him at moro than two pounds a week, as report speaks. Now we think they were wrong, either in puffing him so unmercifully, or in haggling with- him so pitifully. It was either trifling with the public or with the actor. The consequence. as it has turned out, has been, that Mr. Booth, who was to start as “ the fell opposite” of Mr. Ktw, has been taken by the hand by that gentleman, who was an okl fellow comedian of his in the country, and engaged at DrVy-IàtHt at a salary of ten pounds per week. So we hear. And it was. in evident allusion to this circumstance, that when Mr. Booth, as logo, »aid on Thursday night, * I know my price no less”— John Bull, who has very sympathetic pockets, gave a loud shout of triumph, which resounded along ail the benches of the pt*. We must say that M r. Booth pleased us much more io '/ago than in Richard. He was, it is true, well supported by Mr. Kean in Othello, but he also supported him better in that character than anyone else we bare seen play with him. The two rival actors hunt very well in couple. One thing which we did not expect, and w hich we think reconciled us to Mr. Booth’s imitations, was, that they are here performed in the presence, and as it were with the permission of Mr. Kean. There is no fear of deception in the case. The original is ther^ in person to answer for his identity, and “ give the world assurance of himself.” The original and the copy go together, like the substance and the shadow. But then there neither is nor can be any idea of competition, and so far we are satisfied. In fact, Mr. Booth’s logo was a very close and spirited repetition of Mr. Kean’s manner of doing lhat part. It was indeed the most spirited copy we ever saw upon the stage, considering at the same time the scrupulous exactness with which he adhered to his model in the most trifling viinulidc. We need only mention as instances of similarity in the bye-play, Mr. Booth's mode t of delivering the lines, “ My wit comes from my brains like birdlime,” or his significant and we think improper pointing to the dead bodies, as he goes out in the last scene. The same remarks apply to his delivery that we made last week. He has two voices, one his own and the other Mr. Kean’s. His delineation of lago is more bustling and animated. Mr. Kean’s is more close and cool. We suspect that Mr. Booth is not only a professed and deliberate imitator of Mr. Kean, but that hedias in general the c.ime-leon quality (we do not mean that of living upon air, as the Covent-Garden Managers supposed, but) of reflecting all objects that come in contact with him. We occasionally caught the mellow tones of Mr. Macreadv rising out of the thorough-bass of Mr. Kean’s guttural emphasis, and the flaunting, degagé robe of Mr. Young’s oriental manner, flying off from the tight vest and tunic of the little “ bony prizor” of the Drury-lane Theatre. The house was crowded fo excess at an early hour, and the play was given out with every mark of approbation for Saturday (last night).—Of Mr. Kean’s Othello we have not room to speak as it deserves, nor have we the power if we had the room. It is beyond all praise. Any one who has not seen him in tbe third act of Othello (and seen him near) cannot have an idea of perfect tragic acting.	-

Drury-Lake.-—A Miss Smithson made her first appearance at this theatre on Tuesday, in the character of Letitia Hardy, in the Belle’s Stratagem. This young lady's figure is much in her favour, her countenance is handsome, and her manner by no means defective in grace. Throughout the whole of her performance she w as most flatteringly received, and, on the whole, in the technical language of the theatre, may be said 10 have made a hit. In the broad comic part she displayed a vulgarity and bold humour which, although to fastidious critics they may appear to have been overacted, seem to us to be perfectly consistent with the spirit and aim of the author. Miss Smithson will be an acquisition to the theatre; and, as she becomes more familiar with the audience, will grow in public reputation. Mrs. Robinson’s Lady Tuuchwod was scarcely equal to that of Mrs. Orgf.r ; and Stanley’s Doricourt docs not claim much approbation at our hands.

THE DRAMA.
Drury-Lane.-—A new Melo-Drama was produced at! this Theatre on Tuesday, under the promising title of “ The Turret Clock” which, like all other of our dramatic | productions of later days, is a plagiary on some French pieces. It possesses, in fact, much of the French character, being a compound of sprightliness and abbsurdity, without a mixture of plot or powerful sentiment to enable it to bear the “ chains of definitions,” or the knife of criticism. The story is as follows:—
Mrmtrarcrs, a young English officer (performed by Mr. Pen-ley), is in love with Ntrinu (Miss I vers) the daughter of a.Spanish Don, of great wealth and influence. An elopement is agreed upon between the parties, and the hour fixed when the ■fair fugitive is to quit her father's house, and confide in the love and honour of a soldier. There is, however, another suitor in the play. Dm Alcara (Mr. R. Phillips), a wealthy Noble, advanced’ in years, is expected every moment, and he has her father’s approbation. But there is still another obstacle between our lovers and success. A band of robbers infest tbc neighbourhood; and while Mtmtnmif is on his way to keep his appointment, he rescues a stranger from their violence by his bravery; this stranger proves to be his own rival. After mueh persuasion, he enters his lover’s house, with his rival and her father, a few moments before she makes her escape, as was previously concerted. While they converse the turret clock strikes. Nerhia is missed, and her father offers to grant any reward that may be named by the person fortunate enough to find her. Mentravers rushes out in pursuit. In the meanwhile Nerma is encountered by the robbers, who take from her a precious necklace^ after which they abandon her in a wood. Here she meets with a shepherd travelling to the next village, to hire as a servant with the widow of the Alcalde lately deceased. She purchase“ from him the clothes he had provided for the occasion, and thus equipped sets forward to the same destination, The arrival in the village is marked by an exraordinary circumstance. The people want a new Alcalde; no candidate for the office appears, and by a local custom it is provided that under those circumstances the first stranger who arrives is compelled to accept the office. Nerma is the first who arrives. While these events are in progress, J/<m-Iracers meets the robber who had plundered the necklace of his beloved; he recognizes the property, and supposing her to have been murdered by the villain, encounters him in single combat, conquers him, and leaves him for dead. He is seized immediately, by the officers of justice, for the act, and brought to answer it before the new appointed Alcalde. His Mistress is of course a lenient and partial Judge, hut her arguments fail to release him until the supposed murdered person is brought into Court, charged with another robbery. The father makes his appearance at the same time. She throws off her disguise, a -knowledges her sex, implores her father, embraces her lover, a .d is married with all the expedition that characterizes that ceremony on the stage.
This piece went off- in a flat manner; it may drag- on existence for a few nights, and will doubtless then pass into oblivion, and leave no vestige behind.

A message from the Bulbul bears—

Dauntless he stood—’tis come—soon past—

Despair benumbed her.	Canto 2, line 505.
SCENE 10.
The Dervise at the C’heiftain’s Feast.

THE DRAMA.	‘	; .
tHronv-LANE.—last night the Tragedy of Othello was enacted at this Theetre ; and if the Man-.jrement would only bring the strength of their House forward In Tragedy as well as «Comedy, their Theatre would fill mueh better and tie public be more rationally amused than it inis hi'hCrto been. It. is of little consequence to have one superior actor in a piece— every part hinges upon the other; and the excellence df ■ re only serves to give adarker contrast to theothor. .TheTheatre, beside, is not intended to be made tbc.a-.te^aoh'ielii-of trrm peting the fame of any single indivtcu.l, however exalted ti.htr he or she ntay be. It is intended to instruct and ¡o an, use ; and neither can be eti-cted by tire exertions of any one performer. Contrast and collision heighten the,beaut es of T a-tnre, and not one ineu .tain forest, or one daisied v.Iey. ft" we look to the arrangements aad combination of mind, v e cap discover that in the collision the highest int, ikctr.nl be antics are to be found; not in any one isolated faculty and power, however great and astonishing it may be.
The “Management” here last night afforded u- an opportunity of thanking them, for the first time during tie si maty months. W e have seen Mr. Maywood nud Mr. K tax, and Mrs. KoBitisoN in the same interesting,Tragedy. The generous Othello was never more ably or succestfully delineated In n by Mr. Kean; nor the revengeiul, sly, and hypocritical v"’lain logo, more admiraoly represented tiian bv air. Maywood. The gentle Dtedemoua had a very feminine representative ip Mrs. Kobis ion-and Cattio and Roderigo any thing bat badly given—although they might be better. We know not why it is that Mr. Kean and Mr. Maywood do not oftener play together. Kean has fire; Maywood strength and solidity af judgement; Kean appeals to the heart;—and. Maywood fills the understanding. Kean sometimes borrows some of the simplicity of Maywood; and Maywood neverfaik of catching seme of the inspiration of Kean. Each serves the other—not only by collision, bnt by contrast; and ciir astonishment is that vre are not oftener gratified by seeing them exerti g their commanding talents in the same piece, it is by urging merit forward— by pressing talent into tbeir service, that the Managers of Druiy Dane can expect to have their Theatre flourish. And if they produce sterling pieces in Tragedy or Comedy ; and cast the 1 parts as they have done lastnight; it they discard all shew and pa’ geantry and similar stud ; they will soon increase their treasury, and successfully coutend with their present more fortunate rival.
1 —We need only in conclusion stale, that Mr. Maywood was I received with three distinct rounds of applause, and continued to be warmly appUmied to the conclusion of the play; that Mr. Kean throughout the whole performance obtained those especial murks of public favour which his performance of Othello must at all times command. We wish lie would impart some greater share of confidence into the general acting of Mr. Maywood; for vve can only attribute to an ex.ces.yve and dangerous pmidiiv, that want of rounding which is" visible -in the delneations of that Gentleman. The Pit was crowded; and the other parts of the House, considering the inclemency of the evening, very respectably attemieu.
On Thursday evening last, the public were fnriy gratified by the re-appearance of a favorite actress, whose latests have been allowed for a considerable lime to remain in lamented seclusion; we are perfectly unable to imagine the influence so hostile to the interests of this theatre, which has thus long deprived the public of the approved and excellent capabilities of Mrs. Davison; nor were we ever more delighted than to V it ness the on-dissenting suffrage of an audience in its tributary applauses on the appearance of that lady is tbc farce of the Midnight flour. On the entrance of Mrs. Davison there was an immediate and nnanimoos burst of approbation from every part of the bouse, which continued for many minutes. We were highly gratified at the evidence, of public constancy to its admired servants, and are happy to hail in the management or Drnry-Lane a dawning Influence which promises to conciliate the friends of the drama, and to found its pretensions to favor on the infallible method of presenting to their view lhe meritorious objects of accredited ability.	.

Drury Lane.—The Comedy of “ Know ,,0nr I own mind,” w as the performance at this Theatre, ' last Tuesday evening. The principal characters were exceedingly well sustained. Mrs. A lsor represented lady Bell, with great force and spirit. She sang, or rather acted two songs, in a most pleasing and characteristic manner, and was encored in one. The occasional departure from a certain tone of high breeding, which in strictness belongs to the part, was amply compensated l»v her vivacity. Mr. Harley was excellent in Dash-wood, as indeed he is in every character that comes within the rauge of his peculiar talents. Mr. Rae I ,was Mtllamour, and made that part very interesting, by the judicious and gentlemanly stvle in which he performed it. The Beggars Open,, had been announced for that evening, but was postponed, in consequence of the indisposition of Miss Byrne’. .
