THEATRE,..........DONCASTER.
First Night of the New Historical Drama of JOHN OVERY.
This present Tuesday, Oct. 5, 1830,
Will he performed, for the first time, the popular Historical Drama, written by D. Jkrrold, Esq. Author of Black*
Eyed Susan, <5fc. and now performing with the greatest success at the Metropolitan Theatres, entitled
JOHN OVERY
The Miser of Southwark Ferry*
There is a biographical fragment of John Ovrrv to be found in Pennant’s History of London. John Overy (or Overs, as he is in some places called) lived about the eleventh century, and rented the ferry of Southwark, before a bridge was built across the Thames. He was a w.onder of penuriousneM, and eventually owed his death to his passion for gain ; for believing that should he	•
counterfeit death, his apprentices would forego their customary sennt provisions for the day, he suffered himself to be laid out as one jfcn hind departed this life. His apprentices, however, rejoicing at the demise of the master, assailed the cupboard, when Overy arogf, ang one of his men mistaking his master for a speere, struck at him with the butt-end of an oar, and killed him on the spot. fTjfWt the above circumstances the interesting Drama of John Overy is founded—the conduct and catastrophe of which inculcate that most impressive and moral lesson, the awful effects of the degrading vice of avarice, which in the conclusion ef the piece receives the punishment a passion so evil justly merits.

PROGRAMME OF THE PRINCIPAL INCIDENTS AND SCENERY.
The Wizard Oceano, surnamed the Old Man of the Sea, having sworn to the Demon of the Red Sea to immolate a human victim upon his altar at every change of the Moon, is thereby enabled to subdue Parazaitle, the Fairy uf the Enchanted Islands, and confining her for ever in a crystal vase, reigns undisputed Lord of the Island, practising every cruelty upon the unfortunate travellers who land upon its shores. An English vessel is \vrecked upon the island, and all on board perish with the exception of Marian, who	falls into the Wizurd’s power. — Enamoured of	the	Girl,	Oceano wishes to
preserve her life, and is anxiously seeking for another victim whom he may	sacrifice upon the altar of the	Demon of the	Red Sea,	when Sinbad falls
into his power. At this time the Pantomime commences, and the stage represents
A ROMANTIC VIEW ON THE SHORES OF THE ENCHANTED ISLANDS Sinbad h discovered sleeping, and awakes just in lime to be too late, tor he	perceives the vessel in which	lie had visited	the	total	coast leaving the
Island. Abandoned by his companions, the unlucky	mariner falls into the power of	Oreatio, and is	led	to
THE MYSTIC CAVERN OF THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA.
Here the Wizard, aided by the Monster Malico, chains the unhappy Sinbad to a rock, and is endeavouring to prevail upon the captive Marian ta listen
to his suit, when he i> reminded by
THE DEMON OP THE CRIMSON SEA
That tha moment approaches when he must render up the stipulated victim, or the Fairy Parazaide will regain her liberty, Oceano determines tha
Sinbad shall perish ; but fading in his foul design,	•
THE FAIRY OF THE ENCHANTED ISLAND ESCAPES FROM THE MAGIC VASE,
And transforming the unhappy prisoners into the motley Hero and Heroine oi Pamominie, aids thi ir escape irom the Enchanted Island. The Demon of the Red Sea, reluctant to lose his victims, changes Oceano and Malico into the slippered Pantaloon and fantastic Clown, dispatching them in pursuit of the Lovers.—The view holloo is given—the game is started and Harlequin breaking cover.

OF THE THEATRE ROYAL, COYEIT6AKDM,
Written with a view of displaying his Extraordinary Powers, and embracing the Principal Characters so enthusiastically pourtrayed by him in London, Dublin
and Edinburgh ;
The First of which will take place on Monday Evening, March 1, 1841.
As the African Roscius is the only Actor of Colour that was ever known, and probably the only instance that will ever again occur ; and having been acknowledged by the united Press of England, Ireland, Scotland, and America, to possess Histriomo Talent of the highest order, the following Sketch of his Life may not' be unacceptable:—	I
The ancestors of the African, down to the Grandfather of the subject of this Memoir, were Princes of the Foulah Tribe, whose dominions were Senegal, on the banks of the Gambia. The Father of the present individual was sent to Schenectady College, near New York, in the United States. Three days after his departure from hi* native shore, an insurrection broke out amongst the tribe, arising chiefly from a wish on the part of the King to exchange Prisoners taken in battle, < instend of adopting the usual barbarous custom of selling them for slaves. His humanity, however, interfered with an established perquisite long possessed by some' of his principal Officers,—the Grandfather of the present Roscius, through theirointerested policy, fell a victim to his mutinous subjects, Deprived of the means of asserting his birth right, and, in a certain degree, cast upon the world as a cosmopolite, the Father became a Clergyman, and officiates in New York. The subject of this memoir was horn July 24, 1807 ; was destined for the same profession, but preferring the sock and buskin, he departed from his father's roof, and wended to the shores of Old England.	1

Or Three-fingered Jack.
The incidents of this Drama are founded upon facts. The Obi, or Three-fingered Jack, having excited in the island of St. Domingo, viw. a rebellious slave, who flying from the service of his master, betook himself to the woods and recesses of the island, where congregating together a hand of natives, kept the whole colony in terror by his dreadful murders and robberies, strengthened by a prevalent belief tLat bis life was unassailable by a charm, which he constantly carried about him, and known by the name ofObi. The appellation of Three-fingered Jack arose from his having lost in one of his sanguinary conflicts two of the fingers of his right hand. At length, after various futile attempts at his capture, he fell beneath the art and prowess of two emancipated negroes, named Sam and Quashee, who severed his head from his body, and carried it in triumph to the city. This drama of action has ever been considered as one of the most powerful and interesting of the pantomimic grade represented.

Blau, In the most liberal manner, panted him the Theatre for OfS NIGHT,

In order that he may have the opportunity of meeting his numerous I,iter a ry, Theatrical, and Sporting Friend«, who will give him their

Will have the honour, for One Night Only, of most respectfully making his bow before a Dover Audience, in tbe character of
BOB LOGIC:
In accordance with the idea, that one good turn deserves another—the Managers all over the United Kingdom; America; East and West Indies, See. having made use of his Book to their advantage, he humbly trusts that be may turn over “ a new Leaf,” of his own work, with a “ tiny bit’’ of advantage to himself—and “ no mistake.”—Vineit Veritas:- -The London Courier, on Monday, October 14, 1839, in speaking of the Origin of the Adelphi Theatre—observes, that during the run of Tom and Jerry at this place of ainuseme.nt. for two seasons—tne PTupiletwi., M««,. HOD\V F.I.I, and JONES, cleared TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS!'! But the Act of Parliament for the protection of the rights of Dramatic Authors at that period did not exist.—or else- -the Author might not have appealed to the Public !
THE MINDS Bye on the plestftiiiff Subject.
It has been observed by the O AY -eft of the Poets that “ LIFF.’S a jest! and all things shew it.” lie it so; therefore any thing like a jolte, upon the present occasion will not be termed out of place, that
“THE RIGHT END OF LIFE, IS TO LIVE AND BE JOLLY!”
x “ The man that hath not music in his soul!” But no matter—-the late Lord Chancellor Erskine facetiously observed on the Bench, that
t( A little mirth in this melancholy Life is a good thing I”
Excellent advice ! good law ! and gratuitous ¡nto the bargain ! think of that Master BROOKE!—*Hem !—Shakspearb! but
THE PLAY’S TME THING!
To he sure it is—but what’s the argument, my Lord ? A CUKE TOR THE HEART ACHE l Invaluable recipe 1 I would purchase it at aiiy price. Would you my worthy soul ? Come then ami join the merry throng, if you wish to have a prime night of it—“ the best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical pastoral, socne-individable, or poem unlimited, Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light.” Yes, iudeed, these are the creatures for not only getting the best of the BLUE DEVILS ! but positively rwetting the auditors to the spot—«¡pet¿-bound as it were; exit Grief and Melancholy in "their presence—enter Fun, Frolic, and Laughter. ^ 7etnpus Eugit! “ Fly
Life and Character in every point of view The greatest exer tions will he made to render the Evening’s Entertainment complete—in hopes to obtain the Praise and exclamation from all parties, according to the dramatist, of one of—“ The Happtkst Days of My Life! '
The Sporting Friends of Pierce Egan have offered to back him at high odds, that his leather has never written an offensive won! against order mid propriety; but hia pen has been devoted to promote mirth, increase fun, and make Mankind happy and merry : and also, that he can take the ** flattering auction” to himself, that he has vent thousands and thousands, of his Majesty’s Subjects in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, Ac; laughing hoartily to their Beds; therefore, he trusts his numerous kind patrons will not take it amis»—that he hopes he may be able to join cordially in the laughter on the above evening.

FOR THE

OF
Mr. Ge«. Jeffery,
STAGE KEEPER.
-----------------=<5>	-----
On Monday Evening, Dec. 22nd, 1834,
W ill be performed, tbe interesting Play, founded on a circumstance which occurred in this County, called
<&IBiDI2£r
Of Faversham.
Arden...Mr. CRESWICK.
Mosby.Mr. BARRATT.	Franklin.Mr. FAUCITT.

Black Will. .Mr. BYFIELD.	Sbakebag. .Mr. JEFFERY.	The Mayor. .Mr. CRISP.
Mrs. Arden.... Mrs. BARK ATT.	Anna.... Miss STOKER.
This Play is founded on a fact which took place at Faver»ham, in the County of Kent, in the reign of Edward VI. and was adapted to the Stage by Lilo, and performed upwards of 200 Nights at the Theatres Royal, Drury Lane and Covent Garden. To write any eulogium on the merits of the Piece would be superfluous,—guflice it to say, it should be seen by every Fattier, Mother, Son, and Daughter, from the Palace to the Cottage. The circumstance of Mrs. Arden being tied to a stake and burnt, in a field near Canterbury, for the Murder of her Husband, proves that crime sooner or later will meet with its just reward.
'	IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING,
Several Comic Songs by Mr. JEFFERY,
Songs by Mr. FRANKS, & Songs by Mrs. ANGELL.

Fatima.. .. Mrs. ANGELL.	Irenes;. Miss STOKER.	Bedar.... Mrs. PUGH.
This Melo Drama is taken from one of the Stories contained in the well-known Eastern Tales of “The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments.” Blue Beard is smitten with Fatima, the Daughter ol Ibrahim; and who, by her Father's consent, is borne to the Castle of the Tyrant, in opposition to her own and a faithful Lover's (Selim) wishes. There all the splendour of the East is lavished by Blue Beard to make her happy, but in vain. The Tyrant leaves her free to examine the Palace, during his absence, with a strict injunction not to enter the BLUE CHAMBER; but female curiosity, alas, prevails; and at the request of her Sister (Irene), who accompanies her in her search, she opens the Door of the Apartment; when, instantly, the Key (a magic one) falls to tlm ground, and to their horror they behold A SKELETON, under which is written “ PUNISHMENT OF FEMALE CURIOSITY 1” Blue Beard returns and demands the Keys,—she gives them all but the one of the fatal Chamber,—he insists on having it, when on its being produced, he discovers that she has disobeyed his orders, and condemns her to INSTANT DEATH 1 At that moment, wi.de dragging her from the Turret, Selim arrives with a party of Soldiers, FORCES THE TYRANT’S CASTLE, saves Fatima, and the Piece concludes with the DEATH OF IHF, TYRANT.

LISEITE, the Wife of voith g Cartonch, a Serjeant in tB* French Service, has been detained by a dangerous illness in Spain. Partially recovered, she is on her way to join her husband, when she is attacked by a Freebooter, from whose power she is rescued by the bravery of a veteran Soldier, who ultimately proves to be the father of her husband. The Seijeant’s Wife and her aged Protector stop for tbe night at the old Chateau, inhabited by Dennis and Gaspard. Here Lisette’s suspicions are first aroused, and afterwards dreadfully confirmed, by tbe friendly warning of Margot, the female attendant In short, Dennis and Gaspard have resolved to murder their guest for the sake of tbe property in his knapsack. The old Soldier’s chamber is divided only by a slight partition from that of Lisette, who, in an agony of horror, listens to the movements of the murderers round their victim's bed. Their intentions are happily frustrated by the arrival of some Strangers at the gate. Old Cartouch quits tbe bouse, leaving his knapsack behind biro. Dennis suspecting that the Serjeant’s Wife has overheard their proceedings, interrogates her closely—bis fears prove true—he attempts her life, but by her heroic intrepidity she avoids the peril. In the mean time old Cartooch, with Frederick and a party of Soldiers, arrive—the murderers are secured, and the Seijeant’s Wife is restored to the arms of her husband.

They proceed in solemn Procession to the Fatal Spot!

The whole to conclude with the MELO DRAMA of The
Gambler’s Life;
Oil, THE HUT OE THU RED MOEHTAH.	v
This Melo-Drama holds forth a lesson of deép importance to the Titled Gambler, who stakes his thousands down to the meanest wretch that ever Gambling made its Victim.
“ Murder most foul, as in the best it is ;
“ But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.”
The incidents, though highly romantic, are nevertheless probable; indeed, many of them would appear the natural results of his headstrong career. Other spectacles, founded on impossibilities, may delight the eye, and leave untouched the heart; but this strikes the very heart’s core, and presents to the terrified imagination such an appalling picture of infamy, destitution, and despair, that we unhesitatingly pronounce much benefit must result to .society from its exhibition.

OF THE lOth. DEPOT,
THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE CELEBRATED
(From the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, Theatres, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, £f c.) known as the first
JUVENILE ACTRESS OF THE DAY,
And who was presented, Six Years ago, before she left England, and after her performance of Richard 111., with the late KEAN’S HAT, and lately by the Citizens of New York, with a splendid GOLD "WATCH AND CHAIN,11S tributes to her Talent-
Mr. Davenport has the honor of announcing to the Nobility, Gentry, and Public of Dover, that, induced by the Dwelling House attached to the Theatre—the elegance of the latter and the quick conveyance to and from London, he has taken for a limited period the Theatre; with the wish ofbcconiing a permanent resident if it should answer his purpose (although the Season would only then be Four Months in the Year); but lie regrets to state that since his arrival he has found thut'the Theatre lor the last two or three \~ears has been in the hands of persons who were totally ignorant of their business, and destitute alike of talent and respectability. Mr. Davenport feels, under such circumstances, that he has a delicate task in addressing the Public in his first Bill—he cannot say that the Pieces will be produced with the greatest care—that the House is thoroughly purified with soap and water from Gallery to Cellar—that Shakespeare’s Plays, when announced, will be acted in unison with tin* text, following as far as space will allow, the example of Drury Lane this last Season—He cannot gravely assert all this, because so many fallacious statements have been made to the Public, that he stands the chance of being classed with those who have gone before, and disbelieved ; however, Miss Davenport's name will, he respectfully trusts, be a guarantee to the Public that there is an attempt to be made to place the Drama in this Town upon higher ground, and with the aid of a respectable company, to render the Theatre a place of instruction, as well as amiMcment, and also a subject of credit and attraction to both the resident inhabitants and visitors. In this attempt Mr. Davenport calculates upon the intelligence of an enlightened community, and relies upon them for support.
On Monday Evening, August 14, 1843,
Will be presented, Shakespeare’s admired Tragedy of

To give an idea of the effect produced by Miss Davenport’s performance of this Dumb Orphan, is impossible. At New York it was so intense, that the auditors, excited by their feelings, simultaneously arose Pit, Boxes,and l Gallery, and stood with the most breathless attention. After her description of deprivation o("speech through terror, occasioned by a lamb falling over a precipice—(in the attempts to save its life, the Dumb Boy was precipitated into the terrific gulf, — caught and suspended by the branch of a tree,) and the unfortunate victim of villainy, giving a summary of the appearance, manner, and minute acts of the murder of which be is accused— (lie audience gave vent to the excitement which prevailed, by several unanimous bursts of applause.

Mr. DAVENPORT, in announcing his BENEFI T and addressing the Public for the last time, takes the liberty of reverting to the Condition of the Dover Theatre when he entered upon its Management in August last. It was then at the very lowest ebb of reputation; so much so, that it was doubtful whether a respectable auditor would enter its walls. The property is again completely re-established, and how has this been accomplished ?—by a urcr sacrifice of monry and Miss DAVENPORT’S Time— these have been made cheerfully, and are merely now alluded to for the purpose of strengthening the Manager’s claims on the public, aud those interested in the welfare of this Theatre, for support on HIS BENEFIT, to which he naturally looks forward, if not to indemnify, at least as a mark of approval and stimulus to exertion, if in September next he should meet the Patrons of the Drama in Dover as the Superintendent of their Amusement, and with lively feelings of gratitude to those Ladies and Gentlemen of Dover and the Inhabitants generally who have supported him in his arduous struggle this season ; and with best wishes for the prosperity of this town, he most respectfully bids—FAREWELL!

ON MONDAY i:v	AtWtJST the S8th, 1N4S,
Will We presented the admired anil interesting DHAMA, called
To write an adequate panegyric upon the merits of this Piece is impossible; the very name excites emotions which the most callous heart cannot help feeling ; for whoever heard the simple word Hbme pronounced without acknowledging the plcasureable sensations, the early and fond recollections, which imperceptibly creep round the heart! The Duke Vivaldi, a wealthy and powerful nobleman, has decoved from home Clari, the daughter of Rolamo, au honest farmer, under a promise of marriage; and under (his promise he conveys her to his Palace at Venice, where, actuated by the basest motives, he recedes from his plighted faith ; and, under the semblance of love, urges his dishonourable suit to the lovely-partaker of his flight. Words cannot depict the agony of the confiding wanderer, when she discovers the villany of her base seducer; and no resource is Icf, her but to return to that home she had abandoned, and those parents whose heart she had almost broken. Here the interest of the piece is worked up to a climax, which further description would impair ; but to the young and old—to all classes of society—a useful lesson is held up, in which the punishment of the guilty, and the reward of the virtuous, are fully conspicuous. The simple air of “ Home,” the pathetic melody of which is interspersed through the Piece, gives a reality to the scene, and heightens the delight which every one must experience at thn representation of this unequalled Drama.	,
