more juttly, or more effectually exerted. The Crimes and Mufoiiuties of the unhappy George Barnwell,
»re held up as an awful Monitur to Youth ; and amongft other Inflaticcs of the great li lluente of Stage
Effect over the P.,flions, the following Anecdote is a lading Proof of its facinating Power, both tb Imptuve

compelled him to teplace the Money fo difgraccfully obtained, iind by * Life ot ftiiS Honor and Probity,

Will be prelented that admired, popular and attracting COMEDY of the

STRANGER.

This Play is a translation from the German Comedy of MISANTHROPY and REPEKTANCK, and is juftly allowed by all our critics, to be the mod linilhed piece ever offered
to the public : the parts of the STRANGER and Mrs. HALLER are exquifitely drawn,
and rfluft intercft every feeling breaft. In theSTKANOER we behold a Man pofleffed
of a benevolent hfeart, with feeling and humanity for his fellow creatures, yet, ^by the
hard ufage of the World, and the mifconduct of a beloved wife), thofe noble virtues are
clouded by Mifanthropy, The defcription of his wife's perfidy to his friend, he concludes
" with the hopes of finding reft in the world to come,—" O God, O God, there is another and
a belter not Id." In (hort the unbounded applaufe and diftinguif^f.d approbation this piece
has, and ftill continues to receive at the Drury lane Theatre, and every other Theatte in
the kingdom, convinces that it need only be feen to.be admired.

'lhe"celebrated Tragedy, of The

Larl 01 Lssex;
Or, the unhappy Favorite,
The tan's of the Audience, whenever thia excellent and very effecting Tragedy
is performed, abundantly manifests its Power over the He»rt.—The Author has
throughout the Piece strictly adhered to H i s r o . i C A i F A C T . -, it exhibits somenf
the roost striking and interesting Events that maikcd the Reign of Q U E E N
E L I Z A B E T H , particularly the Disgrace and Death of that distinguished NofcleinSn and unfortunate Favorite the E A R L of ESSEX. — The fifth Act is
worked up with more Art and Nature, and is more impressive and affecting in
its Termination, than any Flay which the English Stage has hitherto produced.
The keen disticscs of the unhappy Eatl, and the distraction of his amiable and
beloved Countess when summoned by the. Guards to Execution, are posvetful
Appeals to the Heart, and work up the feelings of the Spectator with iriesistiblf
Effect.

Our Bard to night, no doubtful story brings.
Of native Ornuine Enghih feats he sings:
Here no false varnish glitters to surpn-e.
Bat just H nt one Ttuimi in oidei rise;

And sure that Taitt must have for Britons charm?
That shews you Frame iiibdued by Mritish aims,

The ce>ebraiei T R A G E D Y of

Tancred '& Sigismunda.
Written by T H O M P S O N , .author of Th« Seasons, and esteemed the best Dramatic Preduftion of
that great Poet,
This moral and very affecting piece was firft brought out at Drury Lane, with unbounded apnlaufc,
and its success was insured by the appearance of Mr. Garnet and Mrs. Cibter, in the C harafters of Tattered
and Mgismundv, which they heightened and adorned with all the magic of their never failing art. It has
lately been revived for the SWi^ &»<t«.r, and generally allowed to be the best performance of that Theatric
Phenomenon.
The moving softness and defp romantic distress of the 1 ewers, are powerful appeals to
the heart, and cannot be seen by any person possessed of the least degree of sensibility without feeling
»U the emotions of tenderness and pity.
Learn hence, ye parents, who from nature stray,
And the great ties of soci.il life betray ,
Ne'er with your children aft a tyrants part,
T'is yours to guide, not violate the heart;
Keep virtues simple path before your eyes.
Not think from evil good can-ever' jive.

possessed of a benevolent hcuit. with f cling and humanity for hi. fellow creature., yet by the hard usage of the
world, and the misconduct of a beloved Wife, those noble virtue, are clouded by Misanthropy—the description of his
wife', perfidy to hi. friend, he concludes with the hopes offindingrest in the world to come; "OGod, OGod, there '
1. another and a better world!" in short, the unbounded applause and distinguished approbation this Piece las, and

SHAKSPEARE'S

celebrated Historical Play, called

Cymbeline,
K I N G OF B R I T A I N ;

Or, The Injured

Princess.

TTIIS Tragedy U bunded oa a period of time soon after the Romans became Masters of Britain; Shakspesre . . .
followed the history in those early ages pretty close. There is through the whole Play, a deal of bustle, plot and incident,
similar to the tine from whence it wua taken. The noble defence made by Potthumus, Bellarioa, Guiderius, and Arviragus, in s Grand Fight between the Romas* and Britons, who by their single valour turned the fortune of Battle, & pat
the Romans to flight, convinces us our ancestors were possessed of courage, (if not of dicipline) equal to those Masters of
the World, as they were then .tiled. Cytabelioe's discovery of his lost sons, who had been stolen from him and bred up
under the tuition of old Bellarius, gives a pleasing turn to the Piece, and Poathuuras's finding Imogen living, and innocent,
not only wind, up the Plot, agreeable to the rules of criticism, but must both affect and please a judicious Audieuce.

This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so ten/ beneficial to the rising Generation, WOS
founded on Fact: f'he unfortunate Hero of the Piece was etectttedfor the Murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, to whuk he was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned
woman* Step by step s/t*? led the unwary Youth to the !ast cruel Deed, which terminated a most miserable
Existence, by the most ignominious Death.
A Story is recorded, that a young Gentleman of the City of London, having embezzled Part of his Master's
Property, was providentially at a Representation of GEORGE BARNWELL*
at Drury-Lane* when that
admirable Actor Mr. Ross, personated the Character of George Barvwe'l. at whose Fate he was so struck,
that it occasioned his immediate Contrition and Reformation. The Gentleman so bentjiled by this excellent
Tragedy, was not ashamed to acknowledge his Obligations to the Play and the Performer* for at every sul)Seauent yearly benefit Mr. Ross received One Hundred Pounds sterting, with a Card to the following Effect.
'• Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable Representation of George Barnwell for more than Lift,
for his redeemed Honor and Credit* begs your Acceptance of the Inclosed, which Sum you will receive so long
as you continue in the Line of your Profession. Happy am I to acknowledge, that the Stage has prevented
me from Ruin and Disgrace. George Barnwtll stopped me in my Career, and saved me from an ignti'

Evening,

January

21*1, 1819.

Will be brought forward ( for the only time,) the Historical TRAGEDY

of,

RR1TJTO
Or,

The FALL

OF

TARQVIN.

* This Tragedy is founded on one of Ihe niosl striking events in Unman History. The Father anil the elder
Brother of Latitat Junius, were murdered nnd their wealth seized 00 by Tarquin, King of Rome
Luuus
Junius, to save himself froul (lie same fate, feigns to be an Idiot; he therefore is suffered to live as the ciol ofthe Court, and becomes the sport and derision of the King, his Sons, and the whole People. The melancholy
deaf, of his kinswoman Lucrelin, occasioned by the brutal violence of Sex t us Tarquin, the King's eldest »on,
induces him to throw off the .mask he so long had worn, and aided by Ibe Sybil Prophecy, '* A FOOL
SIKH' lil) SET ROM F, FH BE," rouses the people to bieak their rhains of Slavery, and expel the Tarquins;
which laid the foundation of Roman greatness, and eventually made them MASTERS OK T H E W O R L D .
Thr number of i\ivht* this 'tragedy has already been acted since its first representation, Dtcember the 3rd,
decidedly proves its RKtL MKRIT -Indeed such are its attractive poweut, that Dittry-Lane Theatre every time it
is performed, is crowded liy a ddighled and applauding Jttdience.

This celebrated Tragedy proved wonderfully attractive diiri:'!r lie last Season, at the Theatre-Royal Cores!
Garden, no Play since Pizarni having had so great a rim. ll .- Liken from an early point of Rowan HUtary,
While contending with the neighbouring Slate*, and liie Tyrany of the Deremvirates.
The Author has very judiciously portrayed the Manner, and t'ust'iina of the Roman, at that early reriod,
which combined with Hie well-known «tory of Virginius devoting his Daughter, to preserve her from the Tyrant
Appius Claudius, gives ample scope to deliniate the passions, and redden it with other incidents one uf tine m..at

VIRGINIUS;
or, The Downfall of the Decemvir ate.
This celebrated Tragedy proved wonderfully attractive during the last 8eae.ui, at the Theatre-Royal, CoveDt
Garden, no Play »ince Pizarro having had so grea! a run. It is taken from an early point of Roman History,
while contending with the neighbouring Slates, and the Tyrany of the Decemvirate.
The Author has very judiciously portrayed the Manners and Customs of the Roman!, at that early period,
which combined with the well-known story of Virginius devoting his Daughter, lo preseive her from the Tyrant
Appius Claudius, gives ample scope lo delink!.' the passions, and renders il with other incidents one of the most
interesting and attractive Tragedies the Singe cm) boast of.
