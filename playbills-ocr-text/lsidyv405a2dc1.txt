NOTE ON THE SUH.1ECT OF THE PLAY.
TBBBE arc two accounts of the Invention of Printing. One ascribes the discovery of the Art to Laurens
J-naoen Costar, a native of Haarlem ; the other, and most widely received, to John Gutenberg, a citi«enoCMenta
The former has found its warmest adherents in Holland ; the latter is vehemently maintained by the German,
against the Dutch.
The Authors of" The First Printer" have followed the Dutch story, which, while it appears to them to rest on
strong and reliable authority, presents points of dramatic effect, which are wanting in the more commonly received
account.
The leading supporter of the claims of Costar to be considered " The First Printer,' is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
antiquary, who, in his ' Batavia,' written before 1575, but not published till after his death, in 1588, quotes, on
this subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem, who died, more than eitrhtv veara
B yJ
•Id, in 1515.
Junius had this story from two Haarlemers of station and repute—Nicholas Gael and Quisyn Talesius—who
had it frotn the mouth of Cornelius himself; who repeated it to Junius independently, and in almost the same terms
The old bookbinder, they said, could never tell the tale without tears of rage and pity. Thus it ran— Cornelius*
in his youth, worked under Costar, the inventor, as he declared, of printing with moveable types. Among bis
fellow workmen was a certain John, who had shared the same bed with Cornelius. This John, taking advantage
of a Christmas night, when all were at their devotions, broke into the workshop, stole Costar's types, and, flying
with them to Mentz, set up the first press ever established in that city
If this story be true, it follows, frem the uncontested facts of the history of printing in Mentz, that this John
could have been no other than one of the Gutenbergs ; probably the eldest of the two brothers of that name. It
is upon this story that the play of " T h e First Printer" is founded.
The statue of Costar, with an inscription describing him as the true inventor of printing, was set up in Haarlem
as early as 1655; and centenary festivals in his honour, have been celebrated down to our own limes. His family
became extinct in Haarlem early in the last century.

Note NjV tlie Authors, 011 the Subject of the PltiV.
Ti'-ir. ;ire two accounts of the Invention of Prin'ing. One ascnb»s the discovery of tlif Art to Laurens
Iftl lo»tt Coster, a native of Haiirlem ; the oilier, and most widely received, to John Gutenberg, a citizen of Menta.
The former has foui.d its warmest adherents in Holland ; the latter is vehemently maintained by the Germans
against the Dutch.
'
The \u:hors of" The First Printer" have folio, t." the Dutch story, which, while it appears to thein to rest on
et'on^ tad reliable authoity, pres-nts points of dr ,i.t latie effect, which are wanting in the more commonly received
•recount.
The 'eading supporter of ,B<? claims of Cental to be considered '-The First Printer," is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
iin:iq- vy, who, ii, his ' Bat;>via written before l.".7->, but not published till after his death, in 1688, quotes, on
.this subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem, who died, more than eighty years
old, in 161.$,
Junius had this story from two Uaarlemers of station and repute—Nicholas Gael and Quisyn Talesius — who
had it from the mouth <>i Cornelius himself; who repeated it to Junius independently, and in almost the same terms.
The old b .okbinder, they said, could never tejl the tale without t ars of rage and pity. Thus it ran -Cornelius
in bis \outb, worked under Costar, the inventor, as he declared, of printing with moveable types. Among his
fellow "orkmen was a certain John, who had shared the same bed with Cornelius. This John, taking advantage
of a Christmas night, when all were at their devotions, broke into the workshop, stole Costar's types, and, flying
with fiem to Mentz, set up the first press ever established in that city
If this story be true, it follows, frem the uncontested facts of the history of printing in Mentz, that this John
could have been no other than one of the Gutenbergs ; probably the eldest of the two brothers of that name. It
is upon this'story that the play of " T h e First Printer'' is founded.
1 he statue of Costar, with an inscription describing him as the true inventor of printing, was set up in Haarlem
as eaily as 1655 ; and centenary festivals in his honour, have been celebrated down to our own limes. His family
been ma extinct in Haarlem early in the last century.

Note
by the Authors, on the Subject of ine BMav.
T H E . E are two accounts of the Invention of Printing. One ascribes the dn-covorv ol tin- Art to Laurent
Jansoon Costar, a native of Haarlem ; the other, and most widely received, to John Gutenberg, n eiti-eno'Menta,
The former has found its warmest adherents in Holland; the latter is vehemently maintained by the Oermani
against the Dutch.
The Authors of" The First Printer" have followed the Dutch story, which, while, it appear to them to rest on
strong and reliable authority, presents points of dramatic effect, which are wanting m the more .•ommonly received
account.
The leading supporter of the claims of Costar to be considered " The First Printer," is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
antiquary, who, in his ' Batavia,' written before 1575, but not published till after his death, in 1688, quotes, on
this subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem, -he died, more than eighty yean

Junius had this story from two Haarlemers of station and repute—Nicholas (Jm>l and Quisyn Tale.ius—who
had it from the mouth ot Cornelius himself; who repeated it to Junius independently, and in almost the same terms.
The old bookbinder, they said, could never tell,the tale without t^ars of rage and pity, finis it ran - Cornelius,
in his youth, worked under Costar, the inventor, as he declared, of printing with moveable types, \moug hi.fellow workmen was a certain John, who had shared the same bed with Cornelius. This John, taking advantage
of a Christmas night, when all were at their devotions, broke into the. workshop, stole Costar's types, and, flying
with them to Mentz, set up the first press ever established in that city
If this story be true, it follows, from the uncontested facts of the history of printing in Mentz, that this John
could have been no other than one of the Gutenbergs ; probably th
is upon this story that the play of " The First Printer " is founded.
The statue of Costar, with an inscription describing him as the true inventor of printing, was set up in Haarlem
as early as 1655 ; and centenary festivals in his honour, have been celebrated down to our own limes. His family
..cam, extinct in Haarlem early in the last century.

Note by the Authors, on the Subject of t„c i*!av.
THata-are two accounts of the Invention of Printing. One ascribes the discov, t'\ of the Art to Laurens
JMUO.D Costar, a native of Haarlem ; the other, and most widely received, to Jo-'ii Gutenberg, a < itizeno*'Menu.
The former has found its warmest adherents in Holland; the latter is vehemently m,ii.ii..in<-<l by the German*
against the Dutch.
.
The Authors of* The First Printer" have followed the Dutch story, which, while it appetrs to them to rest on
strong and reliable authority, presents points of dramatic effect, which ere wanting in the more commonly received
account.
The leading supporter of the claims of Costar to be considered "The First Printer,'' is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
antiquary, who, in his ' Batavia,' written before 1575, but not published till after .is death, in 1588, quotes, on
this subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem who died, more th in eighty yearn
•Id, in 1615.
.
Junius bad this story from two ilaarleiners of station and repute—Nicholas One. and Quisyn Talesius—w&o
bad it fro-n the mouth of Cornelius himself; who repeated it to Junius independent),, and in almost the same terras.
The old bookbinder, they said, could never tell the tale without tears of rage and pity. Thus it ran -Cornelius,
in his youth, worked under Costar, the inventor, as he declared, of printing with moveable types, \mong bis
fellow workmen was a certain John, who had shared the same bed with Cornelius. This John, taking advantage
of a Christmas night, when all were at their devotions, broke into the workshop, stole Costar's types, and, flying
with them to Mentz, set up the first press ever established in that city
If this story be true, it follows, frem the uncontested facts of the history of printing in Mentz, that this John
c o l d have been no other than one of the Gutenbergs ; probably the eldest of the two brothers of that name. It
i . upon this story that the play of " T h e First Printer" is founded.
The statue of Costar, with an inscription describing him as the true inventor of printing, was set up in Haarlem
as early as 1655; and centenary festivals in his honour, have been celebrated down to our own limes. His family
became extinct in Haarlem early in the last century.

P A S

THERE are two accounts of the Invention of Printrtig. One ascribes the discovery of the Art to Laurens
Jansoon Costar, a native of Haarlem ; the other, and most widely received, to John Gutenberg, a citi-enof Ment*.
The former has found its warmest adherents in Holland ; the latter is vehemently maintained by the Germans
against the Dutch.
The Authors of" The First Printer" have followed the Dutch story, which, while it appears to them to rest on

The leading supporter of the claims of Costar to be considered " The First Printer." is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
antiquary, who, in his ' Batavia,' written before 1575, but not published till after his death, in 1588, quotes, on
this subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem, who died, more than eighty yeati
old, in 1515.
Junius had this story from two Haarlemers of station and repute—Nicholas Gael and Quisyn Talesius—who

The old bookbinder, they said, could never tell the tale without tears of rage and pity. Thus it ran—Cornelius,

After which, ( 6 t i l T i m e ) a New and Original Play, in Three Acts, by TOM TAYLOR and
CHARLES READE, Esqrs., entitled

THV

H^IUSJ-T

JS. mmwj w I K S I

Note by t h e A u t h o r . , on the Subject Of the P l a y .
THERE are two accounts of the Invention of Printing. One ascribes the discovery of the Art to Laurens
Jansoon Costar, a native of Haarlem ; the other, and most widely received, to John Gutenberg, a citizen of Ments.
The former has found its warmest adherents in Holland ; the latter is vehemently maintained by the Germans
against the Dutch.
The Authors of" The First Printer" have followed the Dutch story, which, while it appears to them to rest on
strong and reliable authority, presents points of dramatic effect, which are wanting in the more commonly received
account.
The leading supporter of the claims of Costar to be considered " The First Printer," is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
antiquary, who, in his ' Batavia,' written before 1575, but not published till after his death, in 1588, quotes, on
this subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem, who died, more than eighty years
old, in 1515,
Junius had this story from two HaarJemers of station and repute—Nicholas Gael and Quisyn Talesius—wh.
had it from the mouth oi Cornelius himself; who repeated it to Junius independently, and in almost the tame terms.
The old bookbinder, they said, could never tell the fele without tears of rage and pity. Thus it ran —Cornelius,
in his youth, worked under Costar, the inventor, as he declared, of printing with moveable types. Among his
fellow workmen was a certain John, who had shared the same bed with Cornelius. This John, taking advantage
of a Christmas night, when all were at their devotions, broke into the workshop, stole Costar's types, and, lying
with them to Mentz, set up the first press ever established in that city
If this story be true, it follows, frem the uncontested facts of the history of printing in Mentz, that this John
could have been no other than one of the Gutenbergs ; probably the eldest of the two brothers of that name. It
is upon this story that the play of " The First Printer " is founded.
The statue of Costar, with an inscription describing him as the true inventor of printing, was set up in Haarlem
as early as 1655; and centenary festivals in his honour, have been celebrated down to our own times. His family
became extinct in Haarlem early in the last century.

Note by t h e Authors, on the Subject of the P l a y .
THI,«E are two accounts of the Invention of Printing. OM* ascribes the discovery of the Art to Laurens
Jansoon Costar, a native of Haarlem ; the other, and most widely received, to John Gutenberg, a citisenof Ment*.
The former has found its warmest adherents in Holland; the latter i, vehemently maintained by the Germans
against the Dutch.
The Authors of" The First Printer" have followed the Dutch story, which, while it appears to them to rest an
strong and reliable authority, presents points of dramatic effeot, whteli are wanting in the more commonly received
account.
The leading supporter of the claims of Costar to be considered'*'The First Printer,'' is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
antiquary, who, in his ' Batavia,' written before 1575, but not published till after his death, in 1688, quotes, on
this subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem, who died, more than eighty year,
old. in 1516.
Junius had this story from two Haarlemers of station and repute—Nicholas Gael and Quisyn Talesius—who
had it from the mouth oi Cornelius himself; who repeated it to Junius independently, and in almost the same terms.
The ojd bookbinder, they said, could never tell the tale without tears of rage and pity. Thus it ran—Cornelius,
in his youth, worked under Costar, the inventor, as he declared, of printing with moveable types. Among bis
bellow workmen was a certain John, who had shared the same bed with Cornelius. This John, taking advantage
of a Christmas night, when all were at their devotions, broke into the workshop, stole Costar's types, and, lying
with tbena to Mentz, set up the first press ever established in that city
If tfiis story be true, it follows, frem the uncontested facts of the history of printing in Mentz, that this John
could have been no other than one of the Gutenbergs ; probably the eldest of the two brothers of that name. It
is upon thi' story that the play of " The First Printer " is founded.
The I ttue of Costar, with an inscription describing him as the true inventor of printing, was set up in Haarlem
as early as 655 and centenary festivals in his honour, have been celebrated down to our own times. His family
became exffnet in Haarlem early in the last century.

Tlrl* Evening. T U E S D A Y , April S i b . 18&O.
Will be presented ( ! - . t h T i m e ) a New and Original Play, in Three Acts, by TOM TAYLOR and
CHARLES READE, Esqrs., entitled T H E

FIRST FRUITER
Note by the Authors, on the Subject of the P l a y .

THERE are two accounts of the Invention of Printing. O.« as.nb.s the discovery of the Art to Laurens
Jansoon Costar, a native of Haarlem ; the other, and most widely received, to John Gutenberg, a citizen of Menta.
The former has found its warmest adherents in Holland ; the latter is vehemently maintained by the German*
Against the Dutch.
The Authors of" The First Printer" have followed the Dutch story, which, while it appears to them to rest on
•strom> and reliable authority, presents points of dramatic effect, whieh are wanting in the more commonly received
aeewtnt.
The l.*dii.g supporter of the claims of Costar to be considered " The First Printer," is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
antiquary, who, in his ' Batavia,' written before 1576, but not published till after Ids death, in 1588, quotes, on
this subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem, who died, more than eighty y e n s
.Id, in 1515.
Junius had this story from two Haarlemers of station and repute—Nicholas Gael and Quisyn Talesius—who
had it from the mouth ol Cornelius himself; who repeated it to J.nius independently, and in almost the same terms.
T h . .Id bookbinder, they said, could never tell the tale without tears of rage and pity. Thus it ran — Cornelius,
in his youth, worked under Costar, the inventor, as he declared, of printing with moveable types, \mong his
fellow workmen was a certain John, who had shared the same bed with Cornelius. This John, taking advantage
of a Christmas night, when all were at their devotions, broke into the workshop, stole Costar's types, and, flying
with them to Mentz, set up the first press ever established in that city
If this story be true, it follows, frem the uncontested facts of the history of printing in Mentz, that this John
could have been no other than one of the Gutenbergs ; probably the eldest of the two brothers of that name. I t
is upon this story that the play of " The First Printer " is founded.
The statue of Costar, with an inscription describing him as the true inventor of printing, was set up in Haarlem
as early as 1655 ; and centenary festivals in his honour, have been celebrated down to our own times. His family
••came extinct in Haarlem early in the last century.

Colonel Paxxl,

Taaax are two accounts of the Invention of Printing. O a . as.nbes the discovery of the Art t o Lauren.
•Jaa.oou Co.tar, a native of Haarlem ; the other, and most widely receiver!, to John Gutenberg, a citiien of Menta.
The former has found its warmest adherents in Holland; the latter is vehemently maintained by the G.rman.
•gainst tii. Dutch.
The Authors of" The First Printer" have followed the Dutch »tory, which, while it appears to them to rest o .
atr.ng and reliable authority, present* points of dramatic effect, which are wanting in the more commonly receir.d
a..*ant.
The leading supporter of the claims of Cottar to be considered " The First Printer," is Adrian Junius, the Dutch
antiquary, who, in his ' fiatavia,' written before 1575, but not published till after his death, in 1688, quotes, on
t a n subject, the narrative of one Master Cornelius, a bookbinder, of Haarlem, who died, more than eighty Tear.
•hi. in 1616.
Junius had this story from two Haarlemers of station and repute—Nicholas Gael and Quisyn Tale.ius—who
_ad it from the mouth oi Cornelius himself; who repeated it to Junius independently, and in almost the same terms.
The old bookbinder, they said, could never tell the tale without tears of rage and pity. Thus it ran—Cornelias,
in his youth, worked under Costar, the inventor, as he declared, of printing with moveable types. Among h i .
fellow workmen was a certain John, who had shared the same bed with Cornelius. This John, taking advantage
of a Christmas night, when all were at their devotions, broke into the workshop, stole Costar's types, and, flying
with them to Mentz, set up the first press ever established in that city*
If this story be true, it follows, from the uncontested facts of the history of printing in Mentz, that this John
eonld have been no other than one of the Gutenbergs ; probably the eldest of the two brothers of that name. I t
M upon this story that the play of " The First Printer " is founded.
The statue of Costar, with an inscription describing him as the true inventor of printing, was set u p in Haarlem
a. early as 1655; and centenary festivals in his honour, have been celebrated down to our own limes. H i . family
— 1 extinct in Haarlem early in the last century.

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE WINTERS TALE

has constructed the charming drama of The Winter's Tale from Robert Green',
*' History of Dorastus and Fawnia," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
•tory by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five acts; inasmuch as reference is madetothe
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor*of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
•11 be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
The pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of the whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
fositioa in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
A D opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical em, and placing before the eyes of the
opectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, at a time when the
Rite flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
A-niRing that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, 1 feel that no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can now, alas! boast of nothing beyond its
•history and its ruins.
To connect the country known as ** Bohemia" with an age so remote, would he impossible: I
have therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmer, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
* e substitution of Bitkyma.
The difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre of
h y , while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresing period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors ih the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
t o both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
perpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of "Dionysia," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
a a d hit Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, ate first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the'evening before the intended departure of Polixenes
As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic Dance,
eo popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has- been attempted.
Later in the play, " T I M E , as CHORUS," has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. To carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in accordance with the character of the play as now represented,
MRS* been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CRONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of Luna and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
. f Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
The Theatre at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, as
i t is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings; and
att opportunity is thus affordedforthe introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
To give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by Dr. Burney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . Hatton has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
t h e ' ' H y m n ' ' which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved throughout;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
Interfering with toej|P*ural course of the action.
The archj$ea^r-"e£ portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most grat#f»l; a D a "»y thanks are peculiarly due to George Scbarf, Esq., Jun., F.S. A. (author of
t h e Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts at the Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. The vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to James A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for bis
valmable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
Thus, one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
orith many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
The favour extended by the public to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope
: my present attempt will be equally fortunate ; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark,
; although spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance
P i t h the subject and incidents of the play.
,
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
a---fc, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
R W stage alone, t o re-embody the past, trusting that the combination may be considered less an exhiS - a S o f I - B - - S - I l f | - - " | to the eye, than an ill-*tration of history addressed to the understanding,

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE WINTERS TALE

has constructed the charming drama of The Winters
Tale from Robert Green's
" History of Dorastus and Fawnia," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incident* of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to Hie
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and 1 have therefore thought it permissible to select a period w Inch, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
The pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of the whole fabric, 1 have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, nhen ut the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of the
spectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, ut a time when the
arts nourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world,
Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel that no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can now, alas! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
To connect the country known as " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: 1
have therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmer, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
the substitution of Bithynia.
The difference of name in no wav affects the incidents or metre of
t play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two laces that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs," I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the evening before the intended departure of Polixenes. As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
Later in the play, " T I M E , as CHORUS," has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. To carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CRONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of Luna and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
The Theatre at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, as
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting,
T o give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
great; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " H y m n to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by Dr. Burney, and other eminent Professors,
Mr. J . L. Hatton has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
the " Hymn" which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved throughout;
-v. thjf omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
The architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
#eel most grateful; and mv thanks are peculiarly due to George Scbarf, Esq., Jun., F.S. A. (author of
the Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts at the Crystal Palay/), from whom I have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. The vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to James A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer OR Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
Thus, one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
The favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance with the
subject and incidents of the play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
the stage alone, to re-embody the past, trusting that the combination may be considered less an exhibition of pageantry appealing to the eye, than an illustration of history addressed to the understanding.

I k l *.

has constructed the charming drama of The Winter'* Tale from Robert Green*.
" Hiitory of Dorastus and Fawnia," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of the play (as in the norel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five acts; inasmuch as reference is made to the
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accord*,
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
The pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of the whole fabric, I have adopted a period when

An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of the

Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel that no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h ,
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but wbiciKcan now, alas ! boast of nothing beyond it*
history and its ruins.
To connect the country known as "Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: I
have therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmer, in his annotatiobs on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bithynia.
The difference of name in no wav affects the incidents or metre of
the play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors hi the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for tlse
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and bis Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the evening before the intended departure of Polixenes
As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pytrkic Dmnce,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
Later in the play, " TUCK, as CHORUS," has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. To carry*
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CRONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of Luna and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
The Theatre at Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony of the trial of Queen Herinione, a*
it is know
mown that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally nov
novel and interesting.
To give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
great; nevertheless, using such authorities as wis possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo, which

THE WINTERS TALE

lv

™"&%%Z"T- { ^*Xm£r* B a r o n d e Gort-S,
Servant,

has constructed the charming drama of'TheWinter's Tale from Robert Green's
" History of Dorastus and Fawnia," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of tbe
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five acts; inasmuch as reference is made to the
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth centuryIt is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
alt be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
The pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of tbe whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before ibe eyes of tbe
spectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, at a time when the
arts flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
Assuming that tbe civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel that no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can now, alas! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
To connect the country known as " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: I
have therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmcr, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bithynia.
The difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre of
the play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leon.es
and his Queen Heimione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the evening before the intended departure of Polixenes
As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representalion of the celebrated Pyrrhic Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
Later in the play, " T I M E , as CHORUS," has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen vears, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. To carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now representee!,
has been, preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHKONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of Luna and the Stars fpersonified), sinking before the Car
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
The Theatre at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Herniione, as
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for tbe introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
To give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
great; nevertheless, using such authorities as w . possess,.including the " H y m n to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by Dr. Burney, and other eminent Professors,
Mr. J. L. Hatton has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
the " Hymn" which is played at the opening of tbe second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved throughout;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
,
The architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, beeh kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my wo~k,forwhich I
feel most gratcfnl; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., Jun., F.S. A. (author of
the Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts at the Crystal Palace), from whom I have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. The vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
1 also owe my acknowledgements to James A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music,for-his
valuable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
Thus, one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
The favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my pre*
sent attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance with the
subject and incidents of the play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
the stage alone, to re-embody the past, trusting that the combination may be considered less an exhibition of pageantry appealing to the eye, than an illustration of history addressed to the understanding.

After which, will be presented (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th & 18th Times) SHAKESPEARE's Play of Tr

S H A K E S P E A R E has constructed t h e charming drama ot The Winter's
Tale from Robert G r e e n ' ,
" History of Doi astus and F a w n i a , " and while he h a s sought to heighten and vary the interest of t h e
story by t h e introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of t h e play ( a s in t h e n o r e l )
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout t h e five acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter ot t h e sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with t h e spirit of t h e play, may he considered the most interesting, as well as t h e most instructive.
T h e pivot on which t h e story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident a s the corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, h a d , from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit of h e r political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, at a time when t h e
arts flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight a n d instruct t h e world.
Assuming t h a t the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, 1 feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
t o contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can now, alas ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect the country known as " B o h e m i a " with an a g e so remote, would be impossible: 1
have therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects t h e incidents o r metre of
the play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor a t a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
1 be Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between t h e two races that constitute t h e chief
actors in t h e drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to t h e season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for t h e
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm a n d extravagant merriment.
For t h e purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of t h e period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on t h e evening before t h e intended departure of Polixenes
A s dancing a n d music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, ha* been attempted.
L a t e r in the play, " T I M E , as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is tendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now representee!,.
has been preferred to t h e ordinary old man with his Scythe a n d hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHHONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured t o
associate him with an allegorical tableau ot L u n a and the Stars (personified), sinking before the C a r
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from an antique, o r
from the works of Flax man
T h e T h e a t r e at Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a s
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used tor legislative or judicial proceedings; a n d
an opportunity is thus afforded for t h e introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, a n endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to t h e
action. As all writers on t h e subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as w.; possess, including the " H y m n t o Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and t h e descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
Mr, J . L . Hatton has composed the overture, entrc-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
the " H y m n " which is played a t the opening of tlie second scene of the first act, during t h e progress
of the Banquet.
1 should not omit to state that t h e text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line suf.icing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of" the action.
T h e architectural portions of t h e play have, a s on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F . R S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
teel most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., J u n . , F . S . A. (author of
the Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts a t the Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many im«
..artant details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to James A . Davies, Esq , Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which h e has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope t h a t my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and 1 may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such a r e in accordance with t h e
subject and incidents of t h e play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by t h e united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong4o
the stage alone, to re-embody t h e p a s t , trusting t h a t t h e combination may be considered less an exhibition of pageantry appealing to the eye, than a n illustration of history addressed to the understanding.

PLAY OF*

THE WINTERS TALE

S H A K B S P K A R E has constructed t h e charming drama of The Winter's
Tale from Robert Green s
" History of Dorastus and F a w n i a , " and while h e has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by (he introduction of new characters, h e has left t h e incidents of t h e play ( a s in t h e novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to t h e time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout t h e five acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth w ith history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; a n d I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with t h e spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, a s well as the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which t h e story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident as t h e corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thueydides, h a d , from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior t o that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical e r a , and placing before t h e eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of t h e private and public life of the ancient Greeks, at a time when the
arts flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
Assuming that t h e civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious s o n s , " but which can now, a l a s ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
To connect the country known as ' ' B o h e m i a " with an age so remote, would be impossible : I
have therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
ky i hr substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in n o way affects the incidents or metre of
tin* play, while it enables me t o represent t h e costume of t h e inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding- period, associated so intimately with G r e e c e , and acquiring additional interest from close
proNiiiiitv to t h e Homeric kingdom of Troy.
i h e Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between t h e two races t h a t constitute the chief
,i' tors in t h e drama, while a t the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in t h e pastoral scene of t h e fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to t h e season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
purpose of n dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ^entured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
t h e title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while t h e actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm a n d extravagant merriment.
F o r the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy t h e domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen H e r m i o n e , together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on t h e evening before the intended departure of Polixenes.
A s dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, h a s been attempted.
L a t e r in t h e play, *' T I M E , as C H O R U S , " h a s been restored, in accordance with t h e poet's conception. B y this restoration, t h e lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as t h e shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred t o t h e ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. C H K O N O S , the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured t o
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and t h e Stars (personified), sinking before t h f Car
of Pheebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from t h e works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, as
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
a n opportunity is thus afforded for t h e introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate t h e music to t h e

many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed t h e overture, entre-actes, and incidental air., with t h e exception of
t h e " H y m n " which is played at t h e opening of the second scene of the t i n t act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should n o t omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has betn carefully preserved throughout;
t h e omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY

OF

THE WINTERS TALE

S H A K E S P E A R E h a s constructed t h e charming drama of The fWnter's
Tale from Robert Green*.
" History of D o i a s t u s and F a w n i a , " and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of t h e
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left t h e incidents of t h e play ( a s in t h e novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to t h e time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout t h e five a c t s , inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of t h e sixteenth century.
I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with t h e spirit of t h e play, may be considered t h e most interesting, as well as t h e most instructive.
T h e pivot on which t h e story revolves, is in fact t h e decision pronounced by t h e oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident as t h e corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, h a d , from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence t o a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, n h e n at the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before i h e eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of t h e private and public life of t h e ancient Greeks, a t a time when t h e
arts flourished to a perfection, t h e scattered vestiges of winch still delight and instruct t h e world.
Assuming that t h e civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
t o contemplate t h e manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious s o n s , " but which can n e w , a l a s ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect t h e country known as " B o h e m i a " with an age so remote, would he impossible: 1
have therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by t h e substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects t h e incidents or metre of
t h e play, while it enables me to represent t h e costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with G r e e c e , and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to t h e Homeric kingdom of Troy.
T h e Phrygian dres, presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while a t t h e same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in. t h e pastoral scene of t h e fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for t h e
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
S a t y r s . " I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
t h e title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while t h e actors indulged in m a d
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
F o r t h e purpose of presenting with closer accuracy t h e domestic manners of t h e period, Leontes
a n d his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, a r e first discovered towards t h e termination
of a Feast, on t h e evening before the intended departure of Polixenes.
As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of t h e celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout t h e principal states of Greece for its martial character, ha* been attempted.
L a t e r in the play, " T I M E , as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with t h e poet's conception. By this restoration, t h e lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
P e r d i t a until she is seen as t h e shepherdess in t h e fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out t h e idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with t h e character of the play as now represented,
h a s been preferred to t h e ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. C H R O N O S , the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured t o
.associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and t h e Stars (personified), sinking before the C a r
of Phoebus, which rises w.th all its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from a n antique, o r
from the works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e a t Syracuse h a s been selected for the ceremony of t h e trial of Queen Hermione, a s
at is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; a n d
an opportunity is thus afforded for t h e introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate t h e music to t h e
action. As all writers on t h e subject afford but meagre information, t h e difhculty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " H y m n to Apollo," which
m a n y consider genuine G r e . k , and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
t h e " H y m n " which is played a t the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of t h e Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with t h e natural course of the action.
T h e architectural portions of t h e play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most grateful; and my t h a n k s are peculiarly due to George Scbarf, E s q . , J u n . , F . S . A. ( a u t h o r of
the Handbook to t h e Greek and Pouipeian Courts a t t h e Crystal P a l a c e ) , from whom I have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many imp o r t a n t details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
t h e spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to J a m e s A . Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
-valuable aid in t h e department which he has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to t h e judgment of t h e public,
w i t h many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my pres e n t attempt will be equally f o r t u n a t e ; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it h a s only been where such a r e in accordance with t h e
subject and incidents of t h e play.
I have endeavoured, and 1 hope not altogether in vain, by t h e united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with t h e rapid movements and multiplied life which Belong to
t h e stage alone, to re-embody t h e past, trusting that the combination m a r be considered less a n exhibition of pageantry appealing to t h e eye, t h a n a n illustration of history addressed to t h e understanding*

T » e i discovered In.the S o u t hhof
e Italy).

To Commence at Two o'Clock—Doors open at Half-past One.

SHAKES:PEAK£ h a s constructed t h e charming drama of The Winter's
Tale from Robert Green's
" History of Dorastus and F a w n i a , " and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by t h e introduction of new characters, he has left t h e incidents of t h e play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date t o t h e time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout t h e five a c t s ; inasmuch as reference is made t o t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; a n d I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with t h e spirit of t h e play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident a s t h e corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior t o that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before t h e eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of t h e private and public life of the ancient Greeks, a t a time when t h e
arts flourished t o a perfection, t h e scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
Assuming that t h e civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those w h o wish
t o contemplate t h e manners a n d habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, a n d the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can now, alas ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect t h e country known a s " Bohemia" with a n age so remote, would be impossible i I
have therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by t h e substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects t h e incidents or metre of
t h e play, while it enables me to represent t h e costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor a t a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to t h e Homeric kingdom of Troy.
T h e Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the t w o races that constitute t h e chief
actors in the drama, while at t h e same time scope is afforded for t h e introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in t h e pastoral scene of t h e fourth a c t , where t h e festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-sheafing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for t h e
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured t o introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while t h e actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
F o r t h e purpose of presenting with closer accuracy t h e domestic manners of t h e period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards t h e termination
of a Feast, on t h e evening before the intended departure of Polixenes.
As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
L a t e r in t h e play, " T I M E , as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with t h e poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Ferdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out t h e idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with t h e character o f the play as now represented,
has been preferred to t h e ordinary old man with bis scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. C H R O N O S , the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and t h e Stars (personified), sinking before t h e C a r
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, o r
from t h e works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e a t Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony of t h e trial of Queen Hermione, as
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for t h e introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, t h e difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities a s we possess, including t h e " H y m n t o Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney. and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed the overture, entrc-actcs, and incidental airs, with the exception of
t h e ' ' H y m n " which is played at t h e opening of t h e second scene of t h e first act, during t h e progress
of t h e Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text o f Shakespeare has beer, carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with t h e natural course of the action.
T h e architectural portions of t h e pl.iy have, as on many former ocensions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which 1
feel most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, E s q . , J u n . , F . S . A. ( a u t h o r of
the Handbook to t h e Greek and Pompeian Courts a t (he Crystal P a l a c e ) , from whom I have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, nnd whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to J a m e s A . Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of t h e public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended t o my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it h a s only been where such a r e in accordance with tfce
subject and incidents of t h e play.

I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot

purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " w h o have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysi*,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged Jn mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
F o r the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen Fiermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on t h e evening before the intended departure of Polixenes.
A s dancing a n d music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, ha* been attempted.
L a t e r in t h e play, " T I M E , as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible
T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
bas been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. C H R O N O S , the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured t o
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and the Stars fpe'rsonified), sinking before the C a r
of Pluebus, which rises with ail its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from an antique, o r
from the works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e at Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a s
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for t h e introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, a n endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on t h e subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " H y m n to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed t h e overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
o f the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of t h e action.
T h e architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., B.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most gratefnl; and my thanks are peculiarly d u e to George Scharf, Esq., J u n . , F.S.A. ( a u t h o r of
t h e Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts a t t h e Crystal Palace), from whom I have received
t b e greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. T h e vegetation peculiar to fiithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE WINTER'S TALE

S H A K E S P E A R E has constructed t h e charming drama of The Winter's
Tale from Robert G r e e n ' .
" History of Dorastus and F a w n i a , " and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of t h e
story by t h e introductron of new characters, he has left t h e incidents of the play ( a s in the novel)
alternating between Sicily a n d Bohemia, without ussigniug any specific date to t h e time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five a c t s ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of t h e sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt ts made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and 1 have therefore thought it permissible to select a period w Inch, while it accords
with the spirit of t h e play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident a s the corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when a t the summit of her politicul prosperity.
A n opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, a n d placing before the eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, a t a time when t h e
a r t s flourished to a perfection, t h e scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct t h e world.
Assuming that t h e civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, 1 feel that no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious s o n s , " but which can new, a l a s ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect the country known as " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would he impossible: I
have therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by t h e substitatioii of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre of
t h e play, white it enables me to represent t h e costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor a t a con-f-ponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from clone
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute t h e chief
actors in the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in t h e pastoral scene of t h e fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for t h e
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have wade themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
S a t y r s . " 1 ha»« here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
t h e title of " ffionyxiu," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged i n m a d
ewtbwBiHsm a n d extravagant merriment.
For the put pose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of t h e period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kiugly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the evening before the intended departure of Polixenes
As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
L a t e r in the play, " T I M E , as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with t h e poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until s h e is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the hfea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHRONOS, the ancient representative of T i m e , has been chosen, and I have ventured t o
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and t h e Stars 'personifiedj, sinking before t h e C a r
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e at Syracuse h a s been selected lor the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a s
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; a n d
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, a n endeavour has been nuufe to assimilate the music to t h e
action. As all writers on the subject aflbrd but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " H y m n to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Barney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . I l a t t o n has composed the overture, entre-aetes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of the second scene of t h e first a c t , during the progress
of the Banquet.
1 should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of an occasional sentence or line suf icing to remove all prominent incongruities, without

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE WINTERS TALE

S H A K E S P E A R E lias constructed t h e charming drama of The tVintera
Tate from Robert Green's
" History of Dorastus and F a w n i a , " and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the

alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five a c t s ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e

It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot

T h e pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the.oracle of D e l p h i ;

T o connect the country known as '* Bohemia" with an a g e so remote, would be impossible: I
have therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of* Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in n o way affects the incidents o r metre of

•Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
t h e title of " Jfhnysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while t h e actors indulged in m a d
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes

By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed t o have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
o u t the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
h a s been preferred to t h e ordinary old man witl\ his scythe a n d hour glass, who was unknown in
classic a g e s . , CHHOHOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
o f Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from an antique, or
i'rom the works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e a t Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, as
i t is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
a n opportunity is thus afforded for t h e introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, a n endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " H y m n to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Rurney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed t h e overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of the second scene ol the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
T h e architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F . R . S . , who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most g r a t e f u l ; and my thanks are peculiarly due t o George Scharf, Esq., J u n . , F . S . A. ( a u t h o r -f
t h e Handbook t o the Greek and Pompeian Courts a t the Crystal P a l a c e ) , from whom I have received
t h e greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind h a s suggested many imp o r t a n t details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
t h e spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements t o J a m e s A . Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which h e has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of t h e public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended t o my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my pres e n t attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it h a s only been where such a r e in accordance ' w i t h t h e
subject and incidents of the play.
I have endeavoured, a n d " ! hppe n o t altogether in vain, by t h e united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong t o
t h e stage alone, to re-embody the past, trusting that the combination may be considered 1CM a n exhibition of pageantry appealing t o the eye, than a n illustration of history addressed t o t h e understanding.

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

TIE WINTERS TALE

S H A K E S P E A R E h a s constructed t h e charming d r a m a of The Winter's
lale from Robert Green*" History of Dorastus a n d F a w n i a , " and while he h a s sought to heighten and vary the interest of t h e
story by t h e introduction of new characters, b e h a s left trie incidents of t h e play ( a s in t h e novel")
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout t h e five acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an E m p e i o r o f Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and 1 have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with t h e spirit of t h e play, may be considered t h e most interesting, as well as the most instraclive.
T h e pivot on which t h e story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, 1 liave adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at t h e summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical e r a , and placing before t h e eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of t h e private and public life of t h e ancient Greeks, a t a time when t h e
arts nourished to a perfection, t h e scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct t h e world.
Assuming that t h e civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious s o n s , " but which can n e w , alas ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect t h e country known a s " Bohemia" with an a g e so remote, would be impossible. I
have therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir Thomas Haunter, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by t h e substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects t h e incidents o r metre of
t h e play, while it enables me to represent t h e costume of t h e inhabitants of Asia Minor a t a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to t h e Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between t h e two races that constitute the chief
actors in t h e drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for t h e introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in t h e pastoral scene o f t h e fourth a c t , where the festivities
applicable to the season nf sl.p«»p-et..»»«-.ng take place, and in which Shakespeare brings i n , for t h e
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Diony.ria," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm a n d extravagant merriment.
For t h e purpose of presenting with closer accuracy t h e domestic manners of t h e period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on t h e evening before t h e intended departure of Polixenes.
A s dancing a n d music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
L a t e r in the play, " T I M E , as C H O H U S , " has been restored, in accordance with t h e poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed t o have taken place from t h e birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the c h a r a c t e r of the play as now represented,
bas been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe a n d hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHBONOS, the ancient representative of Time, h a s been chosen, and I have ventured t o
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and t h e Stars (personified), sinking before t h e C a r
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxinan.
T h e T h e a t r e at Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony o f t h e trial of Queen Hermione, a s
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; a n d
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, a n endeavour has been made to assimilate t h e music to t h e
action. - As all writers on t h e subject afford but meagre information, t h e difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, i n c l u d i n g t h e " H y m n to Apolio," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . B u r n e y , and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed t h e overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of tire second scene of t h e first act, during t h e progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text ef Shakespeare h a s been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of an occasional sentence o r line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of t h e action.
The architectural portions of t h e play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F . R . S . , who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most grateful ; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., J u n . , F . S . A . ( a u t h o r of

t h e greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind h a s suggested many iuiuortant details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on

SHAKE*SPKAKK lias constructed the charming drama of The Winter't
Tale from Robert Green's
" History of .Dk.ra-ti.tl and Fatvnia," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictious abound throughout the five a c t s ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of t h e sixteenth century.
I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and 1 have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of t h e play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which t h e story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident as the corner"-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thncydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit ot her political prosperity.
A n opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of t h e
spectator, tableatuc vivunls of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, a t a time when the
a r t s flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel that no period could have,
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
t o contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious s o n s , " but which can now, a l a s ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect the country k n o w n a s " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: I
have therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by t h e substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre of
t h e play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
T h e Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute t h e chief
actors in the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for t h e
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves ail men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
t h e title of " Dioin/sia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of t h e period, Leontes
and his Queen H e r m i o n e , together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the evening before the intended departure of Polixenes.
A s dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
L a t e r in t h e play, * ' T J M E , as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with t h e poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. C H R O N O S , the ancient representative of T i m e , has been chosen, and I have ventured t o
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L n n a and the Stars (personified^), sinking before the C a r
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the woiks of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a s
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made t o assimilate the music to t h e
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " H y m n t o Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental ail's, with the exception ot
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of t h e Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has beer canefuJIy preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
T h e architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., J u n . , F . S . A. ( a u t h o r of
the Handbook to the Greek and Ponipeian Courts a t the Crystul P a l a c e ) , from whom I have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithyniu is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
t h e spot.
1 also owe my acknowledgements to J a m e s A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in t h e department which he has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted t o the judgment of t h e public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
•peetacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance with t h e
subject and incidents of t h e play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
t h e stage alone, to re-embody t h e past, trusting that the combination may be considered less an exhibition of pageantry appealing to t h e eye, than a n illustration of history addressed to t h e understanding.

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE WINTER'S TALI
S H A K E S P E A R E h a s constructed t h e charming drama of The Winter's
Tale from Robert Green*.
" History of Dorastus and F a w n i a , " and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of t h e
story by t h e introduction of new characters, h e has left t h e incidents of t h e play ( a s in t h e novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning a n y specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five a c t s ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot

position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
A n opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before t h e eyes of t h e

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY

OF

THE WINTERS TALE

S H A K E S P E A R E lias constructed the charming drama of Tke lVinte?s
Tale from Robert Green's
" History of Doiastus and F a w n i a , " and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the live acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to the
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and 1 have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may he considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of" D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of the whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of the
spectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, at a time when the
a r t s flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
t o contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can now, alas ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect the country known as " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: I
n . i r e therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre of
t b e play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on tbe evening before the intended departure of Polixenes.
As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
Later in the play, " T I M E , as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to tbe ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHRONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
of Phcebus, which m e s with all its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxinan.
The T h e a t r e at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, as
i t is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
To give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . h. H a t t o n has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception ot
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
The architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superntended by George Godwin, Esq., F . R . S . , who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which 1
feel most grateful ; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., Jun., F . S . A. (author ot
the Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts at the Crystal Palace), from whom I have received
t h e greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to J a m e s A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance with the
subject and incidents of the play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by t h e united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
t h e stage stone, to re-ethbody the past, trusting that the combination may be considered Less an «siiibition af payiitntry appealing to the eye, than an illustration of history addressed to the understanding.

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE WINTER'S TALE

has constructed the charming drama of Tke Winter's Tale from Robert Green's
" History of Dorastus and Fawnia," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five acts; inasmuch as reference is made to the
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accord,
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
The pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of the whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of the
spectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, at a time when the
arts flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel that no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can new, alas! boast of nothing beyond Its
history and its ruins.
To connect the country known as " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: I
n«vc therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmer, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the. substitution of Bithynia.
The difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre ot
the play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
I h e Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, ** who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen Ilermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the evening before the intended departure of Polixenes. As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
Later in the play, " T I M E , as CHORUS," has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed tc have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. To carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHKONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of Luna and the Stars ("personified), sinking before the Car
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
The Theatre at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Ilermione, as
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
To give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
great; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by Dr. Burney, and other eminent Professors,
Mr. J . L. Hatton has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of.
the " Hymn" which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved throughout;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
The architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superntended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scbarf, Esq., Jun., F.S. A. (author of
the Handbook to the Greek and Pompejan Courts at the Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. The vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to James A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music,forh i ,
valuable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
Thus, one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which 1 trust will not be considered inappropriate.
The favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope thatraypresent attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance with the
subject and incidents of the play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong io
the stage alone, to re-embody the past, trusting that the combination may be considered less an e-Wbition of pageantry appealing to the eye, than an illustration of history addressed to the understanding.

THE WINTERS TALE

HATH CHARMS.

S H A K E S P E A R E h a s constructed t h e charming drama of The Winter's
Tale from Robert Green*,
" History of Doras t us and F a w n i a , " and while h e has sought t o heighten and vary the interest of t h e
story by t h e introduction of new characters, h e has left t h e incidents of t h e play ( a s in t h e novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to t h e time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout t h e five acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and a n Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
I t is evident t h a t when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with t h e spirit of t h e play, may be considered t h e most interesting, as well a s the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which t h e story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident as t h e corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according t o Thucydides, h a d , from a mere D o r i c colony, increased in magnificence t o a
position in no way inferior to t h a t of Athens herself, when a t the summit of her political prosperity.
A n opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical e r a , and placing before t h e eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of t h e private and public life of t h e ancient Greeks, a t a time when t h e
a r t s flourished to a perfection, t h e scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct t h e world.
Assuming that t h e civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, 1 feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely t o give additional zest to those who wish
t o contemplate t h e manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which c a n new, alas ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect t h e country known as " Bohemia" with a n a g e so remote, wonld be impossible: I
H a r e therefore followed t h e suggestion of S i r Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by t h e substitution of Sithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects t h e incidents or metre o t
t h e play, while it enables me t o represent t h e costume of t h e inhabitants of Asia Minor a t a corresponding period, associated »o intimately with Greece, a n d acquiring additional interest from close
proximity t o the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
T h e Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in t h e drama, while a t t h e same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in t h e pastoral scene of t h e fourth act, where the festivities

t h e title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while t h e actors indulged in m a d

A s dancing a n d music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of t h e celebrated Pyrrhic

R I Robert
R I R R Greeti*— a - .
S H A K E S P E A R E lias constructed t h e charming —drama
of The Winter's
from
" History of Dorastus and F a w n i a , " and while h e has sought to heighten and vary the interest o f the
story by t h e introduction of new characters, b e has left the incidents of the play (as In the bevel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five a c t s ; inasmuch as reference is made to the
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with t h e spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well a s the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi ;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when a t the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, a t a time when the
a r t s flourished to a perfection, t h e scattered vestige, of which still delight and instruct t h e world.
Assuming t h a t the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely t o give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," bat which can now, a l a s ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect the country known a s ««Bohemia" with a n age so remote, would be impossible: I
n a v e therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in n o way affects the incidents or metre o t
the play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor a t a corresponding period, associated so intimately with G r e e c e , and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
T h e Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while a t the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in t h e pastoral scene of the fourth act, where t h e festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings i n , for t h e
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and paj| themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known W»*tPF
t h e title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
F o r the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on t h e evening before the intended departure of Polixenes
As dancing a n d music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic -Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
L a t e r in the play, " T I M E , as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, t h e lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred t o the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHRONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured fo
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and the Stars (personified), sinking before the C a r *
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from an antique, o r
from the works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e a t Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a s
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings; and
a n opportunity is thus afforded for t h e introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made t o assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes ver*
g r e a t ; nevertheless, uring such authorities as we possess, including the " H y m n t o Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and Other eminent jVofessors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception of
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of an occasional sentence or line s u l k i n g to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
T h e architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly stiperotended by George Godwin, Esq., F . R . S . , who has take!, en ardent interest in my wbrk, for which I
feel most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scbarf, Esq., J u n . , F A . A (author of
t h e Handbook t o the Greek and Pompeian Courts a t the Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken o o
the spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to J a m e s A. Davies, B s a * Lecturer on Ancient Music,forhis
valuable aid in the department which h e has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of t h e public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended t o my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope t h a t my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
apectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such a r e in accordance with t h e
subject and incidents of the play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
the stage alone, to re-embody the p a s t , trusting t h a t the combination may be considered less an exhibition of pageantry appealing to the eye, t h a n a n illustration of history addressed to the understanding!

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY O F

THE WINTER'S TALE
mi

i.

S H A K E S P E A R E has constructed the charming drama of The Winter's
Tale from Robert Green*.
" History of Dorastus and F a w n i a , " and whfle he has sought to heighten and vary the interest ef the
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date t o the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter ot the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and 1 have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which t h e story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident a s the corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence t o a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when a t the summit ot her political prosperity.
A n opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, a t a time when t h e
a r t s flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct t h e world.
Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
t o contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious s o n s , " but which can new, a l a s ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect the country known a s " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: I
xicve therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir T h o m a s H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre ot
t h e play, while it enables me to represent Hie costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with G r e e c e , and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a n a r k e d distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in t h e d r a m a , while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in t h e pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " w h o have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
t h e title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For t h e purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the evening before t h e intended departure of Polixenes.
A s dancing a n d music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic
Dame,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, ha* been attempted.
L a t e r in the play, " T I M E , as C H O B U S , " has been restored, in accordance with t h e poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed t o have taken place from the birth ot
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of t h e play as now represented,
h a s been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHRONOS, the ancient representative of T i m e , has been chosen, and I have ventured t o
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and the Stars (personified), sinking before the C a r
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e at Syracuse has been selected lor t h e ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a s
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings; and
a n opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has betn made t o assimilate the music to t h e
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " H y m n to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
Mr. J . L . H a t t o n has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception ot
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of t h e second scene of the first act, during the progress
of t h e Banquet.
1 should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been catvfully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of t h e action.
The architectural portions of t h e play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superintended by George Godwin, Esq., F . R . S . , who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., J u n . , F . S . A. ( a u t h o r of
t h e Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts a t the Crystal P a l a c e ) , from whom 1 have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind h a s suggested many important details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken o a
t h e spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements t o J a m e s A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music,forh i .
valuable aid in the department which h e has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted t o the judgment of t h e public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended t o my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me t o hope t h a t my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance with t h e
subject and incidents of t h e play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
t h e stage alone, to re-embody t h e p a s t , trusting that the combination may be considered less an a-hvbition of pageantry appealing to the eye, t h a n a n illustration of history addressed to the understanding.

Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel that no period could have

lo contenphitethe manners and habits ot a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can new, alas! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
To connect the country known as "Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: J
nave therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmcr, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bitkynia.
The difference of name in no way affects the iucideuts or metre ot

Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. To carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in

associate him with an allegorical tableau ot Luna and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
of Phcebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure i« taken from an antique, or

The Theatre at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, as
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
To give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
great; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by Dr. Burney, and other eminent Professors,

the " Hymn" which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved throughout;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
j'lie architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superntended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scbarf, Esq., Jun., F.S. A. (author ot
the Handbook to the Greek and Povupeian Courts at the Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many important details. The vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
1 also owe my acknowledgements to James A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
Thus, one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which 1 trust will not be considered inappropriate.

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF~~

THE WINTER'S TALE

S H A K E S P E A R E lias constructed t h e charming drama ot The fVbtler's
Vale from Robert Green's
" History of Doras t its and Fuwnia," and while h e h a s sought t o heighten and vary the interest of the
story by t h e introduction of new characters, h e h a s left t h e incidents of t h e play ( a s in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to t h e time of action.
Chronological contradictious abound throughout t h e live acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter ot the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; a n d I have therefore thought it permissible t o select a period which, while it accords
with t h e spirit of t h e play, may be considered t h e most interesting, as well as t h e most instructive.
T h e pivot on which t h e story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi ;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence t o a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when a t t h e summit ot her political prosperity.
A n opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical e r a , and placing before t h e eye9 of t h e
spectator, tableaux vivants of t h e private and public life of the ancient Greeks, a t a time when t h e
a r t s flourished to a perfection, t h e scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct t h e world.
Assuming that t h e civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, 1 feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish,
t o contemplate t h e manners and habits of a country once " t h e centre of ancient civilization, and t h e
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," b u t which can now, alas ! boast of nothing beyond i t s
history a n d its ruins.
T o connect t h e country known as " B o h e m i a " with a n a g e so remote, would be impossible: I
Hove therefore followed t h e suggestion of Sir Thomas H a n m e r , in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by t h e substitution of Bithyniu.
T h e difference of name in no way affects t h e incidents or metre of
t h e play, while it enables me t o represent t h e costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor a t a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to t h e Homeric kingdom of Troy.
T h e Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in t h e drama, while at t h e same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
t o both. A leading instance is furnished in t h e pastoral scene of the fourth a c t , where the festivities
applicable t o the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for t h e
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
S a t y r s . " I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
t h e title of " Dionysia,"
wherein similar disguises were used, while t h e actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
F o r t h e purpose of presenting with closer accuracy t h e domestic manners of t h e period, Leontes
a n d bis Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on t h e evening before t h e intended departure of Polixenes
As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of t h e celebrated Pyrrhic
Dance,
s o popular throughout t h e principal states of Greece for its martial character, ha* been attempted.
L a t e r in the play, " T I M E , as C H O K U S , " h a s been restored, in accordance with t h e poet's conception. B y this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth ot
P e r d i t a until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
o u t the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of t h e play as now represented,
h a s been preferred to t h e ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. C H R O N O S , the ancient representative of Time, h a s been chosen, and I have ventured t o
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and t h e Stars ("personified), sinking before the C a r
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, o r
from t h e works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e at Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a s
i t is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
a n opportunity is thus afforded for t h e introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness to t h e whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate t b e music to t h e
action. As all writers on t h e subject afford but meagre information, t h e dilhculty here becomes very
g r e a t ; nevertheless, using such authorities a s we possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed t h e overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with t h e exception ot
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of t h e second scene of t h e first act, during t h e progress
of t h e Banquet.
1 should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has beet. carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of a n occasional sentence or line suficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without.
interfering with t h e natural course of t h e action.
T b e architectural portions of t h e play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superntended by George Godwin, Esq., F . R . S . , who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which 1
i*el most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., J u n . , F . S . A. (author o t
t h e Handbook t o the Greek and Pompeian Courts at t h e Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
t h e greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many imp o r t a n t details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot
I also owe my acknowledgements t o J a m e s A . Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which h e has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted t o t b e judgment of the public,
w i t h many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my present attempt will be equally fortunate ; and 1 may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it h a s only been where such a r e in accordance with t h e
subject and incidents of t b e play.
I have endeavoured, and 1 hope not altogether in vain, by t b e united accessor.es of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with t h e rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
t h e stage alone, to re-embody t h e past, trusting that the combination may be considered less an exhibition of pageantry appealing t o the eye, than an illustration of history addressed to t h e understanding,

THE WINTER'S TALE

has constructed the charming drama of The Winter's Tale from Robert Green's
" History of Dorasins and Fa.vnisi," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by the introduction of new characters, be has left the incidents of the play (as in the novel}
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to the
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
The pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi ;
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of the whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Tliucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position In no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit ot her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of the
spectator, tableaux viventt of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, at a time when the
arts flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, I feel that no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can now, alas! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
To connect the country known as " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would he impossible: I
-tare therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmer, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by *he substitution of Bithynia.
The difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre ot
the play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a Feast, on the evening before the intended departure of Polixenes. As dancing and music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
Later in the play, " T I M E , as CHORUS," has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen vears, supposed to have taken place from the birth of
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. To carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHKONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of Luna and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
of Phoebus, which rises with -il! its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman,
The Theatre at Syracuse has been selected lor the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, as
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used for legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
an opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
l o give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
great; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by Dr. Burney, and other eminent Professors,
Mr. J . L. Hatton has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception ot
the " H y m n " which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved throughout;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
The architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superntended by George Godwin, Esq., F.R.S., who has taken an anient interest in my work, for which I
feel most grateful ; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., Jun., F.S.A. (author ot
the Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts at the Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mine) has suggested many important details. The vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
the spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements to James A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
Thus, one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
The favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my present attempt will be equally fortunate ; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
•pectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance with the
subject and incidents of the play.
1 have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
the stage alone, to re-embody the past, trusting that the combination may be considered less an exhibition of pageantry appealing to the eye, than an illustration of history addressed to the understanding.

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE WINTERS TALE

S H A K E S P E A R E has constructed t h e charming drama of The Winter's
Tale from Robert Green*!.
" History of Dorastus and F a w n i a , " and while h e has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by t h e introduction of new characters, he has left t h e incidents of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date t o the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout t h e five acts ; inasmuch as reference is made to t h e
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all b e illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and t a k i n g this incident as the corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, h a d , from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence t o a
position in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical e r a , and placing before i h e eyes of t h e

has constructed the charming drama of The Winter's Tate from Robert Green*,
** History of Dorastus and Fawnia," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by the introduction of new characters, he has left the incidents of the play (as in the norel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the five acts; inasmuch as reference is mad, to the
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and an Italian painter of the sixteenth century.
It is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs c.aaat
all foe illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
The pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of Delphi ,
and taking this incident as the corner-stone of the whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
n—itiou in no way inferior to that of Athens herself, when at the summit of her political prosperity.
An opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era, and placing before the eyes of the
spectator, twMemuc vivunts of the private and public life of the ancient Greeks, at a time when th«
arts flourished to a perfection, the scattered vestiges of which still delight and instruct the world.
Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse. 1 feel that no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
to contemplate the manners and habits of a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can now, alas! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its rains.
To connect the country known as " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would be impossible: 1
Row therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmer, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bithynia.
The difference of name in no way affects the incidents or metre ot
the play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor at a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, and acquiring additional interest from close
proximity to the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
The Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while at the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
applicable to the season of sheep-shearing take place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for the
purpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
Satyrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
the title of " Dionysia," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
and his Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
Of* a Feast, on the evening before the intended departure of Polixenes. As dancing and music
Invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated Pyrrhic Mhmet,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
Later in the play, " T I M S , as CHORUS," has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conception. By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth ot
Perdita until she is seen as the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. To carry
oat the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
has been preferred to the ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages, CHRONOS. the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
asaociate him with an allegorical tableau ot Luna and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
ef Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. Each figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
The Theatre at Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a t
it i* known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used tor legislative or judicial proceedings; and
o n opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
To give completeness to the whole, an endeavour has been made to assimilate the music to the
action. As all writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difficulty here becomes very
great; nevertheless, using such authorities as we possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo," which
Otony consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by Dr. Bnrney, and other eminent Professors,
Mr. J . L. Hatton has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception ot
the " Hymn" which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved throughoet;
the omission of an occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
The architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superntended by George Godwin, Eso., F.R.S., who has taken an ardent interest in my work, for which I
fed most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., Jan., F.S. A. (author ot
the Handbook to the Greek and Pompeian Courts at the Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
the greatest possible assistance and information, and whose pictorial mind has suggested many tntfortaat details. The vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken e a
T a b . owe my acknowledgements to James A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Mafic, for his
valnable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
Thus, one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
The favour extended to my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such are in accordance with the
.abject and incidents of the play.
I have endeavoured, and I hope not altogether in vain, by the united accessories of p . i . t i n g ,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong to
the stage alone, to re-embody the past, trusting that the combination may be considered less an exhiMtfem of pageant ry appealing to the eye, than an illustration of history addressed to the understanding,

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF

THE WINTERS TALE

S H A K E S P E A R E has constructed the charming drama ot The fVinter's
Tale from Robert Green**
" History of Dorastus and Fawnia," and while he has sought to heighten and vary the interest of the
story by t h e introduction of new characters, he has left t h e incidents of the play (as in the novel)
alternating between Sicily and Bohemia, without assigning any specific date to the time of action.
Chronological contradictions abound throughout the live a c t s ; inasmuch as reference is made to the
Delphic oracle, Christian burial, an Emperor of Russia, and a n Italian painter ot the sixteenth century.
I t is evident that when an attempt is made to combine truth with history, conflicting epochs cannot
all be illustrated ; and I have therefore thought it permissible to select a period which, while it accords
with the spirit of the play, may be considered the most interesting, as well as the most instructive.
T h e pivot on which the story revolves, is in fact the decision pronounced by the oracle of D e l p h i ;
and taking this incident as t h e corner-stone of t h e whole fabric, I have adopted a period when
Syracuse, according to Thucydides, had, from a mere Doric colony, increased in magnificence to a
position in no way inferior t o that of Athens herself, when at the summit ot her political prosperity.
A n opportunity is thus afforded of reproducing a classical era,"and placing before the eyes of the

Assuming that the civilization of Athens was reflected by Syracuse, 1 feel t h a t no period could have
been selected more interesting and suggestive, or more likely to give additional zest to those who wish
t o contemplate the manners and habits ot a country once " the centre of ancient civilization, and the
fruitful mother of so many illustrious sons," but which can new, a l a s ! boast of nothing beyond its
history and its ruins.
T o connect the country known a s " Bohemia" with an age so remote, would he impossible: 1
n«--e therefore followed the suggestion of Sir Thomas Hanmer, in his annotations on Shakespeare,
by the substitution of Bithynia.
T h e difference ot name in no way affects the incidents or metre ot
t h e play, while it enables me to represent the costume of the inhabitants of Asia Minor a t a corresponding period, associated so intimately with Greece, a n d acquiring additional interest from close
pn
«ty t o the Homeric kingdom of Troy.
J he Phrygian dress presents a marked distinction between the two races that constitute the chief
actors in the drama, while a t the same time scope is afforded for the introduction of customs common
to both. A leading instance is furnished in the pastoral scene of the fourth act, where the festivities
pplicable t o the season of sheep-shearing t a k e place, and in which Shakespeare brings in, for t h e
irpose of a dance, twelve rustics, " who have made themselves all men of hair, and call themselves
ityrs." I have here ventured to introduce one of those festivals in honour of Bacchus, known under
.he title of " Dionysia," wherein similar disguises were used, while the actors indulged in mad
enthusiasm and extravagant merriment.
For the purpose of presenting with closer accuracy the domestic manners of the period, Leontes
aid this Queen Hermione, together with their Kingly guest, are first discovered towards the termination
of a feast, on t h e evening before the intended departure of Polixenes
As dancing a n d music
invariably formed a portion of such entertainments, a representation of the celebrated PyiThic
Dance,
so popular throughout the principal states of Greece for its martial character, has been attempted.
L a t e r in the play, " T i ME, as C H O R U S , " has been restored, in accordance with the poet's conceptio v By this restoration, the lapse of sixteen years, supposed to have taken place from the birth ot
Perdita until she is seen a s the shepherdess in the fourth act, is rendered more intelligible. T o carry
out the idea, a classical figure, more in harmony with the character of the play as now represented,
h a s been preferred i s t h e ordinary old man with his scythe and hour glass, who was unknown in
classic ages. CHRONOS, the ancient representative of Time, has been chosen, and I have ventured to
associate him with an allegorical tableau of L u n a and the Stars (personified), sinking before the Car
of Phoebus, which rises with all its attributes of splendour. E a c h figure is taken from an antique, or
from the works of Flaxman.
T h e T h e a t r e a t Syracuse has been selected for the ceremony of the trial of Queen Hermione, a s
it is known that in Greece such edifices were frequently used tor legislative or judicial proceedings ; and
a u opportunity is thus afforded for the introduction of a scenic display, equally novel and interesting.
T o give completeness t o the whole, a n endeavour has been made t o assimilate the music to the
action.
«dl writers on the subject afford but meagre information, the difliculty here becomes very
g r " ; nevertheless, using such authorities a s we possess, including the " Hymn to Apollo," which
many consider genuine Greek, and the descriptions given by D r . Burney, and other eminent Professors,
M r . J . L . H a t t o n has composed the overture, entre-actes, and incidental airs, with the exception ot
t h e " H y m n " which is played at the opening of the second scene of the first act, during the progress
of the Banquet.
I should not omit to state that the text of Shakespeare has been carefully preserved t h r o u g h o u t ;
t h e omission of a n occasional sentence or line sufficing to remove all prominent incongruities, without
interfering with the natural course of the action.
T h e architectural portions of the play have, as on many former occasions, been kindly superntended by George Godwin, Esq., F . R . S . , who has taken a n ardent interest in my work, for which I
feel most grateful; and my thanks are peculiarly due to George Scharf, Esq., J a n . , F S . \ . (author ot
t h e Handbook t o the Greek and Pompeian Courts a t the Crystal Palace), from whom 1 have received
t*-e greatest possible assistance a n d information, and whose pictorial mind h a s suggested many important details. T h e vegetation peculiar to Bithynia is adopted from his private drawings, taken on
t h e spot.
I also owe my acknowledgements t o J a m e s A. Davies, Esq., Lecturer on Ancient Music, for his
valuable aid in the department which he has made his particular study.
T h u s , one of Shakespeare's finest productions is now submitted to the judgment of the public,
with many new accompaniments, which I trust will not be considered inappropriate.
T h e favour extended t o my former Shakespearian revivals, encourages me to hope that my present attempt will be equally fortunate; and I may, perhaps, be here permitted to remark, that although
spectacular effects have been introduced, it has only been where such a r e in accordance with' t h e
subject and incidents of the play.
I have endeavoured, a n d 1 hope n o t altogether in vain, by the united accessories of painting,
music, and architecture, in conjunction with the rapid movements and multiplied life which belong t o
t h e stage alone, to re-embody the past, trusting that the combinatiou may be considered less a n exhibition of pageantry appealing to the eye, t h a n a n illustration of history addressed t o the understanding.

SCENE 3.

ZERO'S TENT, & SPANISH ENCAMPMENT

After which will be produced (First Time under the Present Management) SHERIDAN'S Tragic Play of

THE SPANIARDS IN PERU.

The music throughout the play, with the exception of the chorus of " Fly away time," has been compoted by
Mr. J. L. Hatton. The Indian airs are founded on melodies published in Bivero and Tschudi's work on " Peruvian
Antiquities," as handed down to us by the Spaniards, after the conquest.
By the revival of Pizarro, long known as a most attractive play, 1 cannot but think that a wide field is afforded
f.i the introduction of that historical detail which lends new interest to theatrical art. The present age demands
that all dramatic representations must of necessity be accompanied by a certain selection of scenery, dres.es aad
music. The public voice h a . justified me in deciding that truth in these matters i. preferable to inaccuracy.
Henee I conclude, that when an appropriate opportunity is embraced of blending instruction with amusement,
-.hen the n.ind may be informed while the e y . is gratified, the drama is not likely to lose or be degraded by the
4iR.tnp.ed association

The success which has attended a series of Historical Illustrations at the Princess's Theatre, can leave ao
reasonable doubt that public taste approves this description of entertainment. In compliance, therefore, with an
opinion so unequivocally conveyed, 1 have sought for a fresh chapter in the pages of the past, which may combine
with the revival of a popular play, appertaining to a deeply-interesting period, much that is novel in the accompanying arrangements.
Heretofore, with the exception of Sardanapalus, the subjects have been chosen from the creations of Shakespeare. In the present instance, I have selected the well-known drama of Pizarro, (as adapted by Sheridan from
t h . Ge.rr.tan of Kotiebue), for the purpose of exemplifying the customs, ceremonies, and religion of Pera, at the
&im« of the Spanish invasion. The discovery of the Western Hemisphere, by Christopher Columbus (perhaps the
most astounding acht.vwm.at in the annals of human enterprise), opened a way to numerous successors of that
illustrious pioneer, who penetrated region after region of the vast continent, eager for conquest and for gain.
Europe received the startling intelligence, that instead of beii g occupied by tribes of rude and ignorant
savages, Mexico and Peru teemed with millions of humanized beings, far advanced in civilisation, power, and
refinement
In fact, Pitarro and hi. followers had found the kingdom of the Incas inhabited by an industrious, disciplined
«onul*,tioa, united under the sway of a paternal government, possessing numerous works of art, and many national
memorials. While nature appeared to revel in her grandest and most picturesque aspect, the land abounded with
precious gems and metals, to such an extent, that amidst the gardens of temples and palaces, trees and plant, of
gold and silver, most exquisitely manufactured, stood intermingled with natural productions. Birds of the . a m .
costly materials were seen upon the artificial branches, and the interior of the great Temple of the Sun, the most
magnificent structure in the New World, was probably unsurpassed in the richness of its decorations by any
building in the Old. In the production of Sardanapaliis, in 1853, I availed myself of the discoveries of Layard and
Botta, to place before the public a restor.tion of one of the earliest cities enrolled in the world's record. On the
present occasion I venture to hope that a corresponding interest may be excited by the revival of an epoch equally
won-eifnl, although dating little more than three hundred years antecedent to the present time.
By the recent excavations in Assyria, entombed races were raised before the eyes of the living ; while through
the adventurous and unscrupulous spirit of the Spanish conquerors of America, in the sixteenth century, vast
nations, buried in obscurity, unknowing and unknown, were revealed in active existence, occupied with the pursuits
of cultivated life. We read, with surprise mingled with awe, of an extensive empire, whose mysterious origin is lost
in the labyrinth of ages, confined within its own limits, seeking no external intercourse, — of a people dwelling in
towns and hamlets, clustered amidst orchards and gardens, constructing canals and subterraneous aqueducts,
carrying roads over plains and across mountains, forming beautiful terraces on the sides of the Cordilleras, which
bloomed with every variety of vegetation—rich in flocks, that supplied garments of the finest wool, victims for the
altar, and viands for the banquet—erecting palaces for their Incas, and temp.es for their God, with a profusion of
wealth within the walls that almost rivals the marvels of Arabian fable—and what is most remarkable, enjoying she
intellectual aud refined amusement of a poetical drama !
In adapting the selected play to the purposes of historical illustration, passages have been abbreviated which
appeared unimportant, aud several additions made to carry out the object chiefly in view. For instance, at t h .
close of the third act, I have ventured to introduce the principal square of the city during the Grand Festival of
"B.M;ffti, the most magnificent and imposing of all the Peruvian religious ceremonies, which was solemnized with
feasting, dancing, music, and song. On this occasion, when the Great Luminary was worshipped as a visible god,
chiefs, princes, and people, mala and female of every rank, assembled in countless multitudes, and marched in procession, variously attired. Some wore the skins of animals, some appeared as angels, with wings of the Condor,

The success which has attended a .eries of Historical Illustrations at the Princess's Theatre, can lear* no
reasonable doubt that public taste approves this description of entertainment. In compliance, therefore, with an
opinion so unequivocally conveyed, I have sought for a fresh chapter in the pages of t h . past, which may combine
with the revival of a popular play, appertaining to a deeply-interesting period, much that is novel in the accompanying arrangements.
Heretofore, with the exception of Sardanapahu, the subjects have been chosen from the creations of Shakespeare. In the present instance, 1 have selected the well-known drama of Pizarro, (as adapted by Sheridan from
the German of Kotxebue), for the purpose of exemplifying the customs, ceremonies, and religion of Peru, at th*
»ime of the Spanish invasion. The discovery of the Western Hemisphere, by Christopher Columbus (perhaps the
most astounding achievement in the annals of human enterprize), opened a way to numerous successors of that
illustrious pioneer, who penetrated region after region of the vast continent, eager for conquest and for gain.
Europe received the startling intelligence, that instead of beii g occupied by tribes of rude and ignorant
savages, Mexico and Peru teemed with millions of humanized beings, far advanced in civilization, power, and
refinement.
In fact, Picarro and his followers had found the kingdom of the Incas inhabited by an industrious, disciplined
population, united under the sway of a paternal government, possessing numerous works of art, and many national
memorials. While nature appeared to revel in her grandest and most picturesque aspect, the land abounded with
precious gems and metals, to such an extent, that amidst the gardens of temples and palaces, trees and plants of
gold and silver, most exquisitely manufactured, stood intermingled with natural productions. Birds of the same
costly materials were seen upon the artificial branches, and the interior of the great Temple of the Sun, the most
magnificent structure in the New World, was probably unsurpassed in the richness of i t . decorations by any
building in the Old. In the production of Sardanapalus, in 1853, I availed myselt of the discoveries of Layard and
Botta, to place before the public a restoration of one of the earliest cities enrolled in the world's record. On the
present occasion I venture to hope that a corresponding interest may be excited by the revival of an epoch equally
wonderful, although dating little more than three hundred years antecedent to the present time.
By the recent excavations in Assyria, entombed races were raised before the eyes of the living ; while through
the adventurous and unscrupulous spirit of the Spanish conquerors of America, in the sixteenth century, vast
nations, buried in obscurity, unknowing and unknown, were revealed in active existence, occupied with the pursuits
of cultivated life. We read, with surprise mingled with awe, of an extensive empire, whose mysterious origin is lost
in the labyrinth of ages, confined within its own limits, seeking no external intercourse, —of a people dwelling in
towns and hamlets, clustered amidst orchards and gardens, constructing canals and subterraneous aqueducts,
carrying roads over plains and across mountains, forming beautiful terraces on the sides of the Cordilleras, which
bloomed with every variety of vegetation — rich irt flocks, that supplied garments of the finest wool, victims for the
altar, and viands for the banquet—erecting palaces for their lncas, and temples for their God, with a profusion of
wealth within the walls that alm.st rivals the marvels of Arabian fable—and what is most remarkable, enjoying the
intellectual and refined amusement of a poetical drama !

MOUNTAINOUS R E G I O N OVERLOOKING

The music throughout the play, with the exception of the chorus of *' Fly away, time," has been composed by
Mr. J. L. Hatton. The Indian airs are founded on melodies published in Rivero and Tschudi's work on " Peruvian
Antiquities," as handed down to us by the Spaniards, after the conquest.
By the revival of Pixarro, long known as almost attractive play, I cannot but think that a wide field is afforded
forth, introduction of that historical detail which lends new interest to theatrical art. The present age demands
that all dramatic representations must of necessity be accompanied by a certain,selection of scenery, dresses,and
music. The public voice hat justified me in deciding that truth in these matters is preferable to maceuraey.
Hence 1 conclude, that when an appropriate opportunity is embraced of blending instruction with amusement,
•when the mind may be informed while the e y . is gratified, the drama is not likely to lose or be degraded by the
.attempted association

In adapting the selected play to the purposes of historical illustration, passages have been abbreviated which
appeared unimportant, aud several additions made to carry out the object chiefly in view. For instance, at t h .
«lose of the third act, I have ventured to introduce the principal square of the city during the Qrand Festival of
kaymi, the most magnificent and imposing of all the Peruvian religious ceremonies, which was solemnized * S feasting, dancing, music, and song. On this occasion, when the Great Luminary was worshipped a* a visible god,
chiefs, princes, and people, male and female of every rank, assembled in counties, multitudes, and marched in procession, variously attired. Some wore the skins of animals, some appeared a. angels, with wings of the Condor,
»ome in horrible masks threw themselves into posture, like maniacs, while others Uispla).d their characteristic ornaments and warlike arms. High above the gay and joyous crowd, borne on the shoulders of his subjects, and seated
in hit golden chair, came the Monarch, prepared to pour out the consecrated wine as a libation to the Deity. All
advanced to greet with profound adoration the rising sun, which, having arrived at the farthest point of its

S H E R I D A N ' S TRAGIC P L A Y OF

PI1ARRO:
OR, T H E SPANIARDS I N P E R U .

The success which has attended a series of Historical Illustrations at the Princess's Theatre, can leave ao
reasonable doubt that public taste approves this description of entertainment In compliance, therefore, with an
opinion so unequivocally conveyed, I have sought for a fresh chapter in the pages of the past, which may combine
with the revival of a popular play, appertaining to a deeply-interesting period, much that is novel in the accompanying arrangements.
Heretofore, with the exception of Sardanapalus, the subjects have been chosen from the creations of Shakespeare. In the present instance, I have selected the well-known drama of Pizarro, (as adapted by Sheridan from
the German of Kotzebue), for the purpose of exemplifying the customs, ceremonies, and religion of Peru, at the
time of the Spanish invasion. The discovery of the Western Hemisphere, by Christopher Columbus (perhaps the
most astounding achievement in the annals of human enterprize), opened a way to numerous successors of that
illustrious pioneer, who penetrated region after region of the vast continent, eager for conquest and for gain.
Europe received the startling intelligence, that instead of being occupied by tribes of rude and ignorant
savages, Mexico and Peru teemed with millions of humanized beings, far advanced in civilization, power, and refinement. In fact, Pizarro and his followers had found the kingdom of the Incas inhabited by an industrious, disciplined
population, united under the sway of a paternal government, possessing numerous works of art, and many national
memorials. While nature appeared to revel in her grandest and most picturesque aspect, the land abounded with
precious gems and metals, to such an extent, that amidst the gardens of temples and palaces, trees and plants of
gold and silver, most exquisitely manufactured, stood intermingled with natural productions. Birds of the same
costly materials were seen upon the artificial branches, and the interior of the great Temple of the Sun, tbe most
magnificent structure in the New World, was probably unsurpassed in tbe richness of its decorations by any
building in the Old. In the production of Sardanapalus, in 1853, I availed myself of the discoveries of Layard and
Botta, to place before the public a restoration of one of the earliest cities enrolled in the world's record. On the
present occasion I venture to hope that a corresponding interest may be excited by the reviyal of an epoch equally
wonderful, although dating little more than three hundred years antecedent to the present time.
By the recent excavations in Assyria, entombed races were raised before the eyes of the living ; while through
the adventurous and unscrupulous spirit of the Spanish conquerors of America, in the sixteenth century, vast
nations, buried in obscurity, unknowing and unknown, were revealed in active existence, occupied with the pursuits
of cultivated life. We read, with surprise mingled with awe, of an extensive empire, whose mysterious origin is lost
in the labyrinth of ages, confined within its own limits, seeking no external intercourse,—of a people dwelling in
towns and hamlets, clustered amidst orchards and gardens, constructing canals and subterraneous aqueducts,
carrying roads over plains and across mountains, forming beautiful terraces on the sides of the Cordilleras, which
bloomed with every variety of vegetation—rich in flocks, that supplied garments of the finest wool, victims for the
altar, and viands for the banquet—erecting palaces for their Incas, and temples for their God, with a profusion of
wealth within the walls that almost rivals the marvels of Arabian fable—and what is most remarkable, enjoying the
intellectual and refined amusement of a poetical drama I
In adapting the selected play to the purposes of historical illustration, passages have been abbreviated which
appeared unimportant, and several additions made to carry out the object chiefly in view. For instance, at the
close of the third act, 1 have: ventured to introduce the principal square of the city during the Grand Festival of
Raymi, the most magnificent and imposing of all the Peruvian religious ceremonies, which was solemnized with
feasting, dancing, music, and song. On this occasion, when the Great Luminary was worshipped as a visible god,
chief's, princes, and people, male and female of every rank, assembled in countless multitudes, and marched in procession, variously attired. Some wore the skins of animals, some appeared as angels, with wings of the Condor,
some in horrible masks threw themselves into postures like maniacs, while others displayed their characteristic ornaments and warlike arms. High above the gay and joyous crowd, borne on the shoulders of his subjects, and seated
in his golden chair, came the Monarch, prepared to pour out the consecrated wine as a libation to the Deity. All
advanced to greet with profound adoration the rising sun, which, having arrived at the farthest point of its
meridional career, began to retrace its course to the north. Loud and long were the shouts of joy, songs of
triumph, and bursts of clamorous music, when the first rays gilded the summits of the neighbouring mountain
range, and the excited multitude inhaled the atmosphere impregnated with light. As we possess little information
respecting " Quito." (the place named by the dramatist) —the interior of the temple, in the second act, and the view
of the city in the third, are taken from the descriptions so amply given of " Cuzco," the ancient capital of the
empire, once the scene of so much glory and magnificence.
The music throughout the play, with tlie exception of the chorus of " Fly away, time," has been composed by
Mr. J. L. Hatton. The Indian airs are founded on melodies published in Rivero and Tschudi's work on " Peruvian
Antiquities," as handed down to us by the Spaniards, after the conquest.
By tbe revival of Pizarro, long known as a most attractive play, I cannot but think that a wide field is afforded
for the introduction of that historical detail which lends new interest to theatrical art. The present age demands
that all dramatic representations must of necessity be accompanied by a certain selection of scenery, dresses, and
music. The public voice has justified me in deciding that truth in these matters is preferable to inaccuracy.
Hence I conclude, that when an appropriate opportunity is embraced of blending instruction with amusement,
when the mind may be informed while the eye is gratified, the drama is not likely to lose or be degraded by the
ttempted association.

The success which has attended a series of Historical Illustrations at the Princess's Theatre, can leave ao
reasonable dour t that public taste approves this description of entertainment. In compliance, therefore, with an
opinion so unequivocally conveyed, I have sought for a fresh chapter in the pages of the past, which may combine
with the revival of a popular play, appertaining to a deeply-interesting period, much that is novel in the accompanying arrangements.
Heretofore, with the exception of Sardanapalus, the subjects have been chosen from the creations of Shakespeare. In the present instance, I have selected the well-known drama of Pizarro, (as adapted by Sheridan from
the German of Kotnebue), for the purpose of exemplifying the customs, ceremonies, and religion of Peru, at the
time of the Spanish invasion. The discovery of the Western Hemisphere, by Christopher Columbus (perhaps the
most astounding achievement in the annals of human enterprize), opened a way to numerous successors of that
illustrious pioneer, who penetrated region after region of the vast continent, eager for conquest and for gain.
Europe received the startling intelligence, that instead of being occupied by tribes of rude and ignorant
savages, Mexico'and Peru teemed with millions of humanized beings, far advanced iu civilization, power, and refinement. In fact, Pizarro and his followers had found the kingdom of the Incas inhabited b'y an industrious, disciplined
population, united under the sway of a paternal government, possessing numerous works of art, and many national
memorials. While nature appeared to revel in her grandest and most picturesque aspect, the land abounded with
precious gems and metals, to such an extent, that amidst the gardens of temples and palaces, trees and plants of
gold and silver, most exquisitely manufactured, stood intermingled with natural productions. Birds of the same
costly materials were seen upon the artificial branches, and the interior of the great Temple of the Sun, the most
magnificent structure in the New World, was probably unsurpassed in the richness of its decorations by any
building in the Old. In the production of Sardnnapalut, in 1853, 1 availed myself of the discoveries of Layard and
Botta, to place before the public a restoration of one of the earliest cities enrolled in the world's record. On the
present occasion 1 venture to hope that a corresponding interest may be excited by the revival of an epoch equally
wonderful, although dating little more than three hundred years antecedent to the present time.
By the recent excavations in Assyria, entombed races were raised before the eyes of the living ; while through
the adventurous and unscrupulous spirit of the Spanish conquerors of America, in the sixteenth century, vast
nations, buried in obscurity, unknowing and unknown, were revealed in active existence, occupied with the pursuits
of cultivated life. We read, with surprise mingled with awe, of an extensive empire, whose mysterious origin is lost
in the labyrinth of ages, confined within its own limits, seeking no external intercourse, —of a people dwelling in
towns and hamlets, clustered amidst orchards and gardens, constructing canals and subterraneous aqueducts,
carrying roads over p'ains and across mountains, forming beautiful terraces on the sides of the Cordilleras, which
bloomed with every variety of vegetation—rich in flocks, that supplied garments of the finest wool, victims for the
altar, and viands for the banquet—erecting palaces for their Incas, and temples for their God, with a profusion of
wealth within the walls that almost rivals the marvels of Arabian fable—and what is most remarkable, enjoying the
intellectual and refined amusement of a poetical drama !
In adapting the selected play to the purposes of historical illustration, passages have been abbreviated which
appeared unimportant, aud several additions made to carry out the object chiefly in view. For instance, at the
close of the third act, I have ventured to introduce the principal square of the city during the Chand Festival of
Raymi, the most magnificent and imposing of all the Peruvian religious ceremonies, which was solemnized with
feasting, dancing, music, and song. On this occasion, when the Great Luminary was worshipped as a visible god,
chiefs, princes, and people, male and female of every rank, assembled in countless multitudes, and marched in procession, variously attired. Some wore the skins of animals, some appeared as angels, with wings of the Condor,
some in horrible masks threw themselves into postures like maniacs, while others displayed their characteristic ornaments and warlike arms. High above the gay and joyous crowd, borne on the shoulders of his subjects, and seated
in hi. golden chair, came the Monarch, prepared to pour out the consecrated wine as a libation to the Deity. All
advanced to greet with profound adoration the rising sun, which, having arrived at the farthest point of its
meridional career, began to retrace its course to the north. Loud and long were the shouts of joy, songs of
triumph, and bursts of clamorous music, when the first rays gilded the summits of the neighbouring mountain
Tange, and the excited multitude inhaled the atmosphere impregnated with light. As we possess little information
respecting " Quito." (the place named by the dramatist)—the interior of the temple, in the second act, and the view
of the city in the third, are taken from the descriptions so amply given of " Cuzco," the ancient capital of the
•empire, once the scene of so much glory and magnificence.
The music throughout the play, with die exception of the chorus of " Fly away, time," has been composed by
Mr. J. L. Hatton. The Indian airs are founded on melodies published in Rivero and Tschudis work on " Peruvian
Antiquities," as handed down to us by the Spaniards, after the conquest.
By the revival of Pizarro, long known as a most attractive play, I cannot but think that a wide field is afforded
for the introduction of that historical detail which lends new interest to theatrical art. The present age demands
that all dramatic representations must of necessity be accompanied by a certain selection of scenery, dresses, and
music. The public voice has justified me in deciding that truth in these matters is preferable to inaccuracy.
Hence I conclude, that when an appropriate opportunity is embraced of blending instruction with amusement,
when the n.ind may be informed while the eye is gratified, the drama is not likely to lose or be degraded by the
ttempted association.

S H E R I D A N ' S TRAGIC P L A Y OP

OR. T H E SPANIARDS IN PERU.

OB,

T H E SPANIARDS I N PERU.

The success which has attended a series of Historical Illustrations at the Princess's Theatre, can leave a .
reasonable doubt that public taste approves this description of entertainment In. compliance, therefore, with an
opinion so unequivocally conveyed, 1 have sought for a fresh chapter in the pages of the past, which may combine
with the revival of a popular play, appertaining to a deeply-interesting period, much that is novel in the accompanying arrangements.
Heretofore, with the exception of Sardanapalw, the subjects have been chosen from the creations of Shakespeare. In the present instance, I have selected the well-known drama of Pizmro, (as adapted by Sheridan from
the German of Kotzebue), for the purpose of exemplifying the customs, ceremonies, and religion of Peru, at the
time of the Spanish invasion. The discovery of the Western Hemisphere, by Christopher Columbus (perhaps the
most astounding achievement in the annals of human enterprize), opened a way to numerous successors of that
illustrious pioneer, who penetrated region after region of the vast continent, eager for conquest and for gain.
Europe received the startling intelligence, that instead of beirg occupied by tribes of rude and ignorant
savages, Mexico and Peru teemed with millions of humanized beings, far advanced in civilization, power, and refinement. In fact, Pizarro and his followers had found the kingdom of the Incas inhabited by an industrious, disciplined
population, united under the sway of a paternal government, possessing numerous works of art, and many national
memorials. While nature appeared to revel in her grandest and most picturesque aspect, the land abounded with
precious gems and metals, to such an extent, that amidst the gardens of temples and palaces, trees and plants of
gold and silver, most exquisitely manufactured, stood intermingled with natural productions. Birds of the same
costly materials were seen upon the artificial branches, and the interior of the great Temple of the Sun, the most
magnificent structure in the New World, was probably unsurpassed in the richness of its decorations by any
building in the Old. In the production of Sardunapalus, in 1853,1 availed' myself of the discoveries of Layard and
Botta, to place before the public a restoration of one of the earliest cities enrolled in the world's record. On the
present occasion I venture to hope that a corresponding interest may be excited by the revival of an epoch equally
wonderful, although dating little moie than three hundred years antecedent to the present time.
By the recent excavations in Assyria, entombed races were raised before the ejes of the living ; while through
the adventurous and unscrupulous spirit of the Spanish conquerors of America, in the sixteenth century, vast
nations, buried in obscurity, unknowing ami unknown, were revealed in active existence, occupied with the pursuits
of cultivated life. We read, with surprise mingled with awe, of an extensive empire, whose mysterious origin is lost
in the labyrinth of ages, confined within its own limits, seeking no external intercourse,—of a people dwelling in
towns and hamlets, clustered amidst orchards and gardens, constructing canals and subterraneous aqueducts,
carrying roads over plains and across mountains, forming beautiful terraces on the sides of the Cordilleras, which
bloomed with every variety of vegetation—rich in flocks, that supplied garments of the finest wool, victims for the
altar, and viands for the banquet—erecting palaces for their Incas, and teinp.es for their God, with a profusion of
wealth within the walls that almost rivals the marvels of Arabian fable—and what is most remarkable, enjoying the
intellectual and refined amusement of a poetical drama !
In adapting the selected play to the purposes of historical illustration, passages have been abbreviated which
appeared unimportant, and several additions made to carry out the object chiefly in view. For instance, at the
close of the third act, I have ventured to introduce the principal square of the city during the Grand Festival of
Raymi, the most magnificent and imposing of all the Peruvian religious ceremonies, which was solemnized with
feasting, dancing, music, ahd song. On this occasion, when the Great Luminary was worshipped as a visible god,
chiefs, princes, and people, male and female of every rank, assembled in countless multitudes, and marched in procession, variously attired. Some wore the skins of animals, some appeared as angels, with wings of the. Condor,
some in horrible masks threw themselves into postures like maniacs, while others displayed their characteristic ornanents and warlike arms. . High above the gay and joyous crowd, borne on the shoulders of his subjects, and seated
in hi. golden chair, came the Monarch, prepared to pour out the consecrated wine as a libation to the Deity. All
advanced to greet with profound adoration the rising sun, which, having arrived at the farthest point of its
meridional career, began to retrace its course to the north. Loud and long were the shouts of joy, songs of
triumph, and bursts of clamorous music, when the first rays gilded the summits of the r.eighbouring mountain
range, and the excited multitude inhaled the atmosphere impregnated with light. As we possess little information
respecting " Quito." (the place named by the dramatist)—the interior of the temple, in the second act, and the view
of the city in the third, are taken f-pm Jthe descriptions so amply given of '* Cuzco," the ancient capital of the
empire, once the scene of so much glory and magnificence.
The music throughout the play, with the exception of the chorus of " Fly away time," has been composed by
Mr. J. L. Hatton. The Indian airs are founded on melodies published in Kivero aud 'j schudi's work on " Peruvian
Antiquities," as handed down to us by the Spaniards, after the conquest.
By the revival of Pizarro, long known as a most attractive play, 1 cannot but think that a wide field is afforded
for the introduction of that historical detail which lends new interest to theatrical art. The present age demands
that all dramatic representation, must of necessity be accompanied by a certain selection of scenery, dresses, and
music. The public voice has justified me in deciding that truth in these matters is preferable to inaccuracy.
Hence I concrad*, that when an appropriate opportunity is embraced of blending instruction with amusement,
when the mind may b e informed while the eye is gratified, the drama is not likely to lose or be degraded by the
ttempted association.

PIZARRO:
OR, T H E SPANIARDS I N P E R U .

The success which has attended a series of Historical Illustrations at the Princess's Theatre, can leare no
reasonable doubt that public taste appr.res this description of entertainment. In compliance, therefore, with an
opinion BO unequivocally conveyed, I have soughtfora fresh chapter in the pages of the past, which may combine
with the revival of a popular play, appertaining to a deeply-interesting period, much that is novel in the accompanying arrangements.
Heretofore, with the exception of Sardaimpalus, the subjects hare been chosen from the creations of Shakespeare. In the present instance, I have selected the well-known drama of Pizarrv, (as adapted by Sheridan from
the German of Kotzebue), for the purpose of exemplifying the customs, ceremonies, and religion of Peru, at the
time of the Spanish invasion. The discovery of the Western Hemisphere, by Christopher Columbus (perhaps the
most astounding achievement in the annals of human enterprise), opened a way to numerous successors of that
illustrious pioneer, who penetrated region after region of the vast continent, eagerforconquest andforgain.
Europe received the startling intelligence, that Instead of being occupied by tribes of rude and ignorant
savages, Mexico and Peru teemed with millions of humanized beings, far advanced in eiviliaation, power, and refinement. In fact, Pizarro and his followers had found the kingdom of the Incas inhabited by an industrious, disciplined
population, united under the sway of a paternal government, possessing numerous works of art, and many national
memorials. While nature appeared to revel in her grandest and most picturesque aspect, the land abounded with
precious gems and metals, to such an extent, that amidst the gardens of temples and palaces, trees and plants of
sold and silver, most exquisitely manufactured, stood intermingled with natural prodnctions. Birds of the same
. :_..„;
* ...... _ — . nr> 1—r . c , „ the most
any
and
itatta^to'plaee before the public a restoration of one of the earliest cities enrolled in the world's record. On the
present occasion I venture to hope that a corresponding interest may be excited by the revival of an epoch equally
wonderful, although dating little more than three hundred years antecedent to the present time.
By the recent excavations in Assyria, entombed races were raised before the eyes of the living ; while through
the adventurous and unscrupulous spirit of the Spanish conquerors of America, in the sixteenth century, vast
nations buried in obscurity, unknowing and unknown, were revealed in active existence, occupied with the pursuits
of cultivated life. We read, with surprise mingled with awe, of an extensive empire, whose mysterious origin is lost
n the labyrinth of ages, confined within its own limits, seeking no external intercourse,-of a people dwelling m
towns and hamlets, clustered amidst orchards and gardens, constructing canals and subterraneous aqueducts,
carrying roads over plains and across mountains, forming beautiful terraces on the sides of the Cordilleras, which
bloomed with every variety of vegetation-rich in flocks, that suprJ.*.' garments of the finest wool, victims for the
altar and viandsforthe banquet—erecting palaces for their !«*-• »ud temples for their God, with a profusion of
wealth within the walls that almost rjyals the marvels of Arabian »' 1" - a n d what is most remarkable, enjoying the
intellectual and refined amusement oPa poetical drama!
.
In adaotinK the selected play to the purposes of historical illntt ration, passages hare been abbreviated which
appeared unimportantraud several additions made to carry out the object chiefly in view For instance at the
close of the third act, I have ventured to introduce the principal square of the city during the Grand Festwal of
Ravmi the most magnificent and imposing of all the Peruvian religious ceremonies, which was solemnized with
feasting dancing, music, and song. On this occasion, when the Great Luminary was worshipped as a visible god,
chiefs princes, and people, male and female of every rank, assembled ,n countless multitudes, and marched in profession variously Mtked. ' Some wore the skins of animals, some appeared as angels, with wings of the Condor,
some in horrible maiks threw themselves into postures like maniaes, while others d i s c e d their characteristic ornaJ ^ t s and warlike arms. High above the gay and joyous crowd, borne on the shoulders of his subjecU and seated
n hi. zolden chair, came the Monarch, prepared to pour out the consecrated wine as a libation to the Deity. All
a d v L T d to greet with profou.d adoration the r&ng sun, which having arrived at the farthest point of its
meridional career, began to retrace it* course to the north. Loud and long were the shouts of joy, songs of
rriumnh and bursts of clamorous music, when t h . first rays gilded the summ.ts of the .neighbouring moun am
ranee and the excited multitude inhaled the atmosphere impregnated with l.ght. As we possess little information
range
w c t W " Quito " (the place named by the dramatist)-the interior of the temple, in the second act, and the view

the third,

of the city in
in the

pmnire once the scene of so much glory and magnificence.

J. L. Hatton. The Indian airs are founded on melodies published in Rivero and Tschudi s work on " Peruvian
Mr «
Antiouities " as handed down to us by the Spaniards, after the conquest.
Bv"he revival of Pizarro, long known as a most attractive play. I cannot but think that a w.de field is afforded
for the introduction of that historical detail which lends new interest to theatrical art The present age demands
that all dramatic representations must of necessity be accompanied by a certain selection of scenery, dresses, and
r Z i c T h ? Public voice has justified me in deciding that truth in these matters is preferable to inaccuracy.
Hence I conclude, that when I n appropriate opportunity is embraced of blending instruction with amusement
when the ntadmay be informed *hile the eye is gratified the drama is not likely to lose or be degraded by the
tempted association

OVING DIORAMA,

A Midsummer-Aitjh**« Dream wat, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
his creative mind " glowed witli all the wurmth of a youthfnl and lively imagination." TAB poet did not search
into history or tradition for the story, hut, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
" those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon. the Fairy Monarch, and his
Queen Titaniu, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate) accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most bea\itifu|
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of jEschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midsuntmer-Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. .1. L. Hattnn), with the addition of the overtures, entr' actes, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

A Midsummer-Nights Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, a* a period of life when
his creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." Tlie poet did not search
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one

considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of i t . own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustriotis men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes nnce 'hronged to listen to the majestic poetry of /".•.schylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the "Midsummer-Night's Dream'' will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. 3. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' actes, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Br. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

PLAY

A WOOD NEAR ATHENS -(MOONLIGHT)

OF A

MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.
A Midsutnmer-Nighfs Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
bis creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
- those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and h i .
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus ana* Hyppolyta stand forward a. the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of drama.. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate) accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
.Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared

SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF A

MIOSUMMER NIGHTS DREAR.

A Midsummer-Nights Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
his creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
- those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from' the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and h!»
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas, Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate") accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every, educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have seleeted a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of iEschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midsumtner-Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. J. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' acles, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM.

A Midsummer-Nighfs Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
his creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not .search
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
" those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and his
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate") accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), w.re most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations; I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of it. own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beau****!
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of iEschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midtummer'Night'» Dream," will he retained (under the
direction of Mr. J. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' actes, and airs composed expresslyforthis
play by the^late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

PLAY OF A

MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM.

A Midsummer-Nights Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
Ms creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his'own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
•'those unparalleled compositions which have rendered bin. the delight and wonder of succewive -ges."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Qberon, the Fairy Monarch, Mid his
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
hare made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate") accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were rao6» probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilisation that exist in every}educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, 1 have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
tjejof its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
""stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
"he world had ever seen.
Tie Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of ^Eschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midtummer-Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr 3. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, enlr' uctts, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

bis creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search

Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and his

have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate', accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retain«if;the
Fgyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of j»j.schylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midsummer-Nighfs Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. 3. h. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' actes, and airs composed expressly for thm
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

Egyptian features introduced by Oecrops, the mythical founder of t h e city.
Such edifices could have nothing in
common with t h e impressions of Ore. k civilization that exist in every'educated mind.
li fluenced by these
considerations, 1 have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
t o one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it h a d attained its greatest splendour ih literature and in a r t —
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing t h e most beautiful
objects the world h a d ever seen.
T h e Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with t h e
T h e a t r e of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of iEschylus, Sophocles, and
E u r i p i d e s ; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred t r u t h were first
promulgated to the Athenian citi-ens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midsummer-Night'*
Dream," will be retained (under t h e
direction of Mr. J . L . H a t t o n ) , with the addition of the overtures, eritr' tides, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Or. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

SHAKESPEARE'S

PLAY OF A

AOT 3. Seen. 1.

T HE

DANCB OF F A I R I E S .

A Midsummer-Nights Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
his creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
jnto history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
«' those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and his
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolj ta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
hare made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus t o
render complete (or proximate) accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every] educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations. I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of jEsehylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill iron, whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midsummer-Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. .1. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' octet, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts ol
that celebrated master,

chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proxiniatel accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by C'ecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common wHh the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every'educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of ^Eschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the "Midsummer-Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. .1. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' actes, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts ot
that celebrated master.

PLAY

OF A

MIDSUMMER NIGHH D M .

A Midsummer-Nights Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
his creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
jnto history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
«' those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and h i .
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate') accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilisation that exist in everyj educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of /Eschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midmmmer'Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. 3, L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, eittr' aetes, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts ot

SHAKESPEARE'S

PLAY OF A

MIDSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM,

A Midsummer-Nights jD**»Vt was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
bis creative aiind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
into history or tradition Hf the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
•'those unparalleled. coitepositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart S S P t § e supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and his
ott«eti Titani*, tt« classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
fnost harmonioas of dramas. Nevertheless, the geueral character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered a ith regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate") accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were mosf probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every' educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it hud attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of ..F.schylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were Arst
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midmmmer-Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. .1. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, etitr' aetes, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

OF A

MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.

A Midsummer-Nights Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
bis creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
;nto history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
•'those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and hi*
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate1) accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by C'ecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Gret k civilization that exist in every' educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in lit. raturc and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
*•
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of iEsrhylns, Sophocles, and
Euripides ; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Mid-tummer-NighCs Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. .1. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' octet, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

OF A

MIDSUMMER NI6RTS DREAM.

A Midmmmer-Mghfs Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of Kfe when
hi. creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
jnto history or tradition lor the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
«' those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and his
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
h*,e made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, 1 have held myself unlettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time df Theseus to
render complete (or proximate") accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Firyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could hare nothing in
sosmnon with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
*r» one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had-attained its greatest splendour hi literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
•abject? the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of jEschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citi-ens by apostolic inspiration.

DANCE

A Midsummer-Nighta Dream was, necording to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
Ms creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
•'those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and bis
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
roost harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximatel accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cccropa, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, 1 have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Teraplos, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of ^Eschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midsummer-Night'l Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. .1. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' actes, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts oi
that
»t celebrated master.

ACT A.—Seeat- I .

T I T AN I A'S R O W E R .
ATHENS. INTERIOR . O F QUINCE'S HOUSE.

OF A

A Midswmmer-Nighfs Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
bis creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not search
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
«' those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and hit
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of (.reek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
reuder complete (or proiiniate") accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Ce< rops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of (.reek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in lii. isiture and in art—
when it stood in its pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of /f-'srhylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that, memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midsummer-Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. •'. L. llatton), «ith the addition of the overtures, entr' seta, and airs composed expresslyforthis
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohu Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

SHAKESPEARE'S

DSUMMER NIGHTS DREAM.

. lultrttmmer-Nighfs Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
his creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not scarh
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
•* those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him tl«e delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and his
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have wade Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximatel accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in ts pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the w.rld had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of ^Eschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizen, by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midiummer-NigMt Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. J. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' octet, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of
that celebrated master.

IIRSUMMER NIGHT'S BREAM,

SHAKESPEARE'S

MIDSUMMER NIGHT's DREAM

A Midsummer-Nights Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
his creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poetdid not searh
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
"those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and his
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
hare made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus to
render complete (or proximate1! accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may be added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), wire most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Ceerops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. influenced by these
considerations, 1 h'ave selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens ns it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in ts pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
object, the w.rld had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of yf-schylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the " Midsummer-Night's Dream," will be retained (under the
direction of Mr, J . L, Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' acles, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Burtholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts ot
that celebrated master.

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H E two latest Shakespearean revivals a t tbis theatre, namely, The Winter's 7'ule and Midsummer
Night's Dream, atlbrded opjioiluiiilks of illustrating t h e manners, costumes, and architecture ot
• ancient Greece, as (Mice co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting t h e far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now r e t u r n to t h e homestead of historr, a n d
offer to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from our own annals, in which o u r national
poet has depicted the tierce and turbulent passions of o u r ancestors, and thus immortalised events o f
the deepest interest to e.eiy Knglish mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakesp e a r e ; yet he still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and i m perishable. H i s historical plays present restrospective t r u t h , encircled by a halo of poetic genius ;
a n d nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
than in the tragedy of King liir.'und the Second. T h e action extends over little more than the t w o
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign —those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
ihe ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and t h o a s sassin's stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with u n sparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
that the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with sympatl v for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. T o show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of •• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chancer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
o a r native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury T a l e s , " not long before the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
J o h n Wicklifte, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth ot one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. T h e Lists a t Coventry—the Fleet at Milford H a v e n — t h e Castles of Pembroke and Flint—the G a r d e n , where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing news"-—the Great
Hall at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride ot kingly sway, and afterwards selected as t h e
ince where unkinged Richard was constrained " w i t h his own hands to give away his crown"-—the
oyal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " in grief and p a t i e n c e ; " thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
JII t h e speech ot York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play.
T h e few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of t h e mob in tbis Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
event;
and are added with t h e view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which t h e creation- of the painter's a r t a r e endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste tor recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, h a s for some
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion of knowledge---to s u n o u n d t h e glowing imagery of the great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which he writti—~mtlixmg
the scenes and actions which h e
deacribes---exhibiting men as they once lived---can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
genius. Repeated success justifies t h e conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with t h e general
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, arc enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that t h e
course 1 have adoptcjl is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
ot an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture and entr tides, h a s been composed a n d
adapted by M r . J . L H a t t o n , in accordance with the character of t h e period. T h e tune which
accompanies the D a n c e of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing t h e
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to he as old as t h e reign of Edward the Second, a n d
is now published in a work by W . Chappell, E s q . , F.S.A., entitled " P o p u l a r Music of t h e Olden
Time."
Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's Dance is preserved in a manuscript written a n d
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in thcDresses appropriated to
the Fools. T h e Morris D a n t e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed t o have been derived
from the Fool's Dance ; and thence a r e traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " S w e e t Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' aetes
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
served to keep alive the feeling of regret for King Richard's fate.
T h e Privy Council Chamber, the restoration of the Welsh Castles,, the Traitor's G a t e at the Tower,
and St George's Hall a t Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve a n d assistants) under t h e
authority of Anthony S a l , in, Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry Shaw, Esq., F . S A . , I am indebted for much
zealous assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending t h e preparations for
the combat a t Coventry, the bed room of the dying J o h n of G a u n t , and many of t h e accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e Garden at Langley, the interior of the D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster Hall, and the Dungeon a t Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, E s q , F.S.A.; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., a n d Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for t h e heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
G. ? c h a r t , Esq , jun., F . S . A . , for many valuable suggestions.
The French metrical history of the deposition of K i n g Richard t h e Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in its illuminated pages ; and the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
fn addition to these au.horities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairhoit, and Shaw have been consulted.
By t h e preceding statement I guarantee t h e truthfulness and fidelity of t h e entire p i c t u r e ; while ,
1 also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that h a s been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
for their antiquarian knowledge, a n d whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts'is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere t o the plan of illustration I have hitherto adopted.

MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.

t h e Second.

MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM

A Midsummer-Nights Dream was, according to the best authorities, written by Shakespeare, at a period of life when
bis creative mind " glowed with all the warmth of a youthful and lively imagination." The poet did not scarh
into history or tradition for the story, but, relying solely on his own exquisite genius, bequeathed to posterity one of
"'those unparalleled compositions which have rendered him.the delight and wonder of successive ages."
Apart from the supernatural agencies, which relate to the quarrels of Oberon, the Fairy Monarch, and his
Queen Titania, the classical figures of Theseus and Hyppolyta stand forward as the chief human personages of this
most harmonious of dramas. Nevertheless, the general character of the play is so far from historical, that while I
have made Athens and its neighbourhood the subject of illustration, I have held myself unfettered with regard to
chronology. Indeed, sufficient is not known of the details of Greek life and architecture in the time of Theseus t o
render complete (or proximate^ accuracy possible, even if a theatrical representation of the period were attempted.
It may bt added, that the buildings existing in Athens during that early age (twelve hundred years before the
Christian era), were most probably rude in construction, were formed of the simplest materials, and retained the
Egyptian features introduced by Cecrops, the mythical founder of the city. Such edifices could have nothing in
common with the impressions of Greek civilization that exist in every educated mind. Influenced by these
considerations, I have selected a later period, in the hope of conveying an idea of Athens as it would have appeared
to one of its own inhabitants, at a time when it had attained its greatest splendour in literature and in art—
when it stood in ts pride and glory, ennobled by a race of illustrious men, and containing the most beautiful
objects the world had ever seen.
The Acropolis, on its rocky eminence, surrounded by marble Temples, has been restored, together with the
Theatre of Bacchus, wherein multitudes once thronged to listen to the majestic poetry of /Eschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides; and near which stands that memorable hill from whence the words of sacred truth were first
promulgated to the Athenian citizens by apostolic inspiration.
A portion of the music, hitherto introduced in the "Midsummer-Night's Dream" will be retained (under the
direction of Mr. .1. L. Hatton), with the addition of the overtures, entr' actes, and airs composed expressly for this
play by the late Dr. Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, and pronounced to be amongst the most successful efforts of.
that celebrated master.

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H E two latest Shakespearean revivals a t this theatre, namely, The Winters
Tale and Midsummer
Night'i' Dream, afforded opportunities of illustrating t h e manners, costumes, and architecture of
ancient G r e e c e , as once co-c.xistent in t h e cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting t h e far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return to the homestead of history, and
offer to the public one of I hose exciting dramas drawn from our own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the fierce and turbulent passions of o u r ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
t h e deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakesp e a r e ; yet h e still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. His historical plavs present restrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic g e n i u s ,
a n d nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in the tragedv of King Richard the Second. T h e action extends over little more than the two
closing years of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of another, t h e gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the; a s sassin's stroke. Although t h e infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with unsparing fidelity, vet England's, weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
t h a t the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with s y m p a t l v for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying t h e ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. T o show the importance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that the same historical page
which is blotted with the recital of «• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured t h e political horizon,
a n d whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
e « r native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithless,
ness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " C a n t e r b u r y T a l e s , " not long before the
throne of England was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
J o h n Wickliffe, " t h e morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry roar
of contending passions: and in t h e hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed t h e seed, which, after a
g r o w t h of one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
I n the present stage representation I have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of medieval
history. T h e Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford H a v e n — t h e Castles of Pembroke and F l i n t —
t h e G a r d e n , where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his " u n p l e a s i n g n e w s " — t h e Great
H a l l at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sway, and afterwards selected as the
place where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own hands to give away his c r o w n " — t h e
Royal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " i n grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech of York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play.
T h e few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of that remarkable
event;
a n d are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive to the diffusion ol knowledge—to s u n o u n d the glowing imagery of the great Po*t
with accompaniments I rue to the time of which he wi ites—realizing
the scenes and actions which h e
describes--exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from Ihc enduring influence of hisgenius. Repeated success justifies the conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with t h e general
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that t h e
course I have adopted is supported by the irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including the overture and entr actes, hits been composed a n d
adapted by M r . .1. L H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of the period. T h e tune which
accompanies the Dance of Itinerant Fools, introduced in t h e Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, a n d
is now published in a work by W . Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " P o p u l a r Music of the Olden
Time."
Strutt remarks that a vestige ol the Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written a n d
illuminated in the reign of Edward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in thcDresses appropriated to
the Fools. T h e Morris D a n c e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from t h e Fool's Dance ; and thence are traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " S w e e t Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' actts
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
served to keep alive the feeling of regret for King Richard's fate.
T h e Privv Council Chamber, t h e restoration of the Welsh Castles, the Traitor's G a t e at the Tower
and S t . George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve and assistants) under t h e
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry Shaw, Esq., F . S A . , I am indebted for much
zealous assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending t h e preparations for
t h e combat a t Coventry, the bed room of the dying J o h n of G a u n t , and many of the accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e Garden at Langley, the interior of the D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London. Westminster H a l l , and the Dungeon at Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard B u r k e ,
Ulster, have afforded me the information requisite for t h e heraldic adornments. I a m also indebted to
G . .^charf, Esq , jun., F . S . A . , for many valuable suggestions.
T h e French metrical history of the deposition of K i n g Richard t h e Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in its illuminated pages ; a n d the knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
I n addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement, I guarantee the truthfulness and fidelity of t h e entire picture; while
I also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
for their antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to the plan of illustration 1 have hjtherto adopted.

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H E two latest Shakespearean revivals i t this theatre, namely, The Winter's Tale a n d Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities ot illustrating t h e manners, costumes, a n d architecture of
a n c i e n t Greece,' as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting t h e far-famed regions of classical anfiquity, I now teturn to t h e homestead of history, a n d
o n l r t o the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from »ur own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
t h e deepest interest to every English mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from Shakesp e a r e - yet h e still lives to the world with " h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and i m perisbable His historical plays present retrospective t r u t h , encircled by a halo of poetic genius ;
a n d nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in the tragedv of King Richard the Second. T h e action extends over little more tlian the t w o
closing Years of that unhappy monarch's r e i g n - t h o s e brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
A lesson', exhibiting a s thev do t h e strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of on* king upon
the ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and the, a s sassin's stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with u n sparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
t h a t the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with sympatl y for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning t h e ill-deserving monarch. To show the i m portance of the period to the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that t h e same historical page
^ h i c h is blotted with the recital of «• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
a n d whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined a n d smoothed
our native" Iono-ne, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjury and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury Tales,' not long before t h e
throne of F n g l i n d was yielded to the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
J o h n Wicklifte, " the morning star of the Reformation," made himself heard amidst the angry r o a r
of contending passions: and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
g r o w t h ot one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present sta<*e representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of niedneval
history
T h e Lists a t Coventry—the Fleet a t Miltord Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and F l i n t —
t h e Garden where " Old Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his '«impleading n e w s " — t h e G r e a t
H a l l at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride ot kingly sway, and afterwards selected as t h e
place where unkinged Richard" was constrained " w i t h his own bands to give away his c r o w n " — t h e
Royal Chambers and the Roval Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
t h e triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
King,' " in grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
i n t h e speech ol York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play.

event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture in which the creations oftlie painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste tor recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public, and surely, an attempt t o render dramatic representation* conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to surround t h e glowing imagery of t h e great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which h e writes—realizing the scenes and actions which he
describes—exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of bis
genius
Repeated success justifies t h e conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with t h e general

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H E t w o latest Shakespearean revivals t t this theatre, namely, The IVinter's Tale and Midsummer
Night's Bream, afforded opportunities ot illustrating t h e manners, costume., a n d architecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting t h e far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return t o t h e homestead of history, a n d
offer to t h e public one of those exciting dramas drawn from mir own annals, in which o u r national
poet h a s depicted t h e fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events of
the deepest interest t o every .".n.lisli mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide u s from Shakesp e a r e ; yet h e still lives to the world with ' ' h i s fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. H i s historical plays present restrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic genius ;
and nowhere has he more conspicuously combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
t h a n in the tragedy of King- Richard the Second. T h e action extends over little more than the two
closing years of that unhappy monarch's r e i g n - t h o s e brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the Strength and weakness of humanity, t h e elevation of one king upon
t h e ruin of another, t h e gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and t h e assassin's stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with u n sparing fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
that the heart responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with s y m p a t l y for woe, although
produced by wrong, pitying the ill-fated, and pardoning the ill-deserving monarch. T o show the importance of t h e period t o the progress of civilization, it may be remarked that t h e same historical page
which is blotted with t h e recital of '• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves t h e memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform.
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste refined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with t h e perjury a n d faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " Canterbury T a l e s , " not long before the
throne of England was yielded t o the younger branch of the Plantagenets.
J o h n Wickliffe, " the morning star of t h e Reformation," made himself heard amidst t h e angry r o . r
of contending passions; and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth of one hundred and fiftv years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of mediaeval
history. T h e Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and F l i n t —
the Garden, where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his " unpleasing n e w s " — t h e Great
Hall at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride of kingly sw.iy, and afterwards selected as t h e
place where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own hands to give away his c r o w n " — t h e
Royal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured t o introduce
the triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
K i n g , " in grief and patience;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in t h e speech ot York to his Duchess, Iywards the close of the play.
T h e few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous .irclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to (he circumsttmces of that remarkable
event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picture, in which t h e creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public j and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representations conducive t o the diffusion of knowledge—to surround t h e glowing imagery of t h e great Poet
with accompaniments true to the time of which h e writes—re«tew,e the scenes and actions which h e
describes--exhibiting men as they once lived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
srenius
Repeated success justifies t h e conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with the general
feeling
W h e n plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences foi successive months, I cannot be wrong in presuming that t h e
course I have adopted is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
of an overwhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture and entr actes, has been composed a n d
adaoted by M r J L H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of t h e period. I he tune which
accompanies the D a n c e of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing the
oTnertant multitude, is adapted from an air said t o be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is K pubTisted in a work' by W . Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " P o p u l a r Music o t the Olden
Time"
S t r a i t remarks t h a t ' a vestige ol the Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written a n d
illuminated in the reign of Edward t h e Third, the Dancers being equipped in theDresses appropriated t o
the Fools T h e Morris Dance, which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
from t h e Fool's D a n c e ; and thence are traced the bells which characterised the Morris dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of « Sweet Richard," introduced in the overture, and again in the entr actes
Preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the prod.utio,, of some contemporary bard, and
; „ „ . J ~ f V P P „ alive t h e feeline of regret for K i n g Richard s fate.
T h e P r i v y ^ K n c i t Chambef, t h e restoration o f t h e Welsh Castles, the Traitor's G a t e a t the Tower
and S t George's Hall a t Windsor, have been painted ("by M r . Grieve and assistants) under t h e
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry Shaw, Esq., F . S A . , I am indebted for much
zealous assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, . n d superintending t h e preparations for
t h e combat a t Coventry, the bed room of the dying J o h n of G a u n t and many of t h e accessories
i n d u c e d into other scenes. T h e Garden at Langley, the intenor of the D u k e ot Lancaster . Palace,
the streets of Old L o n d o n , Westminster H a l l , and the Dungeon a t Pomfret, have been sanctioned by
G e o i e Godwin, Esq., F . S . A . ; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A.. and Sir Bernard B u r k e ,
Ulstef have afforded me the information requisite for t h e heraldic adornments. I am also indebted to
G Scharf E s o , iun., F . S . A . , for many valuable suggestions.

T h e F r e n c h metrical history of the deposition of K i n g Richard the Second, written by a contemnorarv and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period

KING RICHARD THE SECOND.
T H E two latest Shakespearean revivals at this theatre, namely, The ff "inter's Title and Midsummer
Night's Dream, afforded opportunities ot illustrating t h e manners, costumes, and aieliitecture of
ancient Greece, as once co-existent in the cities of Syracuse and Athens.
Quitting the far-famed regions of classical antiquity, I now return to the homestead of historv, and
tiller to the public one of those exciting dramas drawn from -Or own annals, in which our national
poet has depicted the fierce and turbulent passions of our ancestors, and thus immortalised events til
the deepest interest to every E n ' l i s h mind. Nearly two centuries and a half divide us from >hakesp e a r e ; vet he still lives to the world with "'his fame unparalleled," equally unapproachable and imperishable. His historical plays present retrospective truth, encircled by a halo of poetic genius ;
and nowhere has he more lonspicuouslv combined accurate statement of fact with beauty of language
than in the tragedy o f King hichind the Second. T h e action extends ever little more than the two
closing vears of that unhappy monarch's reign—those brief but eventful years which teach so terrible
a lesson, exhibiting as they do the strength and weakness of humanity, the elevation of one king upon
the ruin of another, the gorgeous pageantry of royal state contrasted with the dungeon and t h e a s sassin's stroke. Although the infirmities and irresolution of Richard's character are drawn with u a suaring fidelity, yet England's weak and erring king breathes his sorrow in words so sweetly touching,
that the heart, responds to the poet's mighty influence, and throbs with sympatl y for woe, although

which is blotted with the recital of '• murders, treasons, and detested sins," preserves the memory of
two illustrious men, whose light was undimmed by the dark clouds that obscured the political horizon,
and whose names will ever remain associated with the advancement of literature and reform,
Geoffrey Chaucer, known as the father of English poetry, whose elegant taste reined and smoothed
our native tongue, imbibed the same atmosphere that was impregnated with the perjuiy and faithlessness of conflicting parties, and indited his ever-memorable " C a n t e r b u r y T a l e s , " not long before the

of contending passions , and in the hearts of fiery and seditious men sowed the seed, which, after a
growth ot one hundred and fifty years, was destined to expand into the standard religion of our country.
In the present stage representation 1 have endeavoured to produce a true portraiture of medieeval
history. 1 he Lists at Coventry—the Fleet at Milford Haven—the Castles of Pembroke and Flint—the Garden, where " O l d Adam's likeness" startles the Queen with his "unpleasing n e w s " — t h e Great
Hall at Westminster, rebuilt by Richard, in his pride ot kingly sway, and afterwards selected as t h e
place where unkinged Richard was constrained " with his own hands to give away his crown"—-the
Royal Chambers and the Royal Prison—are all either actually restored, or represented in conformity
with contemporaneous authorities. Between the third and fourth acts I have ventured to introduce
the triumphal entry into London of the " mounting" Bolingbroke, followed by the deposed and captive
King, " in grief and patience ;" thus embodying in action what Shakespeare has so beautifully described
in the speech ot York to his Duchess, towards the close of the play.
'I he few sentences intervening amidst the clamorous acclamations of the mob in this Historical
Episode are selected from the Chronicles which relate to the circumstances of thut remarkable
event;
and are added with the view of reviving, as far as possible, a scene that actually occurred in London
upwards of four hundred and fifty years since. T h e entire tableau may be considered as an historical
picmre, in which the creations of the painter's art are endowed with animated reality.
An increasing taste for recreation wherein instruction is blended with amusement, has for some
time been conspicuous in the English public; and surely, an attempt to render dramatic representat ons conducive to the diffusion of knowledge—to surround t h e glowing imagery of t h e great Poet
with accompaniments trite to the time of which he writes—-realizing the scenes and actions which he
describes—-exhibiting men as they once Jived—can scarcely detract from the enduring influence of his
o-enius. Repeated success justifies t h e conviction that 1 am acting in accordance with t h e general
feeling. When plays, which formerly commanded but occasional repetition, are enabled, by no derogatory means, to attract audiences for successive months, 1 cannot be wrong in presuming that t h e
course 1 have adopted is supported by t h e irresistible force of public opinion, expressed in the suffrages
ot an ovetuhelming majority.
T h e Music throughout the piece, including t h e overture and entr' actes, has been composed and
adapted by M r . .1. I . H a t t o n , in accordance with t h e character of the period. T h e tune which
accompanies the D a n c e of Itinerant Fools, introduced in the Episode for the purpose of amusing the
expectant multitude, is adapted from an air said to be as old as the reign of Edward the Second, and
is now published in a work by W . Chappell, Esq., F.S.A., entitled " P o p u l a r Music of the Ulden
Time."
Strut* remark., that a vestige ol the Fool's D a n c e is preserved in a manuscript written and
illuminated in the reign of Fdward the Third, the Dancers being equipped in theDresses appropriated to
the Fools. T h e Morris D a n t e , which afterwards became so popular, is supposed to have been derived
Iron, the Fool's D a n c e ; and thence are traced the bells which characterised the Mortis dancers. T h e
ancient popular Welsh air of " Sweet Richard." introduced in the overture, and again in the entr' actes
preceding the third act and episode, is supposed to be the production of some contemporary bard, and
served to keep alive the feeling of regret tor King Hichard's fate.
T h e Privv Council Chamber, the restoration of the Welsh Castles, the Traitor's Gate at the Tower
and St George's Hall at Windsor, have been painted (by M r . Grieve and assistants) under t h e
authority of Anthony Salvin, Esq., F.S.A. T o Henry Shaw, Esq., F.SA., I am indebted for much
zealous assistance, besides supplying the necessary drawings, and superintending t h e preparations for
the combat at Coventry, the bed room of the dying J o h n of G a u n t , and many of t h e accessories
introduced into other scenes. T h e Garden at Langley, the interior of the D u k e of Lancaster's Palace,
the streets of Old London, Westminster Hall, and the Dungeon at PomfVet, have been sanctioned by
George Godwin, Esq., 1<\S.A.; while Thomas Willement, Esq., F.S.A., and Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster have afforded me the information requisite for the heraldic adornments. 1 am also indebted to
G. - c h a r t , Esq , juii., F.S.A., for many valuable suggestions.
T h e French metrical history of the deposition of K i n g Richard the Second, written by a contemporary, and preserved in the British Museum, affords undoubted evidence of the costume of the period
in its'illuminated p a g e s ; and t h e knowledge of my valued friend, Colonel Hamilton Smith, in this
branch, has been freely imparted in aid of my present undertaking.
In addition to these authorities, several manuscripts and books in the British Museum, together
with the works of Strutt, Meyrick, Fairholt, and Shaw have been consulted.
By the preceding statement I guarantee t h e truthfulness and fidelity of t h e entire picture; while
I also gratefully acknowledge the assistance that has been so liberally afforded to me by men eminent
tor tlteir antiquarian knowledge, and whose conviction of the usefulness of my efforts is a gratifying
encouragement to adhere to the plan of illustration I have hitherto adopted.
