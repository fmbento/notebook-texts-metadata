TUESDAY, February, 25, 1817.
Thè Manager of Dkùry-LanÈ, Tîif.jLtre, haying laici before the SubCommittee of Management the Posting Bill issued by Coment-Garden Theatre, this Day respecting Mr. BOOTH, has been instructed by them to declare, that they never entered into, or knew of the existence of such an Agreement as that tvhich has been stated to the Priblic On the authority of a Letter from a late Member of their own body. If such an Agreement was ever entered into with the Proprietor^ of Cotent-Garden Theatre, it must h ive been by that late Member whose Letter has been published, and who, on other occasions, singly acted in the name and authority of the whole Committee, without being authorized so to do. The implied understanding which has existed for many years between thé Theatres, Was entered into for the purpose of preventing any tampering with and inveigling of each other’s fegularly articled Performers, and WaS never construed so oppressively to the Profession, as to extend to Act* r> positively discharged, or to those who had merely had an inconclusive négociation.
If any proof were wanted of the truth of this statement, it is to be found in innumerable instances, arid particularly very lately in the instance of a celebrated Actress, (Mrs, GloVer,) who only quitted Drury*Lane '1 heatre at the close of the last Season, and yet performed at Covent-Garden Theatre, at the commencement of the present Season, without any lèaVe asked or communication whatever with the management of Drury-Lane Theatre. Mr BOOTH was discharged from Covent-Garden at the close ot list Season, he returned into the Country, and there concluded an engagement with another Manager upon proof of his entire discharge from his prior engagement.
If the mere appearance at a: Theatre in a trai part, is to preclude all other Theatres from engaging the performer so appending for a year, it will be in the power of any Manager to invite any celeWated provincial Performer for a night, then offer him a salary totally inadequate to his merits, and thereby deprive the metropolis of his talent, or to'use Mr. Booth’s own language “shelve** that Performer for a whole year. An agreement that provided for such a result, as also for that of preventing any Performer, positively discharged, from pursuing his profession for a whele year in the metropdis, would not in the opinion of Uie Committee, be a justifiable protection of Thialrical property, but an attempt to óppress and enslave a respectable Profession for no one laudable object.
This statement has been thought due to the Fubliç.the question is now fully before them ; and the Manager has received final instructions to take no further public notice of any insinuations, mis-statements o? calumnies, from whatsoever quarter they may come.
