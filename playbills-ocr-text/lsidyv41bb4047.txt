The story of this extraordinary ;.nd interesting piece, took its rim- from a Prince of Milan's being
«il«appointed by a lady whose hand he had sought; who, on the point of marriage with him, preferred
a Seighbourliig prince, merely for his superior power and splendour, which caused in the despairing
'over so great a disgust towards the sex, that be resolved never to unite himself to a woman who would
;iot he faithful to him under every circumstance.—In pursuit of this priidigy, he Is led by chance to St.
Bertrand's cave, where he finds Carlo Foscari (the Duke of Venice', near kinsman*, murdered by
oanditti, but before Foscari expired, he pledged to htm a solemn oath, that he would revenge his death.
To effect this, hf joins the banditti, which he finds to be five in number ; among them helearns ther*
1, a pint ripening in Venice, to overturn its Constitution and change the system of Government Having
received all the information that is necessary, he fulfils the oath made to the murdered Fo-cari, by
causing the wretches who perpetrated the horrid act, to be delivered up to public justice, which he
doe. under the name of Flodoardo, an enterprising young soldier of fortune; under which character
also he attracts the notice of the Duke, and becomes enamoured of bis daughter Rosabella : hut true to
the resolution he had formed, of proving the faith of the woman he would unite his destiny with, trie,
her affection for him under a variety of characters and situations. For this purpose he affixes a notice
to the pahice gates, containing these remarkable words : '• the banditti who suffered yesterday, have left
a sixth behind them, Whose single arm equals those of the other five. Ye who ne. d my dagger seek
me! As a proof of my skill, let St. Bertraud's Cave be searched; 'twas there I stabbed to the heart the
senator, Carlo Foscari.——From the biavo Rugantino." Under this character he has the happiness
to prove the constancy of his mistress, and to defeat the projects of the conspirators, who meet with
the reward due to Treason, while the country is restored to happiness and tranquillity.

Zcmbuca, King of Persia, is a turbulent Tyrant, who oppres.es all within his influence. He conceive, a criminal passion for Almazaide, the betrothed wife of his friend, General Selim, of whose
valour and popularity he feels jealous; to remedy this, he dispatches him on an expedition against >
powerful body of insurgents, with promises of iustant Bupport. The succours are purposely withheld, which occasions the defeat of his General, and which Zembuca uses as the base pretext for hit
disgrace and banishment. Selim is proscribed, and a reward offered for bis head. The persecuted
fugitive finds shelter in the Net-Maker'. Cottage, who goes abroad for information. In his absence,
Buffardo comes deputed by the amorous Monarch to bring his wife to the Royal Haram. Selim,
who is concealed, writes with a pencil, on paper, requesting ber to consent, in appearance—the
obeys, and he, under favour of a female disguise, passes for her, and it conducted in silence to the
Haram, by the stupid BufFardo.—Here the unfortunate General is met by hisfriend Korac.an officer
whose life he had saved in battle, and who, though the confidante of Zembuca, is the warm friend of
his preserver, Selim. The Tyrant discovers his unfortunate victim, and chains him in a dungeon,
from whence the Net-Maker releases him.—Korac makes known to Selim, that Zembuca it an
Usurper, and that he is the legitimate Prince.—Emboldened by this, and distracted with fear for the
safety of Almazaide, who is in the Tyrant's power, he proclaims himself, levies an army, and
advances against Zembuca, whom he defeats, routs his adherents, and establishes in peace the
legitimate Sovereignty.

PROGRAMME.
Frederick the Great, K i n g of Prussia, being out on a hunting excursion (is, through the intricacies
of the Forest) separated from the Noblemen who had accompanied him. .Slight overtakes him, and
he applies for shelter at the house of Moresko, the Chief of the Banditti, who infest the II I . A C It
F O R E S T ; there he encounters Adalbert, who has quitted the army, in disgust, at the abuse of power
and the indignity offered him by his General. They are on the point of taking poison, but are prevented by Rosalie, who informs them that they are in the POVVEIt of A S S A S S I N S , and intreats
them to be on their guard. The Robbers now enter to murder (as they suppose) their sleeping Victims;
but Adelbert, who had been on the watch, stabs F O U R of the R U F F I A N S as they enter. T h e
rest set fire to the house. . The King, Adeibert, and Rosalie nre discovered amidst the B L A Z I N G
R U I N S , from which they escape to the Black Forest. Adelbert is taken by a party of Soldiers, tried
and condemned as a deserter ; but through the interpovt ion of Providence his life is saved. Frederick,
hotting learned the it/juries he has sustained, grants him a full Pardon, and promotes him to the rank
of Colonel of the Regiment fiotn which he deserted. The whimsicalities of Von Groat, the King's
whipper-in, areably ifelineated, and the Piece concludes with the happy union of Adelbert and Rosalie.

TUESDAY.

On TUESDAY, May 24, 1825,
Will be pre.ented, the Drama of

T HOFETHE LADY
ROCK

From the promontory of Mull is to be seen at this day the LADY'S ROCK—a huge
mass,_ visible only at low water, and which derives its name from a circumstance not less
affecting than true, and forms the leading feature of the present Drama.—Maclean, the Lord
of a great Clan in Scotland, conceives the horrid idea of murdering his Wife; and, in order
that no trace may remain by which the deed can be detected, determines on conveying her
to the DREADFUL ROCK, over which, at the returning tide, the sea washes with great
violence, and from which there is no retreat. Urged on by the dictates of the most savage
cruelty, he conveys, places, and leaves her on the Rock, exposed to the merciless and all
devouring waves; but Providence, the guardian of the good, still watches over the lovely
innocent, and she is discovered by a poor Fisherman, who, with the utmost labour and hazard,
rescues the noble victim, and shelters her in his humble hut. Meanwhile, the guilty Husband, not doubting that she must have perished, makes a MOCK FUNERAL, in order to
appease her Clan ; but in this he is deceived. Her Brother arrives at the head of his trusty
followers, and demands to see his Sister dead or alive. In this distracted state the Clans are
about to engage, when the Lady rushes in between £he combatants, reconciles her afflicted
Brother, andin the arms of her repentant Husband forgets the past, and participates the
highest bliss in rewarding her brave deliverer.

On Wednesday E v e n i n g , M a y 2 6 , 1 8 2 © ,
Will be presented, the Drama,

[Preceded by a Vision!
CALLED THE

VAMPIRE;
Or, the Lord of the Isles.
This Piece is founded on the various traditions of the Vampires, which assert, that they
ire SPIRITS, deprived of all hope of futurity, by the crimes committed in their mortal
state; but, they are permitted to roam the earth, in whatever forma they please, with
supernatural powers of fascination—and, that they cannot be destroyed, so long a, t h e ,
sustain their dreadful existence, by imbibing the BLOOD of FEMALE VICTIMS,
whom they are first compelled to marry.
s»y The original idea of this Drama is taken from the celebrated Tale attributed to
Loan BYRON, embodying the various traditions extant, relative to the Vampires, and
forming the following fanciful, effective, and nouvelle Mythology. The Vampires a r .
supposed, in this Drama, to be Beings condemned, after death (for their sins in this world),
to everlasting punishment, with this remission, that they are permitted to roam the earth,
either in their own forms, or the forms of some person deceased, with supernatural power,
of fascination, so long as they sacrifice yearly, before the rising of the last moon in ever,
year, a young and beautiful female, whom they must previously marry, and whoso blood
it is supports their existence. The moon is supposed to possess strange influence over
these terrific creatures; if slain by a mortal hand, and their corses placed so as to catch
the first beams of the moon, on the evening of their death, it again restores them to
existence; there is also, a .pedes 6f Minor Vampires, who are confined to their grave,
all day, and roam at night, sucking the blood of new-born infant, and affianced brides.

BOYS;
OR, THE

CASTLE

OF

OLIVAL.

The Hamlet of Olival, in Provence, is the Scene of this very interesting Drama; it opens

With a Rustic Festival:
The bounties annexed to this Rustic Fete, are proclaimed on the Ann:versary; the humane intention Of
one declares, that " if on the day of the feast, any Orphan, or two Orphans, but no more, and not exceeding the age of sixteen, should arrive as strangers in Olival, they shall, if found worthy of the bounty, be
adopted in the Village, and provided for." On this occasion, two Orphans present themselves by mer.
accident; their peculiar manners and deportment, together with their mysterious account of them•elvej, excite an immediate and minute inquiry. Their History unfold, the basest PERFIDY and
CRUELTY. Sacred Justice interposes, suffering innocence is atoned, remorseless villiany meets its doom,

And the Murderer's means recoil upon himself/

HYPOCRITE.

Jt is a consideration of a truly melancholy nature to look around in this empire, and behold so rait
" n portion of the lower classes of society gradually renouncing the charities and ethics of Christianity, to
embrace opinions which are not only hostile to the main ends of our holy religion, but utterly irrecoacileable to the reasoning faculties of the mind; and. in pursuance of this incxplicabilitv, thousands of
miserable zealots ponder in thought upon points that are entirely irrational until the brain becomes diseased, and then sink from despair to madness, into a dark «nd comfortless grave, where hope hath no
influence 1 All those who are attached in heart and spirit to the furtherance of the doctrines of the
Established Chruch of this country, should lend thf.r aid Id support of every endeavour (whether
theatrically expressed, ox otherwise), that leads to the destruction of those pernicious errors of opinion,
which tend so woefully to undermine and overthrow the fair order of worship, and upraise that hideous
monster, FANATICISM, upon the ashes of reason ant! the true faith.

PROGRAMME.
A rivalry existing between two Forest Hunters, Rodolph and William, t h e former invokes the potent assistance of Zamiel, the Spirit of the Forest, who grant, hiti) SEVEN MAGIC
B U L L E T S ; the properties of which are uncftring aim. For this gift, Rodolph enters on a
compact with Lucifer's agent, ZarnieJ; the period of RolJolph's existence depending only
upon the retainment of the Seventh Ball. Previous to the rising of t h e Curtain, three
Bullets are supposed to have been expended ; the fourth wins the prize of Rangership from
William ; t h e fifth is employed (o entrap him at an Eagle, which is seen to hover in tne air,
at an immeasurable height—William discharges it, and, unconscious of i t , power, brings the
Eagle to the ground—William perceives his astonishment, and taking advantage ofcj.uch,
entices him to the WOLF's GLEN, intending to seduce him to the acceptance of seven
charmed Bullets, the possession of which would bind William as Zajniel's victim, and afford
a new term of life to Rodoiph. The Hoaaoas of WOLF's G L E N are then developed.

had of the honour done him at his last benefit, but that after repeated trials he could not
find words to express his acknowledgments for the distinguished encouragement; and happy

present occasion, to lessen (though hopeless ever to discharge) the vast debt of gratitude he
owes the inhabitants of Nottingham.

To represent which, the whole of the Stage is converted into the

Where the scene of action is principally developed, and from its remoteness from all othe*
communication, the
VESSEL IS SUPPOSED TO' BE THE SCENE OF MANY ATROCITIES,

The novelty of the action being carried on, and conveying the imagination into the midst of
the Ocean, for the portraiture of a very interesting Drama, has made it so attractive in the
Metropolis, that it has already been acted nearly 200 nights.

artifice made use of to delude a faithful servant, that he might accomplish the
atroaious

Acts of Robbery and Murder,
By sacrificing the life and property of his most intimate friend, to discharge his
d^bts of honour—with the means made use of to criminate an innocent person,
and assassinate the only evidence of his guilt. But retributive justice at length
dooms him to suffer an ignominious death, which is miraculously effected by the

Dumb suddenly restored to Speech.

BY T H E REV. R. C. M A T U R I N .
The history of the prediction of this play i. curious. It was sent by the Author, at the recommendalion of Mr, Walter Scott, to Lord Byron, with an earnest entreaty that its fate might be speedily
determined on, as the comfort of his family for the winter depended on it's success, and he offered
it to Drury Lane, wholly, for a very trifling sum.—The Noble Poet read it with such admiration,
that he sent it before he slept to th. other Member, of the Committee, requesting them, if they did not
agree with him in Considering it « most extraordinary work they would forthwith transmit it to the
Managers of Covent Garden, that the deserving author might have the chance of both Theatres for it*
acceptance. It wat cheerfully accepted, and the Noble Lord the same day sent th. author a handsome
present. The Committee sold the copy right of the play for the author at twelve times the price he
asked for it, besides what he obtained by its performance.

_ On a tempesto6u8 night, the Prior and Monks of the Convent of St. Anselm, which stood in a lone
situation, on the shore of the northern coast of Sicily, were roused from their peaceful slumber by the
increasing violence of the storm. One peal of thunder after another burst upon their ear. with an explosion which almost seemed intended to awake the dead; the blue lightning quivered round the walls,
Until relique, rosary, and crucifix, seemed to dance in the unnatural glare. Accustomed as were the
Sicilians to these conflicts of nature, the present uproar startled the boldest inhabitant of the Convent;
one of the Brother, who hid ventured to look abroad rushed in and informed them, in atone of
consternation, that shrieks of horror and distress might be distinctly heard. The Prior ordered lights
t« be displayed on the battlements, and the bell to toll. A vessel struck upon the rocks, and aided
by the lightning, they perceived her deck crowded with despairing mariner..
' ' S H E SINKS! SHE SINKS! wildly exclaim the Monks;" and in an instant the VESSEL
was buried beneath the FATHOMLESS WAVES! The hero of the play with a few of his com.
panious reach the shore, and here commences the story of this important Drama. The melancholy
facts are recorded in the Archives of the Convent of St. Anselm ; and the youths and maidens of Sicily
will repeat the mournful story of Count Bertram and his fearful Adventures in St. Aldobrand's Castle.

Mr. r aimer
Oroonoko :
Has the honour to announce to the Ladies and Gentlemen of Nottingham and its Vicinity,
that his BENEFIT is fixed for

MONDAY next, the 22d of MAY, 1826,
When will be acted, Southerne's clebrated Tragedy of

Or, the IIOYAL SLAVE.

The melancholy story of this unfortunate Prince is truly affecting;, and cannot fail to excite compassion In every sensible and feeling auditor. It not only conveys a strong idea of the galling miseries
tinder which the unhappy victims of the

,

d

SLAVE

TRADE

„h,

are forced to labour, but at the same time to rouse the honest wdignution of every beholder at the instruments of such ignominious wrongs.
OnooNOKo, son of the King of Angola, was invited to au entertainment on board a Slave ship; he went
on board, attended by twenty of his followers, The treacherous Captain, resolving to have him in his
power, plied him powerfully with wine, and after sending most of hi' attendants on shore, took advantage of the state of inebriety to which he had reduced the unhappy Prince, and chained him to the
deck. He instantly set sail for Surinam, where he sold him for a slave. The unexpected meeting with
his wife Imoinda—their unavailing struggle for liberty—the firm attachment and dreadful sufferings of his
friend Aboan—the perfidy of the Lieutenant Governor, who is bent on possessing Imoinda ; to avoid which
She prevails on Oroonoko to put a perod to her sufferings and miseries; which, after a convulsive struggle of
nature and affection, he consents to and presents his dagger to her; hut wanting fortit.de to strike, she
assists him, and plunges it in her breast, the moment the Lieutenant Governor comes on with his Guards
to separate them—Oroonoko rushes on him, and buries his poignard in his heart. He then stabs himself,
anxious tore-gain his loved Imoinda in a better world, where persecution never more can reach them.

A COMIC SOMG BY MR. CARROL.

The whole to conclude with the grand interesting Melo Drama, with new Scenery, Decorations, &c. prepared for the occasion, entitled

The Patriot Swissv
or, the Deliverer of his Country.

J

The ground work of the above Melo Drama, is partly taken from History, and comprises
the successful efforts of the Cantons of Zuriph and Schatf hausen to shake off the Austrian
yoke. The following extracts from the history of Germany, will tend to explain the progress
of the plot,—" The Emperor of Austria, who wanted to govern the Swiss as an absolute
Sovereign, had formed a scheme for erecting Switzerland into a principality for one of his
sens; but finding them tenacious of their independence, he resolved to tame them by rougher
methods, and appointed Governors, who domineered over them in the most arbitrary manner. They were subjected to numberless species of oppression : they were plundered, taxed,
fined, imprisoned, tortured, and even put to death occasionally, without justice or form of
law, and in a word, they groaned under all the miseries flowing from despotic power and
barbarity. In this emergency, they had no prospect of relief, but in their own courage, and
they began to concert proper measures for delivering themselves from the tyranny of the
Austrian government. The Emperor, enraged to find such resistance from a people ha
affected to despise, ordered a numerous army to rendezvous near Constance, which pillaged
the town and village of Schaffhausen; but while they were employed in acquiring booty,
without dreaming of the enemy's approach, the Swiss who htul assembled privately, reconnoitred the enemy's motions, took the opportunity of falling upon them, and cutting them
in pieces."

PROGRAMME:
A rivalry existing between two Forest Hunters, Rodolph and William, the former i n .
Vokesthepotent assistance of Zamiel. the Spirit of the Forebt, who grants him SEVEN M A G I C
B U L L E T S ; the properties of which are unerring aim. For this gift, Rudolph enters on a
compact with Lucifer's agent, Zamiel; t|ie period of Rodolph's existence depending only
>on the retainmcnt of the Seventh Ball. Previous to the rising of the Curtain, three
ullets are supposed to have been expended; the fourth wins the prize of Rangersbip from
William ; the fifth is employed to entrap hiro at an Eagle, which is seen to hover in the air,
at an immeasurable height—William discharges it, and, unconscious of its power, brings t h e
Eagle to the ground—William perceives his astonishment, and taking advantage of such,
fentices him to the WOLF's GLEN, intending to seduce him to the acceptance of seven
charmed Bullets, the possession of which would bind William as Zamiel's victim, and afford
a new term of life to Rodolph. The lioanons of WOLF's G L E N are then developed.

From the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, is engaged for T H R E E

On MONDAYS

October 28d, 1886,

When will be acted, the Meld Drama of

The Miller's Maid.
A. performed at the Theatre Royal English Opera, with the most distinguished applause.
THE story of this Pices is founded on Blaomjield's Poem of the same name, and runt thus :—The Miller
has gathered uudcr his charitable roof, George, a stout lad, who lias been at sea, and, Pbcebe, an orphan, who
has been compelled, by <i;ird treatment, to desert her pSrish apprenticeship, They are mutually enamoured.
Corgi, ha* a rival of a very splenetic temper, his fellow labourer, Giles. The Miller finding that love,
,vith its contomlt-int feudi, does not innch enhance the industry or peace of his household, determines that
Phoebe ihilt'ttrtlarc herself, and choose one of the young fellows for her husband. She of course selects
George, btot Giles exacts a promise that should any Jung prevent their union, he (Gilejj) is to have the next
preference This accident instantly occurs, for the divers, on a comparison of their infantine recollection.,
discover that they have been bred under the tame roof, though they nave been divided and kept asunder by
Varied accidents since the death of their mother. Giles enforces hi. claim, which is, notwithstanding, rejected
by Phoebe, he enters into a conspiracy for forcible abduction of her person with the 'Squire's game-keeper,
whose purpose is to secure her for his master, and leave the obloquy of the deed to Giles. The Orphans
resolve to have all doubts cleared by repairing to their native village. Just as they are about to set
forth, an old soldier arrives, antl encountering Mattie, a booby of strong literary ambition, though unable
to write his name, learns the .story of George and Phoebe, and repairs to the Mill. Mean time Phoebe has
commenced her journey, but without George. Giles is summoned by the game-keeper to his guilty purpose.
The original in Btoomfield is exceedingly beautiful, and its choice simplicity seems to have made a very
happy impression on the fancy of the dramatist. The characters take a strong and familiar Cast, and the
dialogue runs in a vein of spirited and intelligible simplicity. The Piece, on its representation, was received
throughout with the most unequivocal success.

On Wednesday Evening", November 1 , 1 8 2 6 ,
Will be acted, the Tragedy of The

GAMESTER

If there be one vice more pernicious than all the rest of tha black catalogue which debases
humanity, it is that of GAMING To that" pernicious passion this Play is a noble antidote.—The
I esent age is unhappily more distinguished by this than any other pursuit; it infects those most who
are to lead in fashion, and subverts .very generous quality of our nature in its progress.
He, whose ill-luck and deficiency of resource reduce him to the necessity of trick and deception,
when detected, is expelled the company of honourable Gamblers, and reduced to gull inferior
credulity with the manners of the fashionable, and the artifices of a villain.—By degrees, society is
armed against this degraded plunderer—shut out from the haunts which admit every description of
Ruffian but his own, he is driven to unlicensed depredations upon the highway, and in regular

and happiness. It may truly be said," Such Things Are," for an instance at this moment is before our
view In that humane and benevolent chlracter, Mr. Wtbb, who now travels various parts of England,

A story i. recorded, that > young gentleman of the city of London having embezzled part of h i . Master', property, was providentially at a representation of
George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when that admirable actor, M r . Ross, per*
tonated the Character of George Barnwell; at whose fate he was so .truck, that it
occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. T h e Gentlemai ,0 bene*
fitted by this excellent tragedy, was not ashamed to acknowledge his obi: nion,
to the play and the performers, for, at every subsequent yearly benefit, M r . Ross
received =8100. sterling, with a card to the following effect :—
" Dear Sir, one who is indebted to your admirable representation of George
Barnwell, for more than life, for his redeemed honour and credit, begs your a c
ceptance of the inclosed, which sum you will receive en lonjf as you continue in the
line of your profession, Happy am I to acknowledge that the stage has prevented
me from ruin and disgrace. George Barnwell stopped me in my career, ami taved

There is nothing in the whole circle of the Drama, nnlie6t or modern, that can in any way be compared with Hamlet; it stands alone, a class of itself, neither second nor like to any other work of
gamut. Tire common place of criticism, fa rain, would measure out its fault, and beauties—its colossal
greatness mocks all such efforts.—Time, that tries all things, steps forth to vindicate the poet—at the
first touch of his iron hand, these opinions crumble into dust, and, are scattered by the winds of
oblivion, while all his efforts leave not the slightest marks of injury on trie adamant of Shakspeare. No
praise so truly speaks the merit of this admirable play, as that which the poet himself has bestowed oh
his divine CfciorAiaA, " Age cannot wither it, n.r custom stale its infinite variety."

MXSS SMXTHSOK

(OF THE COVBNT GARDEN THEATRE)
Is engaged for T H R E E N I G H T S , — H e r first appearance will be

On Monday Evening, Dee. 4, 1 8 2 6 ,
When will be acted (written by the Rev, R. C, M ATURIN), the Play of

Or the Castle of St, Aldobrand,

The history of the production of this play is curious. It was sent by the Author, at the recommendation of Mr. Walter Scott, to Lord Byron, with an earnest entreaty thit its fate might be speedily
determined on, as the comfort of his family for the winter depended on its success, and he offered
it to Drury Lane, wholly, for a. very trifling turn.—The Noble Poet read it with such admiration,
that he sent it before he slept to the other Members of the Committee, requesting them, if they did not
agree vnth him in considering it a most extraordinary work they would forthwith transmit it to the
Managers of Corwit Garden, that the deseiving author might have the chance of both Theatres for its
acceptance, tt was cheerfully accepted, ami the Noble Lord the same day sent the author a handsome
present. The Committee sold the copy right of the play for the author at twelve times the price hii
asked for it, besides what he obtained by its performance.
On a tempestuous night, the Prior and Monks of the Convent of St. Anselm, which stood in a Ion.
situation, on the shore of the northern coast of Sicily, were roused from their peaceful slumber by the
increasing violence of the storm. One peal of thunder after another burst upon their ears with ad explosion which almost seemed intended to awake the dead ; the blue lightning quivered round the walls,
until relique, rosary, and crucifix, seemed to dance in the unnatural glare. Accustomed as were the
Sicilians td these conflicts of nature, the present uproar startled the boldest inhabitant of the Convent;
one of the Brothers who had ventured to look abroad rushed in and informed them, in a tone of
cunsternati n, that shrieks of horror and distress might be distinctly heard. The Prior ordered lights
to be displayed on the battlements, and the bell ry toll. A vessel struck upon the rocks, and aided
by the lightning, they perceived her deck crowded with despairing mariners.
"SHE» SINKS! SHE SINKS! wildly exclaim the Monks;" and in an Instant the VESSEL
was buried beneath the FATHOMLESS WAVES! The hero of the play with a few of his com.
panions reach the shore, and here commences the story of this important Drama. The melancholy
facts are recorded in the Archives of the Convent of St. Anselm ; and the youths and maidens of Sicily
•till repeat the mournful story of Count Bertram and his fearful Adventures in St. Aldobrand's Castle,

On Friday Evening, Dec. 8 , 1 8 2 0 ,
Will be acted, the popular Drama of

the Orphan of Geneva.

freely translated from the French, altered and adapted to the English Stage, by J. H. Payne, and performed at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, with rapturous applause.
SKETCH or THE STORT.—A presumed Orphan is adopted by the Marchioness of Ligny: who, dying,
leaves her sole beireaa. This enrages every branch of the family, who accuse her of forging the Will,
and assisted by her Advocate (who for his own purpose bttrays her), she is condemned to death, but
makes her escape. All this is supposed to have taken place before the Piece opens : when ThereSe.
under the name of Mariette, has obtained an asylum with the Countess of Morville, who, unacquainted
with her history, consents to her union with her son. The interest of this Piece is formed by the villainous pursuit and persecution of hef enemy, the Advocate, whose ultimate purpose is to many her, and
re-establish her just claims; with this view he follows ber every where to declare Who she is, and de.
rive her of all protection but his own ; and finally enraged at her rejection, and alarmed at her resolve
) denounce him, he determines to murder her. To develope the plot further, would be to destroy in
a great measure chat Interest which this excellent Piece is calculated to excite in its auditory.

Tts conclude with a humourous Farce, called

Below Stairs*

This little piece aims at the reformation of morals. The first to represent, as in a mirror,
to persons in high life, some of their own follies and fopperies, by clothing their very servants
in them, and shewing them to be contemptible and ridiculous. The second and m*re principal aim is to open the eyes of the great, and convince persons of fortune whet impositions,
even to the ravage and ruin of their estates, they are liable to, from the wastefulness and
infidelity of their servants, for want of proper inspection into their domestic affairs. This
farce met with so much opposition from those whosm interest it was to oppose it, that nothing
but the spirited assemblage of the noblemen and gentlemen could suppress; and the consequence was an association amongst them to destroy that scandalous custom of giving TAILS to
SERVANTS, which is the practice of no other nation,.and was long the.disgraee of the united
kingdom, when viiitcd by foreigners.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF

JxAISS MF* JoU JICJiSJLJLi ML
On Friday Evening, tfec. 1#5,1826,
Will be acted (for the first time here), the new Play, written by Miss MITFOBB, as now performing in London, called

FOSCARI,

y

THE DOGE O F VENICE.

The subject of this Play is taken from a domestic tragedy in the History of Venice, and
was suggested to the authoress by an interesting narrative of that event, in D r . Moore's
travels. It may be necessary to say, that her piece was not only completed, but actually
presented to CoVent Garden Theatre, before the publication of Lord Byron's well-known
D r a m a : a fact which happily exculpates her from any charge of a vain imitation of the great
-jtjpet, or a still vainer rivalry—
" Ere his bold tragrdy burst inso day,
Her trembling band bad closed this woman's play."

Will be acted, the Play of

T H E HYPOCRITE.

It ii a consideration of a truly melancholy nature to look around in this empire, and behold
so vast a portion of the lower classes of society gradually renouncing the charities and ethics
of Christianity, to embrace opinion, which are not only hostile to the main ends of our
holy religion, but utterly irreconcileable to the reasoning faculties of the mind; and, in
pursuance of this inexplicability, thonssjids of miserable zealots ponder in thoueht upon
points that are entirely irrational, until the brain becomes diseased, and then sink from
despair to madness, into a dark and comfortless grave, where hope bath no influence! All
those who are attached in heart and spirit to the furtherance of the doctrines of the
Established Church of this country, should lend their aid in support of every endeavour
(whether theatrically expressed, or otherwise), that leads to the destruction of those
pernicious errors of opinion, which tend so woefully to undermine and overthrow the fair
order of worship, and upraise that hideous monster, FANATICISM, upon the ashes of reason
and the true faith.

" T H E FLYING DUTCHMAN" is said to be an Amsterdam Vessel, which about a Century ago
•ailed from that Port; the Master's Name was VAUDEIIDUCKEN, whose constant boast it was, that " He
always would have his own w«y, in spite of fate."
Once, on doubling the Cape, they wer* 4 whole Day trying to weather Table Bay, the Wind Increasing a-bead of them, and Vand«.decken walking the Deck, uontinued swearing fearfully. Just after Sunset, he was spoke by a Vessel, who asked him if hi: did not mean to go into the Bay that Might, to
which Vanderdecken, with a tremendous oath, replied, " He would not, though lie should beat about
till the Day of Judgment." Vanderdeck.n never did go into Table Bay, and is believed to undergo the
Doom he so desperately dared. His W»»el is still seen in the Cape Seas in foul Weather, sailing against
the fiercest Storm, with every inch of canvass set, striving in .vain to reach her home, or to send
despatches to Relatives by other Vessels.—The hints upon which the Drama is founded, were taken
from a short and interesting Article in Blackwood's .Magazine, from whence also the above account it

•On Friday Evening, October &, 18&7,
WILL BE ACTED, T H E TRAGEDY O f

George Barnwell.
Thi.affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to
the riling generation, was founded on fact. T h e unfortunate hero of the piece was
executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable uncle, in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth ; to which he was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned Woman.
Step b y step she led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a
miserable existence by the most ignominious death.
A story is recorded, that a young gentleman of the city of London having embezzled part of his Master's property, was providentially at a representation of
George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when that admirable actor, M r . Ross, personated the Character of George Barnwell; at whose fate he was so struck, that it
occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. T h e Gentleman so benefitted by this excellent tragedy, was not ashamed to acknowledge his obligation,
to the play and the performers, ft*", at every subsequent yearly benefit, M r . Ross
received =£100. sterling, frith a card to the following effect :—
" Dear Sir, one who is indebted to your admirable representation of Georg.
Bartiwel!, for more than life, for his redeemed honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the inclosed, which sum you will receive so long as you continue in the
line of your profes'ion. Happy am I to acknowledge that the stage has prevented
me from ruin and disgrac \ George Barnwell shipped me in my career, and saved
m e fr'oman ignomin ous death. I am your friend and servant, *' A C O H V U R T . "

In Conjunction with many others, they make their escape and boarding a richly-laden vessel, bound to the

they are wrecked on a rock of Loadstone, called the MAGNET ROCK, where every soul is supposed to
be lost, Peter and Adam;, being expert swimmers, gain the land, which they find to be a most fertile one,
abounding in lake, stored with fish, forests of game, fruits, and rivulets of the purest water. The ship,
De la Crux, being forced on the sands by the powerful attraction of the rock, all her lading remains
strewed on the shore: Peter and John exploring their way, come to that part where she inlying ; they

THIRTY YEARS OF

A {Gambler's Life an
OB, T H E

Red Hut of the Mountain.

The frightful picture which this piece draws of a gambler's life, though given in the very strongeit
'colour,, is by no me^nsovercharged. I t d es not exhibit the slow and minute gradation, by which
the infatuations of the naming table lead its wretched votaries from the comparative innocence of the
novice in p'ay to the deep villainy of the old and practiced gambler. It takes a better course. I t
selectsa single instance—exhibits a young mnn just entering into life, and ensnared amongst a set of
gaming (harper, —S'IOWS him agai i at the end of fifteen years, when we find him a confirmed gamester, disdaining no trick, however mean and dishonourable, to supply the means of, gratifying his
insatiable pissinu, reflArd'ess Qf 'ho tnisei-y which he is bringing on nit around him. j n fifteen years
farther, we see. instead of the gay and dashing man of fashion, mix ; ng i .ill the pleasures of the day
but making them all subservient to his dnrling passion, we find a wretched outcast from society, banished from the luunts of men for his crimes, and, at last, when other resources fail, not stopping at
even the crime of MURDEK, to supply the wants which his previous folly had created. The picture is
not one of imagination, THB REALITY OP SUCH A SCENI WA* s u r r n i D i s A BREADKUL INSTANCE A FEW

*' This Melo Drama commences at a period when WALLACE having cleared Scotland of King
Edward'* troops, returns triumphant, and as a reward for bis many eminei t services, if, by the general Vflic.juf.lto Nation, declared Regent of Scotland. This act, however, lays ifcirfqutntetion of
Wallace'., ruin—for the ancient Nobles murmuring, that one of obscure birth should wield a
Sovereign.'* power, hi secret determine to crush the new sprung Regent, and to thii end they lay a
plot, the execution of which they defer till a fit opportunity should offer Thus far the author has
adhered to history ; but the second act abounds with the molt interest ing situations in which the life
of Wallace is frequently in the most imminent dinger ; to detail the incidents'WouM tie to deprive
them of their ioterest: it must suffice to say, that from the constancy of Helen, the cunning of Allan
Kirauay, the loyalty of Maddeiina, the daring conduct of Kirkpatrick, the Hero is saved, and the
villain MoBteith having failed in his treachery, meets with that punishment which should ever attend

THIRTY YEARS
"OF A

Gambler'sLife
OR, T H E

Red Hut of the Mountain.
The frightful picture wblqh this pi.se draws of a gambler's lift, though given in the very strongest
colours, is by no means overcharged. It does not exhibit the slow and minute gradations by which
the infatuations of the itatT.ii.,' table lead Its wretched votaries from tho comparative innocence of (he
novice in play, to the deep villainy of the old and practiced gambler. It takes a better course. It
selects a .ingle instance—exhibits a young man just entering yHo life, and ensnared amongst a set of
.{anting sharper,—shows him ag»i i at the end of fifteen years, when we find him a confirmed gamester, disdaining no trick, however mean and dishonourable, to supply the means of gratifying his
Insatiable p.ssion, regardless of the misery which he is bringing on all around him. In fifteen years
Sfertbtr, we see, Instead of the gay and dashing man of fashion, mixing in ah the pleasures of the day
bat making them all subservient to tin. duritag passion, we find a wretdieJ outcs-t from society, banished from the haunts of men for his crimes, and, at last, when other resources fail, not stopping at
even the crime of MURDER, to supply the wants which his previous folly bad created. The picture is

Act drop, at the rehearsal, and don't hesitate to pronounce MAarLur, full as Inquisitive, and ccmmically unfortunate, as the umbrella-bearing Paul Pry. I'll just tell you the charaelers and their
representatives:—Iu the first place,
Marplot (a Gentleman who is always dropping into hobbles, by-wishing to know the secrets of every
famliy), Mr. COOPER.
, Sir George Airy (a Gentleman of fortune, who prove, " a friend in need, is a friend Indeed"),
Mr. F l t E E R .
Sir Francis Gripa (a doatingold Miser, deservedly duped), Mr. ROBERTSON.
Sir Jealous Traffic (atesty old Gentleman), Mr. WOODLEV.
Charles (son of Sir Francis, professing more love than money)
Mr. CROLEY.
Whisper (a Servant extremely smart end impudent). Mr. CA RIIOL
Butler, Mr. H O L L A N D Cook, Mr. ADDIS.—Vulet, Mr. CULLEN.
Miranda (an interesting Lady, Who affects dumbness, with a great deal to say for herself 5,
Mrs. MANLY.
Isabinda (a young Lady, not partial to Spanish education), Miss JOYCE.
Patch (a Chamber-maid, as saucy and impudent as such maids generally me), Mrs. L E E .
'
Scrubwell, Mrs. SIDNEY.
Now between you and me, there may be another character or two, such as a servant or so—" but
that's no business of mine."—I would tell you all the incidents, but I'm afraid you'd think it Ms
intrusive, and besides, " it might go further."•-•Between you and me, I should',it wonder at there
Uoing a good house, " I would'nt intrude." but for myself I shull go early.—I'm afraid I've kept
you some time readinj» this bill j but now I wish you very good morning, afternoon, or evening, suit
your own time. " I hope I don't intrude," but should it happen to rain that night, don't stay »>•»>,
but bring your umbrella with you.
End of the Play,

HESTJ"

BY MR. JOSEPH WARD, O F NOTTINGHAM.
At the solicitation of Mr. Robertson, in order to introduce a Kaloskcnetecknephu.Utinion, or
PANORAMIC SCENE of the

Battle of Navarlno

It would have been a reproach to British Artists, if no attempt had been made to transfer the great
and leading features of this battle to the canvass. The pencil may preserve what the pen cannot describe. Too much cannot be done in honour of our brave countrymen. The Scene displays the round
stem of Admiral Codrington's ship, the Asia, which is lying between the Egyptian Admiral's ship and
the Turkish Admiral"., who has the main boom of the small tender of the Asia hung tn her stem pore,
to board which the Turks made strenuous efforts, without success. On the other side is represented
the fire ship blazing, which the skill and bravery of Captain Fellows turned off. In perspective are
seen the several ships in action.—No engagement ever afforded a stronger proof of the prodigious,
superiority of European science over ignorance, enthusiasm, blind desperation, and Turkish obstinacy. •
Want »f fidelity received a just punishment.—The effect of the red lire will be displayed on this
Scene, with bombs, red hot balls, ike,

ground in safety—speaks in her sleep of the desertion of Edmund, who now convinced of hefftoocenee,
places the ring tm her finger, and nouses her. An explanation takes place, and Ernestine, with, a cry

In the country of Bohemia, on the borders of one of those extensive forests so favourable to the desperate
excursions of a Banditti, the author of this interesting melo-drama hasfixedthe Miller and his Men.—
The Miller, from being a menial servant in the family of Count Friberg, rise, by unknown mean, to be
the master of rich aad excensive possessions.—The apparent source of this wealth is the aroduce of his
mill; but under the disguise of an honest employment, the Miller and his Men are engaged in the most
atrocious acts, and the mill is in reality the receptacle of plunder, and under it are extensive Caverns, in
which are concealed a Banditti, th« terror of Bohemia. Wolf vunder the assumed name of Grindoff t h .
Miller) is their Captain.— tearful of detection, and dreadful in revenge, he flies beneath the Mili a Maga»
arfne of I'awder, that in the event of discovery, it may sacrifice with himself his pursuers. The Piece i .
well imagined, and the scenes follow with much interest, and has been performed with the greatest
success at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden.

OF

THE

LAI&EB I

OR, THE BROWNIE'S BRIG.
In the present age, when the rage for Melodramatic performance has in n great measure outrun, and
even in the principal Metropolitan Theatres, entirely superseded the legitimate Drama, none amongst the
incalculable number that has issued from the pens of the candidates for dramatic fame has proved
more successful, or more richly merited the public approbation, than the Wraith of the Lake : the story
is most interesting, and the incidents of the drama so quickly succeed each other, that the limits of a
programme will not admit of their detail without becoming tedious to the reader. An ancientand hereditary
feud betwixt the clans of Mac Pberson and (.rant, caused continual strife, which was not confined to the
leaders, but rankled in the breasts of the most dependent vassal of each Laird. The domains of these clans
lay neur each other, and were only parted by the brig of A rran, one of those alpine passes which frequently
are found in the Northern parts of Scotland, and the neighboring Islands. Mac Pherson and Grant were
returning borne, they met on the brig mid-way—they were hereditary foes—that one might pass, the other
must needs turn back— both refuses—they glared on each other a look of hate and defiance—they east
their eyes on the wide abyss below-- gazed on the torrent, and each pointed crate'— then foot to foot they
stood—one prayer, one sigh for home, and they clutched in the embrace of death ! Not a breath was
drawn—not a word was spoken—the slightest slip was mortal. Mac Pherson was bold and brave—his
murderer subtle and strong—he drew from his bosom a knife, and as they paused for breath, he darted on
his unsuspecting foe, and plugged it in his side—the dying grasp of Mac Pherson was terrible—but his
strength flowed from him with his blood — one more struggle, one more sigh, and he was hurled over the
rock! His murderer watched his fall—listened lo the death-cry—beheld him dash from peak to peak,
till even his screams were lost in distance : he fell a shapeless mass of blood—but the winds of heaven
brought his groans to ring in the assassin's ears for ever!

FOR THE BENEFIT OF
MR. and MRS.

SIMPSON.

Mr. SIMPSON in announcing his Night, respectfully solicits the kind
patronage of his Friends and the admirers of the Drama, assuring them,
that he has exerted his utmost zeal in getting up Pieces, which he doubts
not, will give general satisfaction, and therefore humbly hopes for a
share of their favours.

On Monday Evening-, J u l y 4 , 1 8 3 1 ,
Will b* acted (for t h . first time here), the admired Drama of

J o h n Overy,
The Miser of South wark Ferry. *J

*

John Overy (or Overt, a. he is in mine places, called,) lived abont the eleventh century, and rented the terry of South
wark, before a bridge wai built acrosi the 1 hanics. He was a wonder of penuriousness, and eventually owed hi. death to
hi. passion for gain ; for believing that, should he counterfeit death, his apprentices would forego their scant provisions for
the day, he suffered himself to belaid out at one who had departed this life. Hit apprentices, however, rejoicing at the
demise of the miser, assailed the cupboard, when Overy arose, and one of hit men mWtaklng his master for a spectre, struck
at him w<th the but end of an oar, and killed him on the spot. The Baron Fitzgtffrey's passion for the miser's daughter—
th* lovely and piout Mary—his wooing her In the ciuracter of his own falconer, that he may be loved for ' himself alone,'—
hit tempting and trying her through the medium of his rank and wealth, are dramatic and effective ; to too is the honest love
and disinterested fidelity of the rejected Stratbolc;—much interest hangs about the orphan Grandchild of the miser ;—
hi. cruel expulsion—gratuitous patronage by the half-starved Bosk, hit assignment to Mayfly, &c. but it is not adequately
gratified—the episode of the dissipated gallants, Mayfly and Parroquet, are well imagined; their needy ventures chime well lu
with and are necessary to the story ; their robbing the brother of the miser, Wolstand, and his companion Baldwin, at
Canterbury, on their return from a long sojourn in foreign climes, and pledging part of their property with the miser himself,
aud the various circumstances consequent on it are also happily conceived.

of his situation, the combined loss of all held most dear on earth, a loving wife (who had shared with hira
the perils of a long and arduous voyage) and his infant child; he is en the point of plunging into the
Ocean to bury his woes in dark oblivion, when he perceives his Chest floating on the waves, which inspire*
him with the hope, that the boat in which his beloved wife and child may have met with the same interposition of providence, he rushes out, determined to search every creek and corner of the shore. The arrival of
the L o n g Boat, with the objects of his search, accompanied by Ben Bluff, Tim Trudge, and a party of
Sailors, who discovering Manton's name fresh inscribed upon a rock, are overjoyed, and immediately follow
their leader, Ben Bluff, in search of their late commander. Falling in with a party of Indiiins, who have
landed on the Island for the purpose of hunting; a terrific combat ensues, in which the Indian Chief is overcome by Ben. Hence, the foundation of this interesting piece, which interspersed with the sagacious tricks
of the; Monkey, the whimsicalities of Tim Trudge, and the malignant revenge of the Indian Chief, render
Jt one of the most popular pieces of the present day.

Will be presented, the popular Tragedy of

Or the London Apprentice,
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rislne r e n m t . « „

A story is recorded, that a young gentlema. of the city of Lendon having embezzled Dart of hi.
Masters property, was providentially at a representation of George Barnwell, at Drurv Lane when
that admirable actor, Mr. Ross, personated the character of George Barnwell; at whose fate he was
jo struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman to benefitted
by this excellent tragedy, was not ashamed to acknowledge his obligations to the play and the ner
formers, for, at every subsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Ross received rflOO. sterling, with a. card to the
following effect s— .
" Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell for more
than life, for his redeemed honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the inclosed, which sum you will

This Piece excited more interest with the Drury Lane audience than any of the kind ever produced.
The story is as follows:—A war of nearly twenty years had been waged between the family of Hernhausen and that of Count Conenberg; the chance of war left the Count at the mercy of the haughty
Baron, who demanded, as the price of peace, his daughter Amelia in marriage; she shuddering at the
thought of being united to a man the despised, and driven by despair, as was supposed, suddenly left the
Castle, and was never heard of till the death nf the Count—at this period the Piece commences. The
'oung Count having taken possession of his Castle and Estate, learns that Amelia, instead of being a vo.
uiuary fugitive, was carried off by the Baron, and being determined to avenge her death, declares war on
him, who, finding he could ill support this unexpected warfare, sends his Esquire and comrades to
surprise the young Count, and under a specious pretence, allure him into his garden, where there is a fine
picturesque grotto, with a subterraneous passage, leading without the walls, into which, after overpowering, they convey him.
ACT 2d opens with the interior of a Cottage, the asylum of Amelia, who is grateful to Heaven for even
that miserable abode, rendered more dreary by the loss of her foster mother, when a noise is heard and
they are obliged to admit the triumvirate and the young Count their prisoner. After several incidents,
Amelia succeeds in composing the desperadoes to sleep, by infusing a potion in their wine, and escapes
cautiously with the Count and Maria; the noise of a storm wakes them—Schampt is knocked down by
the lightning—the Cottage is struck by a thunderbolt, when part of it gives way—in a second after, the
whole falls and discover* the river; and the Count, Amelia, and Maria in a boat, are seen by the lightning
violently tossed by the waves—the ruffians grope their way over the ruins in pursuit.
I ACT 3d opens with a Forest at night, and the Woodman's Hut; the ruffian's pursuit—the honeit
Woodman's rough answers to their enquiries—his nephew's assistance—the Count and Maria, losing
Amelia in the Forest, seek shelter in the Woodman's Hut—Moritz locks them in, and goes in search of
Amelia, who enters pale and in disorder. She rushes to the Hut and finds it locked—calls for assistance,
.iii. drops faintiug at the door. The Count, unable to force the door, appears at the window with arms,
which hefiresas the ruffians are going to seize her; Schampt I. wounded, and levels his pistols at Amelia,
whom. Kaunitz has seized—the Count, rendered desperate, leaps from the window, and attacks the
ruffians, whilst Moritz deliver. Amelia, and puts her in the Hut. Wolfender had ordered the Forest to
be set on fire in every direction—Amelia is seen at the window when the Hut begin, to blaze—the door
is forced by the Count and Bruhl, when Amelia and Maria run out and fly to the bridge, and passing
through the flame., a part of it falls, and the fugitives remain in safety on the unbroken part of the bridge
i-ipressingjoy and gratitude, whilst Wolfender and his ruffians ARE: CAUGHT IN THEIR OWN
SNA HE, a THIS IS drops in FULL BLAZE, which cuts off all communication, and they are left to the
VILLAINY deserves.

(Founded on Sir:WaLTER S C O T T ' S Novel under that n»me,)
Thin Piece has met with the mow unbounded applause, and is justly entitled to the success it
has so eminently met with. The interest the situations of the different characters create, is equal,
not to say surpassing, any etory ever dramatised. The mystery is so admirably kept up throughout, a* to keep the beholders in the most anxious suspense till the fall of the curtain ; while the
comic part* assist to lighten the Play, making at ouce the most complete Drama aver produced.
An extract from a London Newspaper, upon it, says, " Tears and laughter testified much more
forcibly than any other mode of applause could do, how completely the sympathy and satisfaction
of the audience were excited,"

Scene in David Deans' Cottage,

Between the Sisters, Evrn and JIANH, and proceeds progressively to the arrest and imprisonment of the former,—'The interesting interview at Midnight between Jeanie and Staunton, on

Oft.

The Bravo of Venice.
T h e story of thii extraordinary and interesting piece, took its rise from a Prince of Milan's being
disappointed by a lady whose hand he bad sought; who, on the point of marriage with him, preferred
a neighbouring prince, merely for his superior power and splendour, which caused in the despairiug
over so great a disgust towards the sex, that he resolved never to unite himself to a woman who would
not be faithful to him under every circumstance.—In pursuit of this prodigy, he is led by chance to St.
Bertrand's cave, where he finds Carlo Foscari (the Duke of Venice's near kinsman), murdered by
banditti, but before Foscari expired, he pledged to him a solemn oath, that he would revenge his death.
T o effect this, he joins the banditti, which he finds to be five in number ; among them he learns there
i . a plot ripening in Venice, to overturn its Constitution and change the system of Government, Having
received all the information that is necessary, he fulfils the oath made to the murdered Foscari, by
causing the wretches who perpetrated the horrid act, to be delivered up to public justice, which Didoes under the name of Flodoardo, an enterprising young soldier of fortune j under which character
also he attracts the notice of the Duke, and becomes enamoured of his daughter Rosabella; but true
to the resolution he had formed, of proving the faith of the woman he would unite his destiny with,
tries her affection for him under a variety of characters and situations. For this purpose he affixes a
notice to the palace gates, containing these remarkable w o r d s : " the banditti who suffered yesterday,
have left a sixth behind them, whose single arm equals those of the other five. Ye who need my
dagger seek roe! As a proof of my skill, let St. Bertrand's Cave be searched ; 4 twas t h e r . 1 stabbed to
the heart the senator, Carlo Foscari.
From the biavo Rugantiuo," Under this character he has
the happiness to prove the constancy of his mistress, and to defeat the project, of the conspirators, who
meet with the reward due to Treason, while the country is restored to happiness and tranquillity.

JOCONDE

This Comedy, a translation from the French by the mott popular of our modern Dramatists, M r .
Uoncrcift, may without egotism he said to exc I even the original of MODS. Etiuniie, entitled " Joconde
ou les Coureurs d'Aventures," which has so long been the admiration of the French Capital. On its
first introduction in London, it was performed at every Theatre with the same success, and continues
to be what it ever must remain, a decided favutiriie. The comicality of character and incident throughout .iiiini fail to eicile risibility in the highest degree, whilst its happy termination leaves even the
mosi fastidious critic nothing to co.dcum or wish for.

To conclude will, the Romantic Drama of the

RORRER'S

WIFE.

This romantic drama is a tale of crime, sorrow, and remorse; the hero and heroine, the once gay Mark
Rsdland (Mwdock the Robber) and Rose Briarly, erst the pride of the Village (the Robber's Wife.)
Alas! how
Ranged their appeaiance and condition—their complexion stained, their hair dyed —the miserable tenants of a
^-etched hovel, bearing the resemblance of an inn, to lure the unwary traveller to plunder and outrage. T h e first
• <ime of Rose was disobedience ; her father, to retrieve her ruined fortune, had journeyed to a far country, leaving
. daughter in the care of an old friend in defiance of duty, she married his bitterest foe, the man who had
o j b e d him, and who, (though she knew it nol) was an outlaw and a felon—and Rose becomes the passive agent
:
-• her husband's crimes, the sharer of his confidence and guilt, without having lifted the dagger against the de• -olcss stranger. Murdock is the chief gang of coiners, among whom is Sawny Mackfile, whose vocation is
ih*t of a guide, to decoy unwary victims to the Fox and Goose—Travellers are on the road ; one a stranger, resting to his native village, after a long absence ; Murdock immediately plots his murder, when, to the horror of
we, she discovered the intended victim to be her father! Filial piety induces her to resort to various expedient*.
f.r his safety—draws the pistols with which they intend to perpetrate the murder—Murdock snaps the unloaded
pi-,tol—shots are fired from without—the robbers have fallen, and the grateful father is restored to his penitent
'nil,,.

" A rich example of simplicity occurred to delight the audience at Dniry Lane, on
one of the Nights during the representation of The Rent Day,
Amidst the pathos of
the ' distraining scene,' when the Farmer was telling the legal harpies, in the accents of
despair, to T A K E A L L , a worthy individual in the Pit started up, and with the most
emphatic commisseration, offered a t'20. note from his own pocket, to stay the course
of proceedings. This burst of mistaken generosity produced no little sensation on the
beholders. The enthusiastic philanthropist was, however, pacified ; and I eadbeater, the
officer, was privately stationed in his vicinity, to prevent the crafty attempts of any
possible claimants for the twenty pounds, under the assumption of authority from the
supposed suffering party."

study of Chaldaic, Hebrew, Arabic, and Celtic Dialects, for the foimation of a Prize Lexicon, Eugene
Aram, to obtain a trifling property, concerted with an acccomplice, Richard Houseman, and with his
own hand, effected the violent death of one Daniel Clarke, an artizan of Knaresborough, in Yorkshire.
Por nearly FOURTEEN YEARS the secret slept with the victim, in the depths of ST. ROBERT'S
CAVE, till the accidental digging up of a Skeleton in the neighbourhood, led to a full discovery. Aram
was seized and arraigned—the gifted homicide was found" tuilty, and after an imperfect effort at
suicide, PERISHED ON THE SCAFFOLD!

- " A rich example of simplicity occurred to delight the audience at Dairy Lane, on
one of the Nights during the representation of The Rent H(U/. Amidst the pathos of
the ' distraining scene," when the Farmer was telling the legal harpies, in the accents of
despair, to TAKE A L L , a \vorthy individual in the Pit started up, and with the most
emphatic commisseration, offered a L'20. note from his own pocket, to stay the course
of proceedings. This burst of mistaken generosity produced no little sensation on the
beholders. The enthusiastic philanthropist was, however, pacified; and Leadbeater, the
officer, was privately stationed in his vicinity, to prevent the crafty attempts of any
powible claimants for the twenty pounds, under the assumption of authority from the
supposed suffering party."

LONDON A P P R E N T I C E .
Thi» affecting Tragedy,- the moral tendency of which ha« been »o beneficial to the rising gehefcrtltjtij

was founded on fact. The unfortunate hero of the piece was executed for the murder of his virtuoo,
and venerable uncle, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; to which he was instigated by an artful, cttielj
and abandoned Woman,
Step by step she led the Unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable eaist.,
ence by the most ignominious death.
A story is recorded, that a young gentleman of the city of London hating embezzled part 6f hit
Muter*, prdperty, was providentially at a representation of George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when
that admirable actor, Mr- Ross, personated the character of George Barnwell; at whose fate he wai
,o struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman so benefitted
by this excellent tragedy, was not ashamed to acknowledge his obligations to the play and the per*
formers, for, at every jubsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Ross received sClOO. sterling, with a card to the
following effect:—
" Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, tot ttlore
than life, for his redeemed honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the inclosed, which sum you will
receive so long as you continue in the line of your profession. Happy am I to acknowledge that the
•tage has prevented me from rUin and disgrace George Barnwell stopped me in tny career, and saved
in« from an ignominious death, I am your friend and servant,

I

The affecting story of this most excellent Tragedy being founded in fact, and every circumstance of
it literally true, nothing was wanting but an author of eminence to do justice to the subject. Ithappily
fell to the lot of Mr. Howe, who has so far succeeded in his endeavours as to have written one of the
best Trngedies on the subject in the English language. The spirited aeai of Hastings in supporting tlia
honour of his Sovereign-—the tenderness of Dumont, in disguise, tohis wife, Jane Shore—-and the wicked
hypociisy ofGlo'ster (afterwards Richard I I I . ) are most admirably described. The violent jealousy of
Alicia, and the miserable death of Jane Shore, who dies of hunger in the streets, are likewise, so happily
represented, as to give every fueling and susceptible mind an evening's treat of the most rational entertainment.

EUGENE ARAM"
Or, ST. ROBERT'S CAVE.

y

The facts connected with the remarkable name of Eugene Aram are briefly these;—In the memorable year of the Scotch Rebellion, 1743, being then a Teacher In a School, and deeply engaged In the
study of Chaldalc, Hebrew, Arabic, and Celtic Dialects, for the foimation of a Prize Lexicon, Eugene
Aram, to obtain a trifling property, concerted with an acccomplice, Richard Houseman, and with hi,
own hand, effected the violent death of one Daniel Clarke, an artizan of Knaresbof ough, in Yorkshire.
For nearly FOURTEEN YEARS the secret slept with the victim, in the depths of ST. ROBERT',
CAVE, till the accidental digging up of a Skeleton In the neighbourhood, led to a full discovery. Aram
was seized and arraigned—the gifted homicide was found guilty, and after an imperfect effort at
•uicide, PERISHED ON THE SCAFFOLD!

T h e whole to conclude with the Mclo D r a m , (presented by.a Vision) called The

be Lord of the Islel.
T h i s Piece is founded on the v .rious traditions of the Vampires, which assert, that they are SptMTJj
deprived of all hope of futurity, by the crimes committed in their mortal state ; but, they are permitted
to roam the earth, in wh*!.*eT firms they please, with supernuural powers of fascination—and, that
they cannot be destroyed, so long as they sustain their dreadful exigence, by imbibing the B L O O D
of F E M A L E V I C T I M S , whom they are first compelled to marry
$y T h e original idea of thin Drama is taken from the celebrated ['ale attributed to Load B Y R O N ,
embodying the vaeiou. traditions exrant, relative to the Vampii eft, ami forming the following fanciful,
effective, and nouvelle Mythology. 'I'he Vampires are supposed, in this Drama, to be Beings condemned, after death (for their sins in this world), to everlasting punishment, wirh this remission, that
they are permitted to roam the earth,either in their own forois, or the forms of some person deceased,1
with supernatural powers of fascination, so long as they sacrifice yearly, before the rising of .he last
moon in every year, a young and beautiful female, whom they must previously marry, and Whose
'blood it is supports their existence. T h e moon is supposed to pns,ess straUge influence over these,
trrrific creatures; if slain by a mortal hand, and their corses placed so as to catch the first beams of
the moon, on the evening of their death, It again restores them to existence, there is also a tpecieu
of Minor Vampires, who are confined to their graves all day, and roam at night, sucking the blood
of new-born infants and affianced brides.

A DANCE BY MISS S I B E R Y .

HiEI The Performances to conclude with, for the first time at this Theatre, an entirely new seriously, affecting, pathetically heart-breaking, agonising and subduing, terrific, horrific.
-——
shriek-creating, boisterous, gloriously mysterious, uproarious, any thing but ridiculous, burlesque, extravagan-ical Burietta, to be entitled and called

Blaek-Ey'd
.Sukey;
ALL IN THE DUMPS.
The drama concocted (Anglice written), devised, arranged, conceived, imagined, and put to paper by the author of the " Elbow Shakers." aided and assisted on this
particular occasion only, by his particular friend, Mr. W I L L I A M SHAKSPEAKE, late of Stratford-upon Avon, a gentleman already favourably known to the public, from
having gained some ferae in the literary world, as the author of a volume of poems, " Hamlet," a tragedy, and other works. The Manager has great pleasure in thus publicly acknowledging the readiness with which he consented to get into the " Omnibus," and come post haste to Nottingham, to assist in the production of a " Rara Avis"
in the annals of dramatic literaturo. The musical arrangements of the piece are on the most extensive and grand scale .- it is to be hoped they will not prove a bar to the
amusement of the audience, or afford occasion for any sharp person to say they an flat, because they consist of well-known and admired airs. The gentlemen expressly
retained for this department, and who will introduce themselves to the notice of the public iu the course of the evening, are, Henry Bishop, John Barnett, Thomas Haynes
Bayley, Alexander Lee, George Herbert Rodwell, aud Charles Horn, Esquires, not to mention a whole host of talent, centred in the person of Mr. Rolfe, composer to
the Theatre. The dresses attended to before dinner, by Mr. Grindeli; the decorative embellishments done after dinner, but before wine, and the properties looked up
between tea and supper, by Mr. Casson; and the burlesque action of the piece, get up under the immediate superintendence of Messrs. Nanta and Boddie, wl .ook
neither breakfast, luncheon, dinner, dessert, tea, nor supper, having incessantly devoted day and night in the production.
•' For us and for our tragedie,
Beseeching your kind cternencie,
We beg a hearing patiently."—The Gentleman from
Stratford-upon-Avon.

T H E historical fact, upon which this intensely interesting Drama is constructed, may be
found in the various Histories of London, but more particularly in the Chronicles of Stow,
&c.
Strange as it may appear to the many,—to this circumstance we are chiefly indebted
for our Coroner's Inquest, by which j i o person suspected of coming by his death mysteriously, or by improper means, can be buried, without a.Tury of his Countrymen have first.de.
cided upon the nature of his death. " The W i f e , " says the Legend, " t h r o u g h the i n .
stigation of her seventh Husband, was apprehended, tried, and found guilty of petty treason, and was burnt to death in Smithfield ; and so great a noise did this story make, that in

The MAT*RIEi< of which thi5 Piece is composed, is derived from a fact which occurred
some time since, at a lonely ale -house an the borders of some of the dreary marshes, near
the Sea Coast of Essex. The means which were resorted to by the mischievous offender,
were fortunately discovered in time to prevent further mischief, than the destruction of the
nervous system of the unhappy wights, who were the subject of his nocturnal visits. He
was brought to justice, and an ample punishment was the award of his roguery.
The principal incidents with which this piece abounds, are in the following succession;
Inordinate love of play, and a run of ill luck compel one military hero to fly from the
clutches of John Doe and Rt4.iard Roe.—Msirmony the only alternative—-a gaol or an
heiress.

A Thicket by Moon-light.
Council of war-.-Rapid promotion in the army..-Steeple chase on foot in swampy ground,
by no mean* conducive tot he renovation of clothes.

A Room in the Pig- anil Whalelione.
Comfortable quarters in a rough ni^ht-«-L'U^e orders-.-Small rettirns---Inconveniencies of
changino-clothes without money to chan.e...Prospect of a damp field bed-.-In the midst of

A T H U N D E R STORM

Midnight approaches---E*rited terrors at the expected visit of the dreaded Apparition-'
Military aid called in.--The Storm increases—1 he imna'es in three beds.

T h e Clock strikes Twelve.
A crash of appalling sounds is heard---Terror pervades every heart, when the

Ghost ol J e r r y Abersliaw hung- in Chains,
Makes his awful visitation.

Terrible Denunciation €>f the Spectre.

(XEW-YEARS EVE,)
Will be performed, the admired domestic Drama of the

MILLER
OR T H E

SAILOR'S BRIDE.

This entertaining little Drama, from the pen of John Fawcit Saville, has deservedly been the
admiration of the dramatic world, both for its moral influence, and the truly rustic beauties,
which it is so ably calculated to pourtray. •' 'Twas on a summer's eve, and near the hour of
rest"—a gathering storm approached the humble dwellings of a peaceful village. The Miller
and his Dame seated in their elbow chairs, with eyes fived on the hearth—their thoughts did
wander to those without a home. The Dame did take her husband's hand, and looked upon his
face—he took his pipe, and strove to hide it in the smoke. The storm beat louder—a scream
was heard—the Miller dashed his pipe upon the ground—the sound was heard again—they
dropped upon their knees, and begged ol Heaven to guide the wanderer to their door. Their
prayer was heard—an orphan Girl, with feeble step, and garments drenched in rain, essayed
their threshold—her fainting voice asked mercy at their door, which opened at the sound.
They caught her in their arms, and from that hour, the Orphan Child no longer sought a home,
but found a shelter in the Miller's humble cot.

PAUL
THE

POACHER 9
OR T H E

ASSASSIN LAlfOUHftER.

A subject to come home to the bosoms of men, must needs be of a domestic nature. Th*
truest sympathy is excited by characters and events, that come under the general observation.
The hero of this truly affecting Drama, the once happy Paul Copsley, having been injured (as
he conceives) by Squire Stapleton, vows to be revenged. Cherishing the baneful passion in
his breast, it leads him on from crime to crime, until we see him degraded—loaded with chains
—and accused of the dreadful deed of Murder ! The guilty and horror-stricken husband, t o gether with the heart-rending grief of an almost broken-hearted Wife and Daughter, render
this the most interesting of domestic Dramas.

The Tragedy of Hamlet is a production of such celebrity, we cannot do better than quote
some of Dr. JOHNSON'S observations on it. He says, that if " the Dramas, of Shakspeare
were to be characterised,' each by tlje particular1 excellence which distinguishes it from the
rest, wo must allow the Tragedy of Hamlet the praise of variety. The incidents „are so
numerous, that the argument of the play would make a long tale. The scenes are interchangeably diversified with merriment and solemnity—that includes judicious and instructive
observations ; and solemnity not strained by poetical violence above the natural sentiments
of man. New characters appear from time to tittle, in continual succession, exhibiting
various forms of life and particular modes of conversation. The mournful distraction of
Ophe'ia fills the heart with tenderness; and every personage produces the effect intended,
from the apparition that in the first act, chills the blood with horror, to the Fop, in the last,
that exposes affectation to just contempt."

ZEMBUCA:
Or, T h e Net-Maker and his Wife.

Zembuea, King of Persia, is a turbulent Tyrant, who oppresses all within his influence. He conceives a criminal passion for Almassaide, the betrothed wife of his friend, General Selim, of whose
valour and popularity he feel, jealous; to remedy this, he dispatches him on an expedition against a
powerful body of insurgents, with promises of instant support. The succours are purposely withheld, which occasions the defeat of his General, and which Zembuca uses as the base pretext for his
disgrace and banishment. Selim is proscribed, and a reward offered for his head. The persecuted
fugitive finds shelter in the Net-Maker's Cottage, who goes abroad for information. In his absence,
BufTardo comes deputed by the amorous Monarch to bring his wife to the Iloyal Harem. Selim,
who is concealed, writes with a pencil, on paper, requesting her to consent, in appearance—she
obeys, and he, under favour of a female disguise, passes for her, and is conducted in silence to the
Harem, by the stupid Buffardo.—Here the unfortunate General is met by hisfriend Korac,an officer
whose life he had saved in battle, and who, though the confidante of Zembuca, is the warm friend of
his preserver, Selim. The Tyrant discovers his unfortunate victim, and chains him in a dungeon,
from whence the Net-Maker releases him.—Korac makes known to Selim, that Zembuca is an
Usurper, and that he is the legitimate Prince,—Emboldened by this, and distracted with fear for the
safety of Almazaidr, who is in the Tyrant's power, he proclaim, himself, levies an army, and
advances against Zembuca, whom he defeats, rout, his adherents, and establishes in peace tbe
legitimate Sovereignty.

On Monday Evening, June 15, 1835,
Will be presented, the celebrated Play of

THE E X I L E ;
Or, The Deserts of Siberia,

*~

The Scenery painted by Mr. Murray.
This interesting and successful Play is from Madame Cottin's celebrated French work " Elizabeth,
or the Exit, of Siberia." The story, language, sentiment., and striking situations are closely copied
from this excellent original, which has been universally read and admired throughout Europe, and has
been translated into almost every modern language. Were the narrative merely the creation of fancy, it
would be considered as affecting a fiction as ever met the public eye; but as it is generally known to be
founded on truth, and to be actually an embellished fact, tenfold sympathy is naturally excited by it.
dramatic representation. The heroine of this piece was a character that really existed in our own time,
—who undertook a painful and dangerous journey of some thousand miles, over trackless snow, and
inhospitable deserts, to throw herself at the feet of her Sovereign at her Coronation, and Implore the
pardon of an honourable but exiled father. The Queen generously granting a parent's freedom to the
ardent supination of his duteous child ; thu9 rewarding filial piety, and exerting the best prerogative of
Royal Clemency, the power of pardon. The heroic character of Daran, the unwearied Champion and
Protector of oppressed innocence, heightens the serious interest of the Piece, while the pathetic
admirably blended with the comic, and most animated music sheds brilliance and hilarity over the whole
of this varied and »nK>rtaining Drama.

A SONG BY M R S . H O W E L L .
The whole to conclude with the Melo Drama entitled T H E

Swiss P a t r i o t
Or, The Deliverer of his Country.

The ground work of the above Melo Drama, is partly taken from History, and comprises
the successful efforts of the Cantons of Zurich and Schaff hausen to shake off the Austrian
yoke. The following extracts from the history of Germany, will tend to explain the progress
of the plot.—" The Emperor of Austria, who wanted to govern the Swiss as an absolute
Sovereign, had formed a scheme for erecting Switzerland into a principality for one of his
sons; but finding them tenacious of their independence, he resolved to tame them by rougher
methods, and appointed Governors, who domineered over them in the most arbitrary manner. They were subjected to numberless species of oppression: they were plundered, taxed,
fined, imprisoned, tortured, and even put to death occasionally, without justice or form of
law, and in a word, they groaned under all the miseries flowing from despotic power and
barbarity. In this emergency, they had no prospect of relief, but in their own courage, and
they began to concert proper measures for delivering themselves from the tyranny of the
Austrian government. The Emperor, enraged to find such resistance from a people he
affected to despise, ordered a numerous army to rendezvous near Constance, which pillaged
the town and village of Schaffhausen; but while they were employed in acquiring booty,
without dreaming of the enemy's approach, the Swiss who had assembled privately, reconnoitred the enemy's motions, took the opportunity of falling upon them, and cutting them
in pieces."

FOR THE BENEFIT OF
MR. AND MRS. HOWELL.
On Thursday Evening, June 2 5 , 1835,
Will be performed, the popular Tragedy of

George Harnwell
Or, The London Apprentice.
Thi, affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which ha. been so beneficial to the rLing generation,
was founded on fa^t. The unfortunate hero of the piece wai executed for the murder of hi. virtuous
•nd veneribte uncle, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; to which he wa. instigated by an artful, cruel,
and abandoned Woman.
Step by »tep she l^d the unwary youth to the list cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence by the most ignominious death.
A story is recorded, that a young gentleman of the city of London having embezzled part of hi.
Master's property, was providentially at a representation of George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when
that admirable actor, Mr. Ros«, personated the character of George Barnwell; at whose fate he Wll
•o .truck, that it occasioned hi. immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman so benefitted
by thi. excellent tragedy, was not ashamed to acknowledge hi. obligation, to the play and the performers, for, at every .ubsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Ro.s received .6100. rterling, with a card to the
following effect:—
" Dear Sir,—One whn is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, for mora
than life, for his redeemed honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the inclosed, which »um you will
receive 10 long as you continue in the line of your profession. Happy am ( to acknowledge that t h .
stage ha. prevented me from ruin and disgrace. George Barnwell .topped me in my career, and saved
me from an ignominious death. I am your friend and servant,

IJI

HI'

The rightful Laird of Glencairn, having been reported to have fallen in the wars, assumes the
name of Mat o'th' Glen, and in the garb of misery, becomes the terror of the neighbourhood.
Andrew (an old Fisherman, and faithful adherent to the house of Glencairn), reluming from his
occupation, is surprised by the appearance of the Warlock, who imperatively commands Andrew, at
T H E A W F U L H O U R CUP T W E L V E ,
to meet him on the moor—he reluctantly consents, and the Warlock departs satisfied with his promise,
Rustic festivities are here performed, which are interrupted by the frantic exclamations of the Countess,
craving protection for herself and child, from Clanronald (the supposed assassin of her husband), who
determines on leading her to the altnr, and destroying the child.to prevent his claims affecting the
title of Laird of Glencairn (which he has usurped.)
A d e l b e r t ( t h e child), is t o r n f r o m i t s m o t h e r , a n d b o r n e a w a y b y t h e R u f f i a n s :
meanwhile the Countess, to avoid the obhurred ehibraces of Clanronald, flies his presence, and
P r e c i p i t a t e s h e r s e l f f r o m a h i g h r o c k i n t o t h e S e a — A n d r e w is s e e n i n h i s b o a t ,
endeavouring to rescue her from t h e waves.
The Ruffians appear with the child—its supplicative innocence, contrasted with the ferocity of the
villains, forms a most affecting scene ; they are on the point of murdering the child, when it is preserved
by the interposition of Andrew—Andrew has the interview with the Warlock,at the " Hour of
Twelve."—A variety of incidents succeed, but to enter into a further detail would destroy the
interest of the Piece.

FIRST NIGHT

T H E GOOSE FAIR.
On Monday Evening-, October 3,18.3O,
Wilt be acted, the celebrated Play of The

STRANGER:
Or Misanthropy anil R e p e n t a n c e .
" W h o b y R e p e n t a n c e is n o t s a t i s f i e d ,
" I s n o t of H e a v e n o r E a r t h . "
The play of " The Stranger" has rivetted the attention, drawn the tears, and excited the applause of the
public during many years. A more amiable picture of repentance was never exhibited on the stage;
nd of the many who have witnessed the representation, not one but roust have hailed the denouement
with the most pleasing emotions. The character of the Stranger isfinelyimagined; he is a misanthrope
ot by nature, but by circumstance : he had trusted and had been ritally deceived ; and having suffered in the very near and dear relations of wife and friend, he became disgusted with mankind, and
resolved never to trust more; his heart, however, is not wholly shut up against kindly feelings. His
meeting with Mrs. Haller, is very ingeniously contrived, and the eventual reconciliation is quite coniitent with an interview so extraordinary and interesting.

F I F T H FAIR NIGHT.

Will be performed, the fashion a ble and exeellent Play of T h e

HYPOCRITE

A . a c t e d b y h i . la*e M a j e s t y ' s c o m m a n d .
" When caps in<° a crowd are thrown,
" Each nw» w n a t ^ t 9 l" m f c a " s his own."
'This Comedy, originally the TABHIF* 1 E OF MOLIERE, first translated and adapted to British
habits by CIBHE'R, and subsequently assuming its present form and name, under the skilful
revisal of BICKERSTAW, has, in all its various applications, been found an useful antidote to
the cowardly and contemptible vice, which is the object of its satire. But, although ranking
high in public estimation, in the several ages, the circumstances of which it has moulded and
re-moulded to meet, at no period has it been more popular than the present; for crowds have
thronged to witness its oft repeated representation; and even his !ate Majesty condescended
to mark his opinion of the justice of its censure, by commanding its performance. Perhaps
such a play as the HYPOCRITE was never so necessary, nor such satire as it contains, ever
so provoked as at the present moment; for at no former period did sanctimoniousness make
so formidable a stand against TBDE religion; never before were such fearful inroads made
upon the comforts of civilized life, by crafty pretenders to holiness; nor ever were the morals
of the poor, and the pockets of the rich, in such peril, from ignorant and cunning traffickers
in RELIGIOUS HYPOCRISY. The Stage does not presume to interfere with creeds and consciences, it does not set itself up as a theological dictator; but vice, in every form, is a fair
mark for the dramatic satirist,—
A n d t h e D r a m a does a r e a l service t o society, w h e n it hold* u p t o scorn a n d
contempt, t h e jobber in righteousness, t h e pious pilferer, or, i n one w o r d T H E
HYPOCRITE.
We live in an age of religious speculation; and it depends upon the present generation,
whether eur children shall be, as our fathers were, cheerful and rational Christians, or, gloomy
and intolerant asceticks. For under the influence of the new light, all is darkness; the
harmless pleasures of life, are denounced as deadly sins; the gaieties of youth, and the social
enjoyments of age, are called criminal backslidings ; and the mental amusements, which the
wise and virtuous have honoured and approved, are anathematised as the work of DAEMONS.
Mockery would be superfluous on a subject so essentially abused, but that a large portion of
society, especially in the humble walks of life, is tainted with THIS L O A T H S O M E
M O R A L C O N T A G I O N , THIS L E P R O S Y OF THE M I N D : and although no human
laws can reform the evil, although the deluders and deluded are beyond the grasp of
legislative enactments, yet they are within the reach of RIDICULE, and are sentitive enough
to SHRINK F R O M ITS P O T E N C Y .
