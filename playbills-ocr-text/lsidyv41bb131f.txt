T H E G R A N D DRAMA OF

Obi, or Three Finger d Jack,
Is founded on a Matter of Fact, which occurred in the Year 1780, in the bland of Jamaica.
O illustrate the Mysteries of OBI, and the Character and Exploits of THREE F I N G E R ' D JACK, a Work
lately printed, has furniflied the following E X T R A C T S :
** The Science of Obi is very extenfive—This Obi, or as it is pronounced ih the Englifli Weft Indies, Obeab,
has its Origin, like many Customs among the Africans, from file Ancient ./Egyptians' Obi, for the Purpofe of bewitching People, or consuming them by lingering Illncfs, is made of Grave Dirt, Hair, Teeth of Sharks, and other Anir als—
Blood, Feathers, Egg-fJiells, Images in Wax, the Hearts of Birds, Liver of Mtte, and fome potent Roots, Weeds,
and Bufhes, of which Europeans are at this Time ignorant.—A Negro, who thinks himfelf bewitched by Obi, will appl)
to an Obi Man or Obi Wnmm for Cure, The most wrinkled and molt deformed Obian Magicians are the most venerated,
Speaking of an horrible Clafs of Negroes, the Author of the Work alluded to fays, " fome of thefe abandoned
Exiles live in Spite of the common Law of Nature, and furvive a general Mutation of their Mufcles, Ligaments, and
Osteology; becoming alfo hideouflv wh'ite h> the'r woolly Hair and Skin,"
In their Banilhtnent, their Huts often become the Receptacles of Robbers and fugitive Negroes. Thus, thefe ugl)
loathfome Creatures are Oracles of Woods, Caves, and unfrequenied Places, and are reiarted to .Secretly, by the wretcha.
in Mind, and by the malicious for wicked Purpofcs."

T

THREE FINGER'D JACK,
The learned Author of the Work we have profited by, fays,—
• I faw the Obi of the famous Negro Robber, Three Finger'd Jack, the Terror of Jamaica, in 1780.—It confirtee
of a Goat's Horn filled with a Cotppound of Grave Dirt, Allies, the Blood of a black Cat, and human Fat, all mixed
into a Kind of Paste; a Cat's Foot, a dried Toad, a Pig's Tail, a Slip of Virginal Parchment of Kid Skin, with Characters marked in Blood on it, were alfo in his Obian Bag, Thefe, with a keen Sabre, and two Gun?, were all hi
Obi; with which, and his Courage in defcending into the Plains, and plundering to fupply his Wants, and his Skill In
retreating into difficult Faftneffes, among the Mountains, commanding the only Accefs to them, where none dared fa;
follow him, he terrified the Inhabitants, and let the Civil Power and the neighbouring Militia of the Ifland at Defianc
for near two Years.—He had neither Accomplice nor Affociate. There were a few runaway Negroes in the Wood
near Mount Lebanus, the Place of his Retreat, but he had crofled their Foreheads with fome of the Magic in his Horr..
and they could not betray him. But he trusted no one—he fcorned AJfiftance. He afcended above Spartacus herobbc •
alone—fought ail his Battles alone—and always killed his Purfuers. By his Magic, he was not oflly the Dread of tji
Negroes, but there were many White People who bdieved he was poUefletJ of fonie fupernatural Power.—At Len«I
allured by the Rewards offered by Governor Dalling, twoNegioes, named Quatnce and Sam, both of Scot's m l >,
Maroon Town, went in Search of him—Qiufhee, before he fet out on the Expedition, got himfctf christened, an I
changed hi'. Name to James Reeder. They took with them a little Boy. Thefe three f<;on difco. ered, by Impreflion
among the Weeds and Bufhes, that fume Perfon must have lately been that Way. They foftiy followed thefe Impref
fions, making not the lezft Noife.—Prefcntly they difcovercd a Smoke,
' They came upon Jack before he perceived them—he was roasting Plantains by a little Fire on the Ground, -ar
the Mouth of a Cave. Jack's Looks were fierce and terrible ; he told them he would kill them.—Reeder replied that hiObi had no Power to hurt him; for he was christened, and that his Name was no longer Quafl.ee.—Jack knew Reeder
and as if paralyfed, he let his two Guns remain on the Ground, and look up only his Cutlafs.—Thefe two had a fever.
Engagement f-veral Years before, in the Woods, in which Conflict Jack loft the two Fingers, which was the OriginV
his prefent Name.—Without further Parley, Jack, with his Cutlafs in his Hand, threw himfelf down a Precipice at the
Head of the Cave.—Reeder's Gun miffed fire—Sam fliot him in the Shoulder—Rfedery. like an EngKfh Bull Dog, nevelooked, but with his Cutlafs in his Hand, plunged headlong down after Jack.—Here was a Stage, on which two'of th
stoutest Hearts-, that ever wtre hooped with Ribs, began their bloody Struggle.—The little Boy, who was ordered to kcc.
back out of Harm's Way, now reached the Top of the Precipice, and during the Fight (hot Jack in the Belly whic
occafioned his Death.
• Sam came up just time enough to fave Reeder; for Jack hid caught him by the Throat with his Giant's Grafp—
Reeder was wounded, and Jack, streaming with Blood from his Shoulder and Breast, and both were covered with Gor
and Gaflies.—In this State Sam was Umpire, and decided the Fate of the Battle.
' The little Boy foon after found his Way to them: He had a Cutlafs, with which they cut off Jack's Head an '
Three Finger'd Hand, and took them in Triumph, followed by a vast Concourfe of Negroes, now no longer afraid ( :
Tack's Obi, blowing their Shells and Horns, and firing Guns in their rude Method. In this Manner they proceeded to
Kingston, and claimed the Rewards offered by the King's Proclamation and the Houfe of Aflembiy.

Years of Age is found capable of sustaining the full Weight of Characters, which call forth all the Powers
of the most established Actors of the present Day: Ljqndon (and its Host of Critics) is filled with Wonder
and Astonishment at the Talents and superior Merits of the Young Roscius, yet Talent and Merit are not
confined to him alone—Miss L. SWINDAL (only eleven Years of Age) will appear in one of Master BETTY'S
princip.il Characters. The Public is respectfully assured, that this is not announced merely for the Attraction ot a Night, but should she answer the Expectation of those who have already seen her perform in private,
it is intended to pursue the Plan upon which the London Roscius started, and several Engagements are now
making for her at the Theatres York, Hull, Doncaster, and Warrington, for that Purpose : To the Decision of a candid and liberal Audience she rests her future Prospects in the theatrical World.

The followingflcetchof the ftory will clearly evince how very interesting and truly affecting are the incidents of
this admirable Play.
Durimel, a foldier in the fervice of France, having been provoked toft,ilcean officer, deferts from hia regiment, to avoid
the puniiTiment which awaits fo glaring an infringement of the laws of military fubordi nation. He is fortunate enough to procure mercantile employment in the houfe of a widow lady, on the borders of Switzerland, and an attachment to her daughter
Bertha, who returns his paffion, is in a ftiort time the confequence. - T h e manly integrity of the young foldier induces him to
' difcover to the mother, the predicament under which he lies j the particulars being overheard by a difappointed rival, he communicates the circumftance to the officers of the French regiment, at that time quartered in the village.—The unfortunate lover
is immediately apprehended as a deferter. The Point of Honour is maintained by Durimel, in refufing to efcape when in his
power, and in refitting the Major's entreaty to avail himfelf of the favourable opportunity.—He will rather die than difgrace
his father's charafter. An awful and folemn military preparation now takes place for the execution of Durimel—They proceed
to the fatal fpot—the handkerchief is bound round the head of the intended viftim to martial law, and the muflcets are levelled
to their objeft —The'father endeavours to give the fignal, hut his refolution wavers, and he finks under the overwhelming
agony of his fenfations.—A thought inftantly occurs—he gives the word of command, and inftantly rufhes before the body of
his fon.—Every one is thrown into the utmoft confternation—the relationlhip is difcovered, and the deferter receives a full
pardon for his offence.

ON F R I D A Y EVENING, J U N E 7,
Will be presented the favourite Tragedy of

George Barnwell,
OR THE L OND ON

'PRENTICE.

Since the firft Inftitution of the Theatres to the prefent day, no Dramatic Piece has been of more service to society than this
admirable Play ; and if to point out the allurements of vice as a. warning to unthinking youth to avoid the fnares of debauchery
be the bufincfs of the Stage, its power has never been more juftly or more effectually exerted.—The crimes and misfortunes of
the unhappy George Barnwell are held up as an awful Monitor to Youth ; and, amongst other inftances of the great influence
of ftage effeft over the paftions, the following anecdote is a lading proof of its fafcinating power, both to improve the morals
and mend the heart.—In London, fome few years ago, a young gentleman in the mercantile line, hid, in an unguarded moment,
made free with a confiderable fum of money, the property of his employer. Chance that evening directed him to Drary-Lane
Theatre, where the performance of Mr. Rofi, in the character of George Barnwell, ftruck his mind Co forcibly, that felf-conviftion attended by fevere remorfe, compelled him to replace the money fo difgracefully obtained, and by a life of rtrt-ft honour
and probity ever after, he amply atoned for a temporary deviation from the rules of virtue.
" I've heard that guilty creatures, fitting at a Play, have, by the -very cunning ofthe /cent, bccnjlruck to the foul,
that prefently they have proclaimed their malefaiiions.—Shakespeare.
So fenfible was this gentleman that to the Theatre alone he flood indebted for this happy change, he ever after prefented Mr.
Rofs, on his benefit-night, with an Hundred Found Bank Note for a Ticket, and conftantly acknowledged his obligations to
this excellent Play ; a Play that will ingraft fuch excellent principles in young minds, as to conduce to their future happinefi
through the pleafing medium of a rational entertainment,—where inftruftion is fo blended with amufement.

Mr. Dimond, in his Preface to this Play, says " The Popularity which the " The Doubtful

" drawn from my Port Folio to the Stage. Each Theatrical Critic, whose opinion possesses any
" esteem in Society, has individually published his commendation of the Play ; I should therefore

On TUESDAY Evening, J U N E 11, 1811,
Will be acted the celebrated Play of

Alexander the Great,
OR RIVAL QUEENS.
In a political point of view, there is no period in the history of mankind to highly interesting as that which
forms the basis of the celebrated drama to be exhibited this evening. The long contested .struggle for superiority between
Persia and the united power of Greece was, at this memorable epoch, terminated, through the extensive political arrangements
of Philip of Macedon, and by the daring heroism of his son and successor, ALEXANDER—in the total subjugation of Asia,
by which the balance of power, political, civil, commercial, and literary, was transferred to Europe; and which ascendancy
lit has ever since retained. Alexander, whose magnanimity, generosity, heroism, and expansive genius, have crowned him
with the title of" GREAT," is here represented returning from the conquest of all the known parts of the Eastern world !—
Persia, Egypt, and India. ELEVATED ON A CAR OF VICTORY, drawn by conquered Princes—crowned with Laurels—surrounded by his Generals—and welcomed with Hymn, of Triumph, the Hero enter. Babylon. Alas! how weak are
the greatest minds t—At all times fiery and impetuous, in the rage of wine, he murders, at a banquet, his preceptor in war,
his best friend, the preserver of his life, Ciytus. How uncertain are the height, of human power!—Pursued by the furious
jealousy of the Queen Roxana, who had formerly possessed his vows; driven to distraction by the idol of his heart, his beloved
Satira, who receives her mortal wound in the boner of Semiramis, by the frantic hand of the jealous Roxana; caught in the
toil of envy and of treason, with which two of his Generals, Cassander and Polyperchon, enclose him: poison i. administered
to him at the banquet, and he falls as he lived, unconqueted by pain, comforting hi. weeping friends, and bequeathing the
empire of the world (in the iftemorable words recorded by Plutarch) " TO HIM WHO IS MOST WORTHY."

Tat* most excellent P)ay is taken from that Part of English History in which victorious Edward III. besieged Calais; though
repeatedly repelled, the British Hero with unwearied Constancy, regardless of Toil, Danger, and Death, pursues his Purpose,
and ultimately succeeds in reducing i t ; after the Garrison had made a brave Defence for eleven Months, Edward, enraged at
the endoring Obstinacy of the Inhabitants, refuses to grant them any but the following Terms, viz, •* That six of the principal Citizens carrying the Keys and bare-headed, witn Halter,- round their Necks, shall be delivered up for Execution."—But
the Arrival of his Consort I'hillipa, who generously intercedes for those unfortunate Wretches, gives a happy Turn to the
Catastrophe, and prevents the warlike Edward from sullying the Glory of his Arms.

SCENES.—In Act 1, a strange kind of howling is heard,—Orson presents himself with an animal in his grasp, which he
has just slain; a faint roar is heard of the old Bear—Orson expresses satisfaction, intimating he has got food for her—
The Bear enters; Orson shews her the food, and in a playful maimer follows her into the cave.—Valentine and Hugo
enter; a roar is heard from the cave, Hugo instantly returns running, most whimsically terrified, and pursued by Orson—
Rugo runs off.—Valentine re-enters, cannot find the wild man, and mounts a tree to look out for his enemy—Orson
re-enters-Valentine plucks a branch, and throws it at him—Orson, enraged, immediately ascends the tree, and while
lie is climbing up outside, Valentine gets down on the other: Orson makes but one jump from the tree to the ground—
Valentine slightly wounds Orson with the point of his sword, at which he, enraged, looks round for a weapon, pulls
up a young tree by the roots, and uses it as a club—A fierce combat ensues; Valentine, by his lightness and activity,
escapes many dreadful blows, aimed at him by Orson—They stand to bieathe awhile, when the Bear suddcdly totters
from the cave—Valentine, at the moment she opens her mouth, presents his sword in the attitude of thrusting it down
her throat; Orson, n3 if matmctively appri^d «f the danger of his foster-mother, drops his club, and seems to implore
mercy for the old and feeble Bear-Valentine retires, the Bear follows—Orson recovers his club, and is about to attack
Valentine, when the latter cuts Orson s hand; the club falls, and Valentine is once more attacking the Bear, when Orson
supplicates—Valentine suddenly throws a cord round Orson's hands, and bids him follow him, Valentine holding the
other end of the cord—Orson looks at the Bear, and tlicn at Valentine, who throws him fruit; he gives it to the Bear;
Vsleiitine gives him wine from aflask,he tastes it, likes it, and gives some to the Bear, who seems half strangled with it,
•nd totters towards the caye.-Valentinc again bids Orson follow him; Orson suddenly snaps the cord, and follows
the Bear-the ^ear, unable to reach the cave, drops with a faint roar, and dies, as if from old age ; Orson shakes

himself and the Bear seems pleased.and overcome by it-presents Valentine with one end of the cord, and holding the
other, suffers himself to be led off, looking back from time to time at the dead Bear, and making an uncouth and
mournful kind of lamentation.In Act 2, Valentine enters the Court-yard of tho Palace of Orleans, leading
Orson, who seems amazed at every thing around him.—PAVILION OF THE GREEN KNIGHT: the Green
Knight enters in armour;; he offers Lady^Florimonda his fond, which she rejects, and shews him these words, embroidered on a scarf-- Flonmonda mil wed the Knight who frees her from Agmmant." He threatens, and strikes
the scarf from her hand; she falls op he* knees m despair-a trumpat is sounded without; Agramant orders it to be
answered-Eglantine enters and offers to fight with hhn-they fight; she is overthrown. The Green Knight is about
loput her to^death when \alentme. rushes on, discovers Eglantine, and fiercely defies Agramant, who, in derision,
bids him try to pull down th«slueld from the tree; when Valentine approaches the shield, a Safacen Priest interposes,
and speaks-" forbear! this shield protects a Prime not nursed by woman!" Valentine persists, tnid encovmtersthe.
fcreen Knight with battle-axe, broadsword, &c. Valentine is worsted; Orson rushes on, and begi to fight Agramant.
Valentine recolle.ts the words of the priest, and bids Orson try to pull away the shield, which he is about to seize,
when the priest again says-" Forbear! this shield protects a Prince not nursed by woman!" Orson, not retarding
him, approaches the shield, and it flies into his hand; the Green Knight, forewarned of his fate, rushe* on Orson in
savage desperation but every weapon breaks on the enchanted shield-Orson strikes Agramant to the ground-thunder is heard, and the Genius Pacolet »s scen-lie comes forward, and addresses the Characters, and declares Orson
to be endowed with reason-Orson approaches Florimonda-she rejects him ; he looks at his uncouth figure and dress,

FOR T H E BENEFIT OF

On F R I D A Y Evening-, MARCH 11, 1814,
Will be performed, (not acted here these Twenty Year*) the Historical TRAOEDY of

HENRY II.
OR,

THE

Fall of Fair Rosamond
IJV WOODSTOCK

BOWER.

.

T H E subject of the above Play is one of the most interesting we have in the History of England. King Henry
the Second, after the fatigue of the Chace, accompanied by the Earl of Huntingdon and the Baron Clifford, is invited by
the latter into his Castle in the Forest, to take some refreshment. The King there sees Rosamond, and is enamoured of her
beauty. After his departure he quits his train, and, subdued by the unconquerable passion of love, returns to the Baron's
Castle, ascends the garden wall, finds Rosamond, woos, wins, and persuades her to elope with him. Clifford, missing his
daughter, pursues her, but not recovering her, he throws himself into Godstow Priory, and determines to become a Monk.—
At this period our Author commences his Play. The Queen, by her secret emissaries .it Court, finds she has a rival in the
affections of the King, and is fired with rage and jealousy at the discovery. His Majesty, well knowing the disposition of
Queen Elinor, and dreading the consequences should she know of Rosamond's concealment, has a bower so artfully constructed at Woodstock, that no human power can discover it; but stung with remorse at seducing the daughter of his friend,
reveals it to Clifford, the supposed Monk, hfoiming him likewise, that onh by a silver clue he can discover the

B O W E R OF F A I R ROSAMOND.
Clifford reveals it to the Abbot of Godstow, who, conceiving an inveterate hatred to Henry, and well knowing the disposition of the Queen, informs her of the mode of access to the bower. In the mean time the Abbot sends Clifford (the supposed Monk) to persuade Rosamond to tuke the veil and quit her retirement, which to induce hei to do he discovers himself
lo be her father — The Queen, now informed of the clue to Fair Rosamond, brings a BOWL OF POISON, compelling the
unhappy Rosamond to drink, which she does to avoid being STABBED.—The King returns to the bower just time enough
to receive the parting breath of his BELOVED ROSAMOND, who expires lamented by all, the vindictive Queen herself
not excepted.—

Raymond having completed hi" studies, is entreated by his Father to begin his travels;—sets out, accompanied by
Theodore, his faithful domestic. On entering the confines M the Forest of Roseuwold, night draws on, he loses his way,
and by the treachery of his guide, Claude, he is led to the cottage of a woodman, Baptista, the Captain of a Banditti, who
assumes that disguise more securely to commit his depredations on the unwary traveller. Robert and Janues, sons of Baptista,
return from their plunder in the forest, and enter armed. Raymond is conducted to repose himself in n chamber— Baptista
and sons lay a plot to murder him Margurette, in order to put Raymond un his guard, contrives to place a pillow st.ined
with blood on his bed. Robert enters the chamber and attempts the murder, but is pre+enled by Raymond's caution.
Agnes aud her Govemaute now enter the cottage, being benighted in their journey to the Castle of Lindenburg. Raymond,
enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her; and Margurette giving him' to understand the wine is an opiate, lie pretends
to drink, and affects to sleep. The murderers thinking their victims stcure, leave them to Baptista, who is preparing to.
assassinate Agues, when he tweets his dentil by the very dagger he had raised against sleeping innocence,—Margurette now
points out the secret door, by which they escape.—Raymond conducts Agnes to the Gastle of Lindenburg, and is received
by the Baron and Countess (the onlv surviving relations of Agnes) with much attention. Raymond observes several portraits
of a Nun with a wound in her breast; enquires her history :—>

Agnes relates the Story of the Bleeding Nun ;
And tells him 'tis reported the Spectre haunts the Castle every fifth year.—Raymond declare, his passion for Agnes, and is
dismissed the Castle.—Agnes is told the intention of the Countess in sending tor* her to the Casile is to seclude her tor ever
from the world. Terrified at the idea, she determines to rely on the honor of Raymond's affection—she drops a letter from
the turret, in which she tells Raymond
" K fun the Castle Bell tolls One,'
" Expect me as the Bleeding Nun !"
Raymond, enraptured at the idea of seeing Agnes, keeps his appointment—the Bell tolls One—the Cast], Gates fly open—and

THE APPARITION OF THE BLEEDING NUN
Is pursued by Raymond. Agnes as the Nun, now appears, aud looks in vain for Raymond- she is mel bv Theodore, and
takes his prolection—they are uirprited bv the Banditti. Agnes t-nnfiwed in a cavern bv Robert, J.upies and Claude—She

THEATBE, WOLVjERHAMFTON.
On WEDNESDAY Evening MARCH 16, 1814,
Will be presented, the much-admired PLAY of

The Point of Honour ;
OR, THE

NOBLE

DESERTER

DURIMEL, a Soldier in the Service of France, having been provoked to strike an Officer, deserts his Regiment, to avoid the punishment which
awaits so glaring an infringement of the laws of military subordination. Duiimel has not seen his Father many years; and the latter, in consequence of his gallant and meritoiious services, has risen from an inferior situation in the army, to the fank of Major in this very regiment. He
was one of the Counsel who examined the youth, felt himself bound to join in pronouncing sentence of death upon him, and is appointed to give
the fatal signal at the moment of executioti ! The complicated distress of a parent thus situated, must be obvious to every mind ; the meeting
between the father and the son, m which the cognition of their mutual affinity takes place, is a scene of affecting and highly-wrought tenderness.
The remainder of the play is chiefly occupied in depicting the struggle* between a sense of duty and parental affection, which agitate, the breast
of the Major, and the ilistress of Durimel, every moment expecting to be summoned by the guards—agonized by distraction of hi, beloved
Bertha, and overcome by the deep affliction of his father. The bursts of grief and passion flowing from the perplexities, are intermingled with
occasional sentiments of consolation, fuititi.de, philosophy, add religion. The Point of Honour is maintained by Durimel, refusing to escape
when in his power, and in resisting the Major's intreaty to avail himself of the favourable opportunity. He would rather die than disgrace his
father', character. They proceed to the fatal spot, the handkerchief i, bound round the head of the intended victim of martial law, and the
muskets are levelled at the object! The father endeavours to give the signal—his resolution wavers, and he sinks under the overwhelming agony
of his sensations. A thought suddenly occurs to him—he gives the word of command, and instantly rushes before the body of bis Son! Every
one is thrown inW the utmost consternation , the relationship of the parties is discovered, and the Deserter receives fall PARDON.

and Acting Manager, fulfilled his various duties, in the latter capacity by impartially conducting the Business of the
Theatre, and being most strenuous to render the Performances worthy of the Public's Attention, he hopes to meet tltf
general Support of the Friends of the Drama.

T H E BLACK

PRINCE:

OR, THE,

Conquest of F r a n c e !
AT THE MEMORABLE BATTLE OF POICTTERS,

Where the renowned Edward, with only a handful of troops, and opposed bv1 a host of foes, obtained a complete am! glorious
ctory.—At a moiitent so interesting as the present, when France appears again upon the point of being conquered, bv the
osts of valiant troops who already possess many of her most fruitful province;—when the immortal WELLINGTON and
BRITISH ARMV, after the most brilliant Achievements upon French Territory, are in* triumphant march, the vanquished
agles of France flying before them—wlien the next arrival may inform us of her Capital being occupied by her invaders
ider the veteran BLUCHER or the gallant PRINCE of SCHWARTZENBERO, and of the Downfall, perhaps Captivity,
f her unprincipled Tyrant—the Theatrical Representation of the CONQUEST of FRANCE in days of old, and by a
'-ritish Hero, it is presumed will be an acceptable Treat to a Wolverhampton Audience; particularly so, as the day (the
1st of MARCH) is the Anniversary of a glorious VICTORY obtained by British Prowess in another Part of the World,
a the sultry Plains of EGYPT—wheie Frenchmen were again taught that we inherit the Valour of our Ancestors, and
heu our ABERCROMBY fell in the moment of Glory.

rustrated in his design, Don Guzman enters with his intended son-in-law, Ferdinand, who, after the manner of the Spaniards,
erenades the Lady Donna Anna at her window. Dun Juan quarrels with and kills him ; by the assistance of his man,
Scaramouch, he now enters the house of Guzman, and steals to the apartment of the Lady, who alarms the family ; Don
luan kills the Father, and escapes from justice by flight.

SEA AND STORM.
Don Juan, who bad bribed a party of sailors to convey him ou board, is now in the greatest distress. The ship becomes
.wreck, he is seen struggling with the waves, is cast on shore exhausted, and preserved by the hospitality of some kind
oitagers. Not at all dismayed by the dangers he has just escaped, lie is again guiltv of ihe blackest ingratitude to those
•>y whose bounty he had been snatched from the jaws of death. Scaramouch gain- the shore on the

BACK

OF A

DOLPHIN.

A VILLAGE SCENE and RUSTIC WEDDING. Juan enters, and struck by the beauty of the bndr, tarries her ©IT
">y force——a general alarm.
In ACT IIScaramouch endeavours to reform his Master. Juan undaunted asks the Ghost to a GRAND BANQUET, .here'Juan
in the height of dissipation and boisterous mirth, is struck with the sudden appearance of the MURDERED GUZMAN
vho invites Juan to attend him ; he, with daring boldnesa, acquiesces and attends—THE SEPULCHRE—Flere the Ghost
•shorts huii to repentance, but dead to every sense of fear or punishment, he is at length o'ertakro by artful justice, and
jnecipitated to that abyss provided for the wicked.

A COMIC SONG, BY MR.

n-m

BAILEY.

TO CONCLUDE WITH THE GRAND DRAMATIC SPECTACLE OF" THE

SLEEPING
Or, Enchanted Wood.
T H I S beautiful and interesting spectacle is taken from the story in the Fairy Tales; and so great was its success in
London, that it was performed upwards of two hundred nights successively with most rapturous applause.—The Piece commences with Aldibert and Oswin, two Knight Errants, in quest of adventnrcs, who are benighted in a forest, and determine to
pass the night there. They encounter a groupe of peasants, who request them not to think of stopping iu the wood, it being
enchanted. The oldest of the villagers, Ellen, who is an hundred years of age, informs them there is a castle in the wood
where a lady has lain an hundred years asleep, and her attendants; that a malicious fairy had predicted at hef birth she should
die before she arrived at the age of twenty-one; but that Melzerina, the good Genii tltat presided over the family, in order to
avert the prediction, had laid all in the castle under the dark influence of a MAGIC SLUMBER, that a Knight at the
expiration of the time prescribed, should appear, and to his arm alone belonged the power to break the en.hantinent, and slut
herself was promised the return of youth and beauty. Aldibert, fired at the thought, resolves to encounter tin; perils of the
wood, against the earuest persuasion of his friend and faithful squire, Launcelot.

The good Genii, Melzerina, appears in a brilliant Cloud!
Charms his shield as a talisman against the enchanted wood—he rushes to penetrate the wood, which resists every attempt
'
.
the trees oppose his entrance, and
"

THE ENCHANTED WOOD IS ALL ON FIRE!!
Aldibert presents bis shield, and enchantment falls before him—he enters the Castle, and finds Ethelinda the

SLEEPING BEAUTY,
Surrounded by her attendants, breaks the charm, and restores her to her possessions, which had been usurped by Etheldred
The Piece concludes with the Union of Aldibert and Ethelinda.

MRS. NUNNS most respectfully inform" the Ladies, Gentlemen, and the Public in general, that a Report which is prevalent of Mrs. Jordan having paid part towards "the great expence incurred in bringing the Company from Lichfield to meet
her here, is totally unfounded, and although near Forty Pounds was expended, in consequence of her not futfiling her
Engagement, at the time first appointed, the whole loss fell upon Mis. Nurins, who most earnestly solicits the Public's

of

GEORGE

BARNWELL.
As 'originally acted on the Engligh Stage; retaining that AWFUL and STRIKING SCENE—

THE

EXECUTION
OF

B A R N W E L L AND M I L L W O O D ,
When the Culprits will appear at the fat;d Spot, to which they will be conducted in the usual Form, attended by

e/I Solemn

Procession.

Since the first institution of the Theatres to tbe pfesent day, no t)ramatic Piece has been of more service to society tbati
this admirable Plrty.—The crime* and misfortunes of the unhappy George Barnwell are held upas an awful Monitor to
Youth, and amongst other instances of the great influence of stage effect over the passions, the following anecdote is a
lasting proof of its fascinating power, both to ihiprove the morals and mend the heart. In London, some few years since,
a young gentleman in the mercantile line, had, in an unguarded tnoment, made free with a Considerable sum, the property
of hiseiuployer: chance that evening directed him to Drury-Lane Theatre, where the performance of Mr. Ross, in the
character of'George Barnwell, struck his mind so forcibly, that self-conviction, attended by severe remorse, compelled him
to replace the money so disgfacefully obtained, and by a life of strict honour and probity ever after, he amply atoned for a
temporary deviation from the rules of virtue.
" I've heard that guilty Creatures, sitting at a Play, have, by the very cunning of the scene, been so struck to the
soul, that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions."—^SHAKESPEARE.

LILLO'S TRAGEDY

of

Barnwell.

As originally acted on the ENGLISH STAGE, retaining that AWFUL and STRIKING SCENE—

The Execution of Barnwell & Millwood,
When the Culprits will appear at the fatal Spot, to which they will be conducted in the usual Form, attended by

A SOLEMN PROCESSION.
Since the first institution of the Theatres to the present day, no Dramatic Piece has been of mote service to society than this admirable Play—
The crimes and misfortunes of the unhappy (ieorue Ba-nwell are held up is an awful Monitor to Youth, and amongst other instances of the great
Influence of stage effect over tbe passions, the following anecriote is a lasting ptoof of its fascinating power, both to improve the morals and mend the
heart. In London, some years since, a young gentleman in the mercantile line, had, in an unguarded moment, in ide free with a considerable sum,
the property of his employer: chance that evening directed liilu to Drury-Tiane Thiatre; whore the performance of Mr. Ross, in the character of
George Barnwell, struck his mind so forcibly, that self-co n'ictio i, attended by severe remorse, compelled him to replace the money so disgracefully
obtained, and by a lite of strict honour and probity ever afier, he amply atoned for a temporary deviation from the rules of virtue.
*' I've heard thai guilty creatuits, sitting at a Piny, have, by the very cunning of the scene, been so strutk to the soul, that presently
they hare proclaimed th ir malefactions."—SHAKESPEARE.

The Author of this Tragedy was a Man of a very singular Imagination ; for all his P l a y , are of a Species almost wholly distinct from thorn
of every other dramatic Writer. G E O R G E BARNWKLL, as well as FATAL OURIOSI I'Y, is a Proof of the Particularity of L i n o ' s Muse ; and,
t o be original, both in Design and Kxeention, is surely one of the highest Encomiums that an Artist can deserve. Dialogue, Character, Fable,
Incident—all combine to render this little Three-Act Drama one of the most powerful, at the same Time the rotlst instructive, the Stage has to
boast. W h a t makes this Play peculiarly forcible . ml striking is, that the Event, which here take Place, arc merely the Representation ol Facts
tvhich occurred at a Village on the Western Coast of England.

T H E GRAND DRAMA OF THE

T E M P E S T ; OR, T H E ENCHANTED ISLAND!
To this inimitable effution of exalted genius, beyond all the other unparalled Productions of the Immortal Sfmkspeare, that
profound and learned Critic, Dr. Johnson, is known to have alluded in the following characteristic Lines :—
"
'•
*'
"

When Learning's triumph o'er her barbarous foes,
Fitst reaed the S T A < . E , immortal SHAKSPEAUK rose,
Each change of many-coloured life he drew,
Exhausted worlds, and then iniagin'd new,

•• Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,
- And panting time toil'd after him in vain ;
" His.powerful stroke, presiding truth confesS'il,
" A n d unresisted passion storm'd the breast."

On TUESDAY Evening, APRIL 16, 1816,
Will be pi-eiented SHAKSPEARE'S grand Tragic Romance of THE

Revised, corroded, and adapted te the Stage, by J . P. KEMBLE, with Additions from DavnfeN, DAVENANT, and other

Dr. W a r W t o n ' s Praises of the Tempest are thus supported by Dr. Johnson's following rulogimn: in this Single Drama are exhibited
Princes, Courtiers, and Sailors, all speaking in their real cllarrtcitrS, there i» ttie Ajrency of Airy Spirits, and of an earthly (joblin ; the operations
of Magic, the tumults of a Storm, the adventures of a deserted Island, the nativfe Effusions of untaught affection, the punishment ot guilt, and the

an unaccountable and surprising Power and expansion of Genius, lias presented hi, principal and Mihoidmatc C h a m c u i t , to effectually bet,ire ilie view
ot hi. Auditors, that they appear real Beings, moving and .cling by natural impulse, lioui the n n a and deugns on which the Plot hinges. The
celebrated D r . John,on has observed, that no Historian, however faithful, has given so just a icpresenlation of the Chimiclcis and Events, &c. of
this reign, as Shakspe.re's Historical Tragedy of King Richard the Third, whether we view him ill his Chuiacter of Ulos'ter, before his Accession to
the Throne, his Ambition, the Seas of I,loud and horrid Cruellies committed by him previous, and ihe sacrificing " a l l Ties Divine and H u m a n "
for the accomplishment afterwards, so finely depicted by our immortal Bard, is the truest 1'oilraiiuie that ever was given by any Writer to the World.

THE HISTORICAL TRAGEDY OF

GEORGE BARNWELL;
OR THE LONDON MERCHANT}
As it was originally performed in London, retaining the awful Scene—

THE

EXECUTION

OF MILLWOOD

AND

BARNWELL.

This present THURSDAY, A P R I L 25, 1816,
Will Lie performed the celebrated Tragedy of

GLOR G E

N
W
E
L
L
Or, the London Merchant*
" Be wam'd y e Youths who see ttiy sad despair,
" A v o i d lewd W o m e n ; false as they are f a i r ' 1

Ltiio.
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation, is one of the Plays lately revived in
"..ondoii. The Manager thinks he cannot better discharge his duty to the Inhabitants of Wolverhampton, than by reviving it also in this town.—•
SHAKESPEARE says—

" Those guilty creatures sitting at a Play,
,(
Have by the very cunning of the Scene,
" Beeti SO struck to the soul, that JJrcschtly
" They have proclaim'd their Malefactions."
A Story is recorded, and the Fact can be proved by many living Witnesses, that a young Gentleman of the City of London having embezzled part of his Master's Property, was providentially at the representation of George B.irnwell, at Driiry Lane, when that admirable Actor
M r . Ross, personated IheCliaraeter of George Barnwell, at whose Fate he was so struck to the soul, that it occasioned his immediate contrition
a n d reformation.
The Gentleman so benefitted by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed of acknowledging his obligation to the Play and
Performer, for at every subsequent yearly BeDefit of Mr. Ross, he also received One Hundred Pounds sterling, with a Card to the following
effect:—
" DEAR SIR,—One who is indebted to your admirable Representation of George Barnwell, for more than Life for his redeemed Honour and
*' Credit, begs your acceptance of the inclosed, which you will receive yearly, so long as you continue in the l i n e o f your Profession, flappy am
" I to acknowledge that the Stage has preserved me from Ruin and Disgrace. George Barnwell stopped me in my inSd Career, and saved me
"' from an ignominious Death,
" 1 am your grateful Friend and Servant,
A CONVERT."
Where Instruction can be blended with Amusement, every good patent will be anxious, every Irtdster will be desirous, and every teacher will
tecommend the attendance of their pupils. That the Ira^edv of George Barnwell exposes vice and its never-failing consequences, while it exhorts
and stimulates the youth of both sexes to the practice of virtue, the greatest enemy to the Theatre will not deny ; »uiely then it cannot give
ulfence, if it be earnestly recommended to the heads of Families, and indeed earnestly solicited of them, that they will permit the y o u n i peonlfJ
under theif protection, to be present a t the representation of the moral, instructive, and aftful Tiagcdy of George UaniMell.
11
Learn to he wise from other's harm,
" And you shall do full well."
I.ir r.o.
This Play, it may be depended upon, was lountled on fact j the unfortunate hero of the Tragedy, George Barnwell was executed for the
murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, to which he was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned Woman, in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth! itep by step she led the unwary youth, to the cruel dee 1 which terminated a miierahle existence by the mo.st ignominious death.

As it was originally acted on the English Stage, retainm^r that awful and striking Scene,

Brief Sketch of the Story as related by the Historian St. Foixi
Aubii de Mondedier, travelling, accompanied by a favouri'c Dog, through the Forest of Bondy, was murdered, and buried b j the assassin on
the spot where he fell. The faithful animal who «ilnessed his fate, never quilted (he giave of his unfortunate muster till compi-lltd by hunger, l i e
then proceeded to Paris, and having gained admission to the house of une of Anbn's friend', he, by hi» ciies and extraordinary motions, induced
Borne of the family to follow him to the forest, and lie finally conducted them to the plnee in which the body ol Aubii »a- depo-rted. No clue preieuted itself for the detection of the assassin, till three or four days afterwards, win u the Dog happened to meet the Chevalier Macaire in ihe streets,
and immediately attacked him with the utmust fury. This was to often repeated, that the King at length heard of it, and expressed a strong desire
to see the animal. He found him perfectly tractable until Macuire enrered the room, whom he instantly selected trom a coinpiiuy of twenty persons,
and commenced a furious attack on him. The circumstance coupled with the fact that Macuire had oilen expressed his hailed of Aubri, determine.,
the King to order a combat between the Chevalier and the Dog. The Island of Notie ]).une was ihe place appointed for the fight. Macaire was
armed w ilh » bludgeon, an empty cask was allotted as a place of retreat for the Dog. The combat wes speedi y concluded. The Dog ran round Ins
opponent and avoided his blows; at length watching his opportunity, he tented linn by the tnroat, mid threw him on the earth. Macatie then confessed the murder, and on ihat confession was executed.
In order to give dramatic effect, the author has deviated from the story. I t s places Macairc and Anbri in the smne regiment, and ascribes
Macoire's vengeance to envy and jealousy, arising from the success of Aubri, who, though a young oliicer arrived at Ihe command of a company
before him, and being promised the hund of the daughter of the Colonel, whom Macaire passionately loves, stung (o madnes,, he challenges hit
fortunate rival. Laundry, a brother oflicer and confident of Macaire, advites the party to decide by a throw of dice, whicti is to have the first fire,
Aubri obtains it, but with a noble generosity, fires his pistol in the air.—This noble-minded conduct only inflames the iage of Macaire, and wild the
asaistance of Laundry, he murders Aubri as he passes through the Forest of Bondy. This and a Variety of other interesting Events complete one of
.he best spectacles that has for tome time been brought on the Stage,and ihe eiTect is considerable heightened by reflecting that the circumstances
pourtrayed were absolutely F O U N D E D ON FACT.

ON TUESDAY NEXT, A P R I L 30, 1816,
Will be performed Shakspeare's unrivalled Tragedy of

CBETH,

KING OF SCOTLAND.

7

In this Tragedy are combined some of the greatest beauties of the Immortal Shakspeare ! Huge rocks, the enormous
caverns and blasled heaths of Scotland; the highland warrior's dress, of centuries past; the banquet of the royal court
held at Fores; the awful, yet inspiring music, which accompanies words assimilated to each sound, the fear, the terror
the remorse;—the agonizing throbs and throes, which speak in looks, whispers, sudden starts, and writhing, by Macbeth'
an.l Lady Macbeth, all tending to one great precept, Thou shalt not Murder, render this Play one of the most impressive
moral lessons which the stage exhibits. Jt was the tragedy of Macbeth which conferred upon Shakspeare the distinguished
honour of receiving a letter, written with his Sovereign's own hand, James the First, in testimony of his high admiration
of the work! And Stevens never more highly evinced his judgment, than when he called this Play " the first of all

a neighbouring nobleman, whose wife and child Silver Mask held prisoners, and whose sister he sacrificed to hi. kirless
passion and afterwards murdered. Iago is reported to have entered the bands, and to have effected, by a combination of
artifice'and valour, what the country around had long in vain attempted ; punishment and death to the merciless destroyer
of their domestic peace. The .pirit of the murdered Elvira is said to have appeared in his dying moments—convincing
him that however strong in guilt the villain holds his sway, there is, indisputably, AN AWFUL HOUR OF RETRI£U

Theatre, Wolverhampton.—Oil Monday, Feb. IG, 1818,
WILL BE ACTED SHAKSPEARE'S TRAGEDY OF

HAMLET

If the Drama* of Shakspeare were to be characterised, each by the particular eXeellen0*;
which distinguishes it from the rest, we must alio* to the Tn.xs.i~ of Hainlei the praise ufe
variety. The dialogue throughout it nervous, emphatic, and ttrikitis, , each scene displays th
Hero in a different situation: and whether we behold him as a Lover, the Princo, the Sun, th"
Soldier, or the Man, we find equal room for our utmost admiration. To prove the assertion, we
need only Select, liom the many finely-drawn portraits of dr.tm.itic excellence with which this
piece abound,, the awe-inspiring INTERVIEW with the GHOST of his FATHER, h|, relijimts
observance of every direction given him through the medium of his departed SI UK'S WANDERING SPIRIT, hi, subsequent Interviews with his Mother, in which he produces the AsseuiblancR
of hi. Father and Uncle; his Eulogium on the merits of the former, is a most lever* though just
detestation of the latter ; and the sudden appearance of the Father, who conies to chide him for
hi, delay in bringing hi, murderer to condign punishment, inclines us to pronounce the CLOSET
SCENE A molt perfect dramatic effort. The mournful Distraction of Ophelia fills the. heart
with tenderness; nor is there a person introduced but who produces e.ery effect intended. New
characters appear from time to time In continued succession, exhibiting various forms of life,
and particular modes of conversation ; indeed, the incidents are to numerous, that the argument
of the Play Would make a Urge volume. The scenes are interchangeably diversified with merriment and solemnity} with merriment that includes judicious and instructive observations • and
solemnity not strained by poetical violence above the natural sentiments of man, and when recorded testimony avows it al the favourite production of our Immortal Hard, we presume it
cannot have a greater claim upon the Public for every support and attention. •

K I N G H E N R Y II.
OR,

THE

Fall of Fair Rosamond, in Woodstock Boiver.
The Subject of the above P l a y i s o n a o f the most interesting we have in the History of
England. King Henry the Second, after the fatigue of the chace, accompanied by the Earl of
Huntingdon and baron Clifford, is Invited by the latter into hi. Casile in the Forest, to take
»on»e refreshment. The King there sees Rosamond, (the daughter of Lord Clifford, of Clifford
Castle, in the county of Hertford,) and is enathoured by her beauty.
After , his departure, he
quits his train, and subdued by the unconquerable passion of love, returns to the Baron's Castle,
ascends the garden wall, finds Rosamond, noos, wins, and persuades her to elope with him.
Clifford, missing his daughter, pursues her, but not recovering her, throws himself into Godstow
Priory, and determines to become a Monk. At this period our Author commences his Play,
The Queen, by her secret emissaries ai Court, finds she has a rival in the affections of the King,
and is fired with rage and jealousy at the discovery. His Majesty, well knowing the disposition
of Queen Eleanor, and dreading the consequences, shOqld she know of Rosamond's concealment,
has a Bower so Artfully constructed at Woodstock, that no human power can discover i t ; but.
Slung with remorse at seducing the daughter of his friend, reveals it to Clifford, the supposed
Monk, informing him likewise, that only by a Silver Clue he can discover

THE

BOWER OF FAIR ROSAMOND.

Clifford reveals it to the Abbot of Godstow, who, conceiving an inveterate hatred to Henry, a,:d
well knowing the disposition of the Queen, informs her of the mode of access to the liower. In
the mean time the Abbot sends Clifford, the supposed Monk, to persuade Rosamond to take the
veil and quit her retirement, which to induce her to do, he discovers himself to be her father. The
Queen, now informed of the Clue to Fair Rosamond, brings a Bowl of Poison, compelling the
unhappy Rosamond to drink, to avoid being stabbed. The King returns to the Bower just time
enough to receive the p i t t i n g breath of his beloved Rosamond, wbo expires lamented by all, the
vindictive Queen herself not excepted.
Here let the gdy seducer turn bis eye*,
And see the dread effects of lawless love!
Lean, 'tis no single crime—the mischief spreads
To all the dearest lies of social life! —

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY.25, 1818.
T U B THEATRE.—The gentleman who made h i . appearance at Charles Surface, in the School for Scandal, on
Friday night, fully justified, by h i . performance, our r e port of his talents. Every attention was paid him b y
the audience ; and, to the great credit of the Gallery, we
never witnessed more order in this or a n y other Theatre.
The boxes were crowded early, and the two first circle,
almost exclusively occupied by fashionably dressed l a dies.
The character of Charles was admirably welt
chosen by our debutante.
Upon his appearance at the
social board, he was greeted with loud and reiterated
plaudits, and the opportunity the tcene afforded of
bracing the nerve with a glass of good wine, (which the
Manager had provided) and the song of " H e r e ' s to the
M a i d e n , " & c gave him time for recovering a degree of
»elf-possession.
Every person under similar circumstances, who is at all susceptible of feeling, must be
somewhat embarrassed j and in the present instance t h a t
embarrassment was heightened by facing the burnt of
criticism in the midst uf relatives and acquaintances.—
In proportion, however, as difficulties present themselves,
does an enterprising spirit feel the desire and gratification of surmounting t h e m ; end hence the complet*
triumph of the hero of the night. In every speech—in
every line—he gained confidence, anil as he advanced in
the character, gave it with all the 8<m - «te and ease of an
experienced artist,
His emphasis was judicious, and
his affection for the portrait of bis uncle was expressed
with a warmth of feeling which fully justified old Noll's
forgiveness of bis thoughtless extravagance. The Screen
scene was admirable, and most ably supported by the
dry, chaste, and natural humour of tbe Manager in Sir
Peter. The efl'ect occasionally produced by his arch
look and quaint delivery, can only be appreciated b y
those who witnessed his (we pronounce) finished representation of the dignified, warm-hearted, and pettish old
Baronet. The Joseph of Mr, C Crisp, tbe Lady Teazle
of Mrs. Hall, the Crabtree of Watkinson, and tbe Moses
of Shuter, were also amongst the conspicuous features of
a play which was admirably acted throughout,—a p l a y
which secured for its unrivalled author tbe highest pinnacle of dramatic fame!—Foote's excellent farce of the
Liar finished the Entertainmeut of the evening, and the
arduous character ol Young Wilding was performed b y
M r . C Crisp with a spirit and discrimination which
would, if it were possible, have raised him in our estimat i o n : he was well supported by Shuter in Papillion. O u r
Manager"takes Ins benefit this evening, and will appearin two opposite and favourite characters. W e sincerely
wish him that success be appears anxious to deserve;
and, indeed, we do not entertain a doubt but the House
will overflow in every p a r t , — s e e advt.

Mr.

Rowbottom.

ON TUESDAY, MARCH 10, 1818,
Will be performed SHAKSPEARE'S Tragedy of

OTHELLO,
MOOR OF

VENICE.

This is one of Shiikspeart's Dramas, in which all Critiscism has been abandoned to the Tribute of Praise. So vast it the power of the Author's skill in delineating the rise and progress of sensations in the human breast, that a young and
elegant Female is hereby represented by his magic pen as deeply in love with a
Moor, a man different in complexion and features from her and her whole race,
and yet without the slightest imputation of delicacy resting upon her toate; whilst
the Moor doats upon her with all the transports of the impassioned lover. The
consummate art and malignant spirit of lagn, are so reverse from the generous candid Othello, that it appear, the very zenith of the Poet's genius to have conceived
two Personages in the same Drama ; but to have brought them on the Stage together in almost every Scene, .is the very Acme of human Intellect.

To the correct performance of his various duties as a Manager, the strictest attention will
be paid in matters relating to the STACE, as well as the general accommodation
of his visitors,
t o whom he bogs, with due deference, t o state, that the claims of the public in an adjoining p a r t
of the circuit making it indispensable for him to employ two distinct Companies during the
present winter, may render his occasional! absence from Wolverhampton unavoidable, I t will,
however, he trusts, be considered by Ins friends as t h e strongest testimony of his desire to merit
the favours he feels assured this candid statement W'll not abate, when, on SUCH occasions, t h e
guidance of the Wolverhampton Theatre will be placed under the direction of his Brother, Mr.
CHARLES C R I S P , whose exertion heretofore has been most generally approved, and will equally
with his own, as Actor and Manager, be exerted to merit their approving sanction and support.

etjCittttt. ERdnoo^ntttDton.
ON FRIDAY EVENING, JANUARY J, 1819,
Will be acted the Historical Tragedy of

George

Jlarnwell.

As it was originally acted on the English Stage, retaining that awful and ttriking Scene,

The Execution of Barnwell and Millwood,
W h e n the Culprits will appear at the fatal Spot, to which they will be conducted in the usual
Form, and attended by

A SOLEMN PROCESSION.
" Be warn'd ye Youths who . e e my sad despair,
" Avoid lewd Women ) false as they are fair."
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising
generation, is on&of the Plays lately revived in London. The Manager thinks he cannot better
discharge his duty In the inhabitants of Wolverhampton, than by reviving it also in this town.—
SuAKSI'KAItK says —
" T h o s e guilty creatures sitting at a P l a y ,
*' Have by the very cunning of the Scene
" Been so struck to the soul, that presently
" They have proclaim'd their Malefactions."
This P l a y , it may be depended upon, was founded on f a c t , the unfortunate hero of the Trag e d y , Geotge Barnwell, was executed for the minder of his virtuoi.s and venerable Uncle, to
which he was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned Woman, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; step by step she led the unwary youth to the cruel deed which terminated a miserable
existence by the most ignominious death.

OF AN UNFORTUNATE MAID ;
OR,

The Fatal Hour of Four!
The Action of which is laid in Franco; but it is founded on a recent Event; compiled,
•elected, and arranged for Representation, from a Work lately published at Warwick.
In this Ballet of Action, every Sentiment which can awake the Feelings to a true Sense of
Remorse, for a Crime at which human Nature shudder, but to think, has been sedulously selected,
as well as carefully to avoid any Detail that would he objectionable to the most delicate Mind,
from the strong and just Conviction, that the great End of the Drama is best answered when Vice
is punished, Virtue rewarded, and the sacred Cause of MORALITY SUPPORTED,

Our Theatre has lately held forth considerable attraction, and it has been liberally met on the part of the
public.
Miss S. Booth drew full house, during her
engagement, and on Friday the theatre overflowed in
every part for her benefit.—The patronage of the Society
of True Britons on Monday, produced, a, we anticipated, a bumper. The performances went off with great
eclat, and the national airs of " God save the K i n g "
and " R o l e B r i t a n n i a " were sun,; during the evening,
and most warmly applauded.
On this occasion our
spirited and liberal townsman, Mr. Evans, who is a
staunch supporter of the D r a m a , and belongs to the
Britons' Club, gave an elegant and sumptuous dinner to
the members and many others of his friends. The glass
circulated freely until seven o'clock, when the p a r t y ,
amounting to upwards of fifty, highly gratified by the
hospitality and attention with which tbey had been entertained, retired in a body to the theatr..—Another
novelty was produced last night, in the celebiated M r .
Sinclair, from Covent-Garden, who gave some of h i ,
most popular songs, which afforded a high treat.—The
Manager takes his annual benefit tbi, evening, when
there can be little doubt be will be greeted with his usual
success.—see advt.
The benefit of Mr. and Mrs. Shuter is fixed for Monday, and is under the Patronage of thr Benevolent
Society. He is an old and deserved favourite; indeed
tbey are both highly respectable in their line; and we
sincerely wish them that support to which they have a
fair claim,—Mr. Vining t a k e , his benefit on T u e s d a y :
be is an improving actor, and during the present season
bas been much before the public, whose gooi will it has
been his evident study to conciliate by a correct attention to his professional duty.—see ailvts.

SoMF.nvr r.Lp, who has acquired such great fame by her
competition will] Miss O ' N E I L L , at Covent Garden, h a ,
excited considerable interest iitnoni; the lovers of the
D r a m a in this town.
Tins Lady's representation of
Bianca, in the tragedy of Fazio, is perhaps the greatest
performance ever witnessed on this stage, and as near
perfection as the art can attain ; she was ably supported
b y Mr. C. Citlsf, whose performance of Faiio waa chaste
and effective. Miss SOHKRVII.LE'S highest calling appears
to lie in the terrible working up of passion, and also in
the most intense feeling, in every part which called fsrth
these quallications, thev were embodied in their most
strong and beautiful colouring,
Her benefit and last
appearance takes place on Friday, to which, and her
performance of this evening, we have not the slightest
doubt the attention of the public will be ardently evinced.
