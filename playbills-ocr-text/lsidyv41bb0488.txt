intended to cow*jr, through the medium of Stage -'fleet, the POTRAITURE of L1FK, delineating in
T W E N T Y - T W O SCENES, a variety of incidents, accidents, occurrences, and acquaintances, liable
or likely to wtrude themselves upon the notice of a STRANGKR IN L'»NDON. The whole intended
to pourtray, or rather to animate some of the most interesting ctiapters in PXEHCE KOAO'» highly
popular work, after which this Piece is called, viz.

PaoniMiuH—If as Shakespeare asserts, the proper End of the Oram, is—" To hold as 'twere the mirror up to
Nature, to .hew Virtue her own feature. Vice her own image, and the very age and body of the Time its form and
pressure."—the Aathor claims for this Piece a place in the very highest claw of the Drama.—An animated picture of
.very species of Life in London, deprived, through thefilteringstone of the Proprietor's critical care, of .11 that might
disgust or offend even the most fastidious imagination ; that experience of the Economy of Life, and that knowledge of
many of Us stumbling blocks, which have hitherto only been purchased at the expense of many pounds, much time,
and frequently no small .hare of peace and health, may here, in a few hours, for merely a Playhouse Admission, be
effectually and pleasantly acquired and secured. As in a mirror. Life is, in this Piece, shewn in all its varieties—
Virtue He* its own feature. Vic* its own image, and the age and body of the Time is furnished by Author, Artist, and
Dress-maker, with it* form and pressure.

PROGRAMME OF THE BUSINESS OF THE PIECE.
Act I.—The Dog conveys a Signal from his Master on shore to the Ship.—The faithful Dog dashes the Cup
of Poison from the Treacherous Indian's hand at the very moment his Master is on the point of drinking it; he
then prevents the malignant and disappointed Indian from slabbing his Master. Faithful Carlo endeavours to break
open the Chest m which the ferocious Chief is concealed; thus he preserves his Master from destruction, and then
pnra.es the Savages, in order to rescue the lost Wife and Child of his distracted Master.
Act II. —The Dog in pursuit, crosses a Bridge, carries a Lighted Torch to the Lady, who burns asunder the
Cord by which she is bound, and thus faithful Carlo procures his Mistress's release.

A GRAND

COMBAT

Between Carlo and the Ferorimis Chief to save the Infant from destruction, in which Carlo proves rictoriou*: the
Dog likewise preserves the Child from an KHOBMOUS SERPENT,
and is safely conveyed to his Parents by
the ever faithful Carlo.—He fetches the Boat's Crew, who engage in a general Combat with the Snvnges, ra which
the Sailors are completely triumphant, and the Treacherous Indian Chief falls under the fangs of the incomparable
and mefon'ou., Carlo.

On account of the great Expense of this Performance, NO HALF-PRICE can be taken.

Nature, to shew Virtue her own feature. Vice her own image, and the very age and body of the Time its form and

Of all the subjects which hive been dramatised from Scottish Legends, none equals that from
which the " Warlock of the Glen" is borrowed. The suffering Countess of Glcucairu, with her
Infant Son, seek shelter from the villany of Clanronald in the Hut of the honest Fisberraau Andrew
obliged to fly from thence, they are surprised by the MYSTERIOUS APPEARANCE of the
lARLOCK! who pledges himself to protect her Child, and as Clanrontld and his Agents are
i a t to tear them asunder, he interposes, and accuses her Oppressor as THE MURDERER OF
LENCAIRN!—Cal'ous to the cries of conscience, the, tear her from her Child, and driveu by
*ir and agony for its loss, she, to escape Clanronald, THROWS HERSELF FROM A ROCK
TO THE SEA ! She is rescued by Andrew, wlio leaves her to go in search of Adelbert.
rected by the warnings of the Warlock, he preserves them from (lie DAGGER OF THE
ASSASSINS! and at the moment when the schemes-of Clanronald seem on the point of completion,
they .re defeated, and villainy is overthrow n'

Therese,
ThC ORPHAN

of

GENEVA.

It is enough perhaps to announce to the Public, in favor of this must interesting Drama, that
the Critics have pronounced it the most perfect Piece of the present style of Dramatic t n t e , which is
sufliuent'y proved by ils unequalled success at the Theatre-Royal Drury-Lane, where it has . b e a d ,
been repeated upwards of 20 Nights, and still continues to be performed with increasing intere«t and
popularity. The feelings of a British Audience must always be powerfully excited by the action of
this Drama, which exhibits a persecuted and helpless Orphan, (Therese) extricated from the powerful
toils of villany. by the virtuous instraments of Providence, with the punishment of such daring and
triumphant guilt as is manifested by Carwin. a wicked Advocate, perverting those laws society expects
him to guard, and oppressing the weak which it is his duty to defend, who in the wild deliri.ni of
his guiltj career, murders an unoffending Lady, mistaking her for the Orphan, whose destruction he
is most resolute to accomplish. At the moment of the murder, a THUNDERBOLT destroy, part
of the Pavilion, which is immediately seen in Sanies, where the crime is perprelmted, and for a
>le the innocent is permitted to suffer for the guilty, till at length Justice, though slow, overtake,
wretch, who overwhelmed and conscience struck, resigns himself tu the fate lie had prepare.! Ibr

This celebrated Tragedy proved wonderfully attractive during the two last Seasons, at the Theatre-Roy.t
Covent Oarden: no Play since Pizarro having had so great a run. It is taken from an early point of Roman
History, while contending with the Neighbouring States, and the Tyranny of In, Decemvirate. The Author ha,
very judiciously pourtrayed the Manners and Customs of the Homans at tliat early period, which combined with
the well-known story of Virginius devoting his Daughter to preserve her from the Tyrant Appins Oladius, give.
ample scope to delineate the passions, and renders it, with other incidents, one of the roost interesting and attractive.
Tragedies the Stage can boast of.

To conclude with, for the first Time in this Theatre, a New Dramatic Romance, in three Acts, (with entirely
Ner- Scenery, painted by Mr. STANTON. .Jun.) entitled T H E

Or, BRIDE

OF THE

ISLES.

Thts celebrated and extraordinary Drama is f. unded on the well-known Tale of Lord Byron, embodying one of
th. most wild and frightful Superstitions of the darker Ages rl he Vampires are supposed to he Evil Spirits permitted to roam about the Earth in a mortal Shape, with supernatural powers of fascination, so long as they sacrifice
yearly, before the setting of the last Moon in every year, a young female, whom they most previously marry, and
whose blood is necessary to support their exislance. The < oon is supposed to posses, strange influence over these
terrific creatures; if slain by a mortal hand, and their Corpses are so placed as to catch the first beams of the Moon
when it rises, they Income re-animated, and ajain appear in the.r human characler. Their fatal charter, however, is
utterly lost if through any delay the appointed Moon sinks into the Ocean, before the Vampire has sacrificed his victim—Thi» Piece was originally produced in Paris, where its effect upon the Audience was ELFCTRICU ! It has
since been transferred to the London Stage with a success equally decided and triumphant; and is now brought
forward in STAFFORD, with every Scenic Embellishment Attention could furnish or Ejtpence command.

This Tragedy is founded on one of the most striking events in Roman History. The father and the elder Brother of Lueiu.
Junius were murdered and their wealth seized upon by Tarquin, King of Rome. Lucius Junius, to save himself from
the same fate, feigns to be an Idiot; he is therefore suffered to lt»e as the fool of the Court, and becomes the sport and derision of the King, his Sons, and the whole People. The melancholy death of his Kiuswoman Lucretia, occasioned by
the brutal violence of Sextus Tarquin. the King's eldest Son. induces him to throw of the mask he so long had woru, and
aided by the Sybil Prophecy, 4i A FOOL SHOULD SET ROME FRKF.," rouses the People lo break their
chains of Slavery, and expel theTarquins; which laid the foundation of Roman Greatness, and eventually mad. tfie»

Deprived of the means of asserting his birthright, and. to a certain degree cast on the world a cosmopolite, he became a Minister
or the Presbyterian persuasion, and now officiates in the Z.oti Church, New York The subject of this memoir born *4th July
I SOT was destined for the same profession, but prefered the Sock aud Buskin, he departed from his Fathers roof and wend his

On TUESDAY Evening, FEBRUARY 15th, 1831,
Will be performed, (not acted here for many years) Shakspeare's celebrated Historical Play, called

CYWRELINE
King of Britain ; Or, The Injured

Princess.

This Play is founded on a Period of Time noon after the Romans became Masters of Britain. Shakspeare has followed the
History in those early ages pretty close. There is through the whole Play a deal of Bustle, Plot, and Incident, similar to the time
from whence it is taken. The noble defence made by POSTHUMUS, BELLARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIOARUS, in a grand
ftght between the Romans and Britons, who, by their single Valour, turned the Fortune of Battle and put the Romans to night,
convincing us that our Ancestors were possessed of Courage; (if not Discipline) equal to those Masters of the World, as they
were then styled. Cymbeline's discovery of his lost Sons, who had been stolen from him, and bred up under the Tuition of
old BEIAAHIUS, giving a pleasing turn to the Piece; and POSTHUMVS finding IMOGEN living and innocent, not only winds
up the Plot agreeably to the Rules of Criticism, but, must both affect, and please, a judicious Audience.

The Moral and Instructive I^esson which this Drama conveys to all ranks of Society, combined with the novel and pleasing
manner in which it is delineated, has rendered it the most popular and attractive that has been brought out for many year?. So
great has been its run in Paris, where it was first performed, that every Manager of thenumerous London Theatres, sent over
persons to see, and translate it into English; and the wonderful success it has met with, has fully rewarded the great expence of
its production.

On SATURDAY Evening, FEBRUARY 19th, 1831,
Will be presented, the moral and instructive Tragedy, called

George Barnwell;
Or, THE

LONDON

APPRENTICE,

This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation, was founded on fact. Tlie
unfortunate hero of the piece was executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
to which he was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned Woman, who step by step led the unwary youth to the last cruel
deed, which terminated a miserable existance, by the most ignominious death.
A story is recorded, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, ttiat a young gentleman of the City of London,
having embezzled part of his Master's property, was providentially at the representation ot George Barnwell,at Drury-Jane. when
that admirable actor, Mr. Rons, personated the character of George Barn wen, at whoBefate he was so struck, that, it occasioned
his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman so benefited by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to own his
obligation to the Play and the Performer, for at every subsequent yearly Benefit Mr. Ross, received a Hundred Pounds Sterling,
with a card to the following effect.
** Dear Sir!—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, for more than life, for his redeemed
honour and credit—begs your acceptance of the inclosed , which sum yon will receive yearly, as long as you continue in your
profession—Happy am I to acknowledge, that the Stage has prevented me from ruin and disgrace. George Barnwell has stopped
me in my mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death."
*
A celebrated and learned Divine observes that Fathers and heads of Families, whose duty is to watch over and guide the morals
of the rising generation, would do well to permit young people under their direction, to be present at the performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which Instruction is blended with Amusement.

b» placed in front of the Dramatic line : it is one of those regular Dramatic Amusements of our Country, that throws the flimsey spin men I
productions of the present day far in the rear; and is calculated to open the heart of an Englishman to every thing that is high,
noble, and generous—to shew also tha beauty of Virtue and the hideouviMS of Vice—to make him firmly attached to Libert
Loyalty—to fill his mind with affection for his family, love fur his Country, and obedience to bis King.

On MONDAY l i v e n i n g , 2nd FEBRUARY, 1 8 3 5 ,
Will be presented, the moral and instructive Tragedy of

George Barnwell;
Or, The LONDON MERCHANT.
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which lins been so beneficial to the rising generation, was founded
on facts. The unfortunate hero of the niece was executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to which he was instigated bj an artful, cruel and abandoned Woman, who step by
step led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated, miserable existence, by the most ignominiousdeath.
A. story is recorded and the fact can be proved by many li.Hig witnesses that a young gentleman ot the City of
London having embezzled part of his Master's properly, ftas providentially at the representation George Barnwell,
at Drury Lane, when that admirable actor Mr. Ross, personated the Character ot George Barnwell, at whose fate
he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman so benefited ny this
excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to own his obligation to Hie Play and Performer , for at every subsequent
yearly benefit, Mr Boss received a Hundred Pounds Sterling, wiih a card to the following efl'ecl. "Dear Sir;—One
who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, for more than life, tor his redeemed honor
and credit—begs your acceptance of the enclosed i whicn sum you. shall receive yearly, as long as yon continue in
j our profession—Happy am I to acknowledge that the Stage has prevented me from ruin and disgrace, George Barnwell has stopped me in my mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death."
A celebrated and learned divine observes, that Fathers and heads of Families, whose duty is to watch and guide
the morals of the rising generation, would do well to permit .young people under their direction, to be present at the
performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which Instruction is bleuded wilh Amusement.

'

Written b j Dr. MOOHR. In the progress of this admirable play, the finest feelings of the hum-in breast are alternately roused to the highest pitch of tenderness, and the very acme of distress I The language is energetic and sublime !
The circumstances described, are those of an amiable family plungedinin the most agonizing affliction, by the destructive
practice of Qaming. T o curb this vice, and guard against its evils, becomes the duly of the Moralist and Public
Lecturer, though uone can so effectually picture its enormities as those " Who hold the mirror up to nature, who shew
vice its own image, and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure."
Hence may the Gamester learn, ere yet too lale
T o shun that Vice which endless ills await i
Wild as the Sea his maddening Passions
flow,
Himself, Wife, Children, heggar'd at a throw.

Oil! shooldja Falher or a Husband come.
Whom Dice have lured from happiness and home,
T o listen t o our tale,—our hope is here.
T o cheek one Gamester in his mad career.

On MONDAY EVENING, «8rd MARCH, 1835,
Will be performed, the excellent and moral TRAGEDY, of THE

GAMESTER
Or,

The FALSE

FRIEND

Written bv Dr. MOORE. In the progress of this admirable play, the finest feelings of the human breast are alternately round to the highest pitch ot tenderness and the very acme of distress ! The language is enereetic and sublime!
The circumstances described, are those of an amiable family plunged; into the most agonizing affliction,, by the destructive practice of Gaming. T o curb this vice and guard against Us evils, becomes the duly of the Moralist and
Public Lecturer, though none cun so effectually picture its enormities as those " W h o hold the Mirror up to nature,
who shew vice its own image, and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure."
Oh ! should a Father or a Husband come,
Hence may the Gamester learn, ere yet too late
Whom Dice have lured from happiness and home.
T o shun that Vice which endless ills await;
T o listen to our tale.—our hope is here.
Wild as the Sea his maddening Passions Bow,
To check one Gamester in his mad career.
Himself, Wife, Children, beggar'd at a throw.
