In the First Ages, Vocal Music had the entire supren acy over In.ti umental, particularly from the introduction of Christianity to the end of the Sixteenth Century. Thus many ot the early Compositions were deprived of those Orchestral Accompaniments with which the Modern Ear has been so long familiarised; but to give a perfect idea of primitive Music, the Instrumental Performers will only appear in the order wherein
their respective Instruments were first introduced into an Orchestra.

DRVRY LANE.
, Master Burke, whose perfoimances some few years ago at the Surrey aie fresh in the memory of the play-going public, has recently appeared at this theatre, aftei a very successful careei < in the United States Although we did not anticipate that ' “ time had thinned his flowing locks,’’ or stolen from the boy the gaiety and archness of youth, we scarcely expected to find that it had deprived him so slightly of those qualities of 4 natural humour, vivacity, and instinctive appreciation of art,
| wBfch he developed at so eaily an age, and which constituted in the child a miracle of power The change that has taken place in his personal appearance has the effect rather of heightening than diminishing the interest of his acting He has outgrown mere boyhood, and is fast springing into a ripe youth, but his figure is slight and extremely jjivemle, and he still retains that piemature air which links l$m to the period when he first trod a stage that was then as marvellous and as pleasurable to himself as he rendered it to his audiences. His voice has acquited a fuller and firmer body of tone, and his manner is more settled and matured The mere joyousness of the boy has given way to a consciousness of his part, and he acts more from his judgment than his animal spirits The exuberance of his early performance is evidently repressed in a clear perception of the demands of character, and he already asserts his place amongst actors who ‘ tried less by the standard of youth than the test of relative ence His Doctor O'Toole is not so rich in mere whim extravagant caricature as it is rendered by Power, but it is nearer to life and likelihood, and claims a closer kindred to the na lveTrogue If we do not miscalculate upon his future progress, he will develope abilities that have rarely continued through the after-life of precocious talent The early bloom,
’	reverb, is the hist to fade, but we are mistaken if
-jrke ’’ do not prove that there is but little replaced on the wisdom of proverbs.
Zaafpa of If erold—upon which we wrote at some length whin it was performed in London by the German company—has been produced n an English dress at this house, under the title of The Corsair, and continues to be * played with success An accidental circumstance obliges us to postpone our notice of it, but we hope to find a place for rt ; nett yreek.	«at!

A Mrs. Shaiipe, from the United States, made her first appearance last ni|ht in the character of Lady Macbeth. She rather exceeded our expectations, from what we had heard of the line of parts she was accustomed to fill in New York ; and from the indisputable fxctf that while America has gone near to spoil some of our tragic performers, she has given ua few or none of her own that have bean good for anything in return. Mrs. Sharps, is a Indy of good person and conn' tenacee, but she lias attempted too much ; and in the endeavour to do all she could, she was guilty of that vice which is usually designaied fiy the word mouthing. Her emphasis was never very mistaken, and generally indicative of good sense and a char understanding ; but it was often too much and too elaborate, so as to make her recitation almost fatiguing. She read the letter discreetly, but in the usual way, excepting towards the conclusion, where she strove to make a new and forcible point, and thereby overdid the thing. Her manner of describing what she would have done to her own child, rather than abandon a purpose to which she was bo deeply sworn, made the picture rather offensive from itscoarsenes*. The scene with Macbaih, in which she takes the dagger», was the best portion of her performance, and the banquet was not ill executed, hut we have several ladies still on the stage who would have done it a* well, and one or two who would have dona it better, Mr». Sharpe'*‘greatest deficiency was where Lady Macbeth walks in her sleep: it was over-acted both m word and isotion, and was deficient in that delicacy and quietness that h^e absolutely requisite. She was much applauded, and ungainly haamany claims to encouragement.
MacREADv returned to Macbeth and was v* . **cart')jr greeted, especially on his entrance, after so long an a^rfnee. He r ’iyed the part in his usual iajmnor with the most just eoBCWptioa of tbe-cha*act r, but here ami th»» frail ryilrar in it* execution. Coobkk was Macduff; but nil the‘rest of the cast was lamentably inferior to the just demands of the xuthor. Ybe audience was far from numerous.
