On WEDNESDAY Evening, May 24th, T820,
Will be brought forward, (never acted here) the HISTORICAL TRAGEDY oj,
BRUTUS:
Or,	The Fall of Tarquin.
THIS Tragedy is founded on one of the most striking events in Homan History. The Father and the elder Brother of Lnciua Junius were murdered and their wealth seized on by Tarquin, King of Home. Lucias Jam ms to save himself from the same fate, feigns tu be an Idiot; he is therefore suffered to live as the Fool of the Court, and becomes the sport and derision of the King, his Sons, aiid the whole People. The melancholy death of his kinswoman Lucretia, occasioned by the brntai violence of Swrxtus TarqniiL the King’s eldest Son, induces him to throw off the mask he so long had worn, and aided hy the Sybil Prophecy, "A FOOL SHOULD CET ROME FREE*** rouses the People to break their chains of Slavery, and expel the Tarquins ; which laid the foundation af Roman greatness, and eventu* ally made them MASTERS OF 1HE WORLD.
The number of Nights this Tragedy has already been acted since its first representation, decidedly proves its atxL ushit —Indeed such are its attractive powers, that Drury-Lane Theatre every time it is performed, is crowded by a delighted and applauding AMdjcace*

OTHELLO
MOOR OF VENICE.
Hazlitt, one of the first Dramatic Critics of the day, makes the following Remarks on this admired Play, which may justly entitle it to the name of the First Tragic Composition in this or any other Country.
“ Of this most excellent Play, it may justly be said, if perfection exist in any human production it is to be found here, it requires less peculiar comment than any of Shakespeare’s Plays ; it is indeed beautiful; though highly poetical, its excellence does not consist in its poetry; it is pure passion; its beauty is almost lost in its reality and grandeur; in fact it is grand beyond loveliness, and of such exquisite beauty as to make us in love with sorrow.

On MONDAY EVENING, June lOtli, 1822,
Will be performed tbe New and Popular Play, (never acted here.) called
Y*irginius;
Or, the Downfall of the Decemvirate.
This celebrated Play proved wonderfully attractive during the last Season, at the Theatre-Royal, 0>vent Garden, no Play since Pizarro having had so great a run. It is taken iron« an early point of Roman History, while contending with the neighbouring States, and the Tyrany of the Decemvirate.
The Author has very judiciously portrayed the Manners and Customs of the Romans at that early period ; which combined with the well-known story of Virginius devoting his Daughter, to preserve her from the Tyrant Appius Claudius, gives ample scope to deliniate the passions, and renders it with other incidents one of the most interesting and attractive Plays the Stage can boast of.

Will be presented, LILLO'S TRAGEDY, (not acted here Jor several years) called,
George Barnwell;
Or, The London Apprentice.
THIS affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation, was founded on fact, The unfortunate he o of the piece was executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle in the 'etgn oi Queen Elizabeth, to which be was in-ligat ed bv an artf ul, ctael and abandoned Woman, «ho step by step led the unwary youth tu the [a-t cruel deed which terminated a miserable existence, by the most ignotuini ms death
A stow is recorded, and the fact can be p'oved by many living witnesses, that a young gentleman of the City of London having embezzled ,wrtol his Waiter’s property, was providentially atthi representation of George Barnwell, at Grury-lane, when that aonnrable actor, Mr. KUS:s, personated the character of Gvo-ge Barnwell, ai whose late he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. T he geutleinan so benefited by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to own his obligation to the Play and the Perfumer ; tor, at every subsequen, yearly Benefit, Mr. ROSS received a Hundred Pounds Sterling with a Card to the following effect.
“DnxSi !—1f’ne who is indebted to y >ur adinitable representation of George Barnwell for more than lif —for his redeemed ho-Hour and credit begs your acceptance ol the inclosed ; which sum you will receive yearly, so long as you con'inue in your profession— Happy am 1 to cknmtledge, that the stage has prevented me fiom rum and disgrace, George Barnwell has stopped me in my mad
career, and saved me fr'm an ignominious death ”
A celebrated and learned Divine obse-ves that Fathers and Heads of Families, whose duty it is to watch over and guid» the morals of the rising Generation, would do well to permit young penplc under tb-ir direction, to be present at the performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which Instruction is blended with Amusement.

THEATRE, DRAYTON.
On THURSDAY EVENING, AUGUST the 4th, 1825,
Will he Performed, a Veto Dramatic Romance, in three Acts, {with entirely New Scenery, painted by Air. STANTON,
Jun.) entitled,
The V ampire ;
OR, BRIDE OF THE ISLES.
This celebrated and extraordinary Drama is founded on the well-known Tale of Lord Byron, embodying one of the most wild and frightful Superstitions of the darker ages. The Vampires are supposed to be Evil Spirits permitted to roam about the Earth in a mortal Shape, with supernatural powers of fascination, so long as they sacrifice yearly, before the setting of the last Moon in every year, a young female, whom they most previously marry, and whose blood is necessary to support their existence. The Moon is supposed to possess strange influence over tlic-e terrific creatures; if slain by a mortal hand, and their corpse are so placed as to catch the iir-t beams of the Moon when it rises, they become re-animated, and again appear in their human character. Their fatal charter,
however, is utterly lost if through any delay the appointed Moon sinks into the Ocean before the Vampire has sacrificed his victim._
This Piece was originally produced in Paris, where its effect upon the Audience was electrical! It has since been transferred to the London Stage with a success equally decided and triumphant -, and it is now brought torward in Drayton, with every Scenic Embellishment Attention could furnish or Expeuce command.

Will be performed, the justly celebrated Tragedy, of
BRUTUS;
DIB» TTIRIB PAM» DP 'ifAIBii’JOM«
THIS Tragedy i» founded on one of the most striking events in Roman History. The Father and the elder Brother of Lucins Junius »ere murdered and their wealth seized on by Tarquin, King of Rome. Lucius Junius, to save himself from the same fate, feigns to be an Idiot; he is therefore suffered to live as the fool of the Court, and becomes the sport and derision of the King, his Sons, and the whole People. The melancholy death of his kinswoman Lucretia, occasioned by the brutal violence of Sextus Tarquin, the King's eldest Son, induces him to threw off the mask he so long had worn, and aided by the Sybil Prophecy, «A POOL SHOULD SET ROME FREE, ” rouses the People to break their chains of Slavery, and expel the Tarquius; which laid the foundation of Roman greatness, and eventually made them MASTERS OF THE WORLD.

To the Ladies and Gentlemen of Drayton and the Neighbourhood, Mr. FAWCETT takes this opportunity to make his gratefnl acknowledgments for the Support he has been honor’d with for many years, and earnestly solicits a continuation of the same kindness upon the present occasion, when THREE CELEBRATED NEW PIECES, (two of them never acted in this Theatre before) will be performed.	_
On Wednesday Evening, August 28th, 1833,
An entirely new Drama, performed at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, called
The Robber’s Wife;
<823* WX'13	mWPQ <9JUT®*
This romantic Drama is a tale of crime, sorrow and remorse-, the hero and heroine, the once gay Mark Rediand, (Murdock the Robber;) Rose Briarly, erst the pride of the village, the Robber's Wife. Alas! bow .-hanged their appearance and condition, their complexion stained, their hair dyed : the miserable tenants of a wretched hovel, bearing the semblance of an Inn, to lure the unwary traveller to plunder and outrage. The first crime of Rose, was disobedience; her father to retrieve a ruined fortune, had journeyed to a far country, leaving his daughter in the care of an old friend—In defiance of duty, she married his bitterest foe; the man who had
robbed him, and who (though she knew it not) was an outlaw, and a felon—and Rose becomes the passive agent of her husband's crimes, the sharer of his confidence and guilt, without having lifted the dagger against the defenceless stranger. Murdock is the chief of a gang of coiners, among whom is Sawney Macfile, whose vocation is that of a guide, to decoy unwary victims to the Fox and Goose.—Travellers are on the road; one, a stranger returning to his native village after a long absence; Murdock immediately plots his murder, when to the horror of Rose she discovers the iutended victim to be her own father! Filial piety induces her to resort to various expedients for his safety—draws the pistols with which they intend to perpetrate the murder—Murdock snaps the unloaded pistol—shots are fired from without—the robbers have fallen, and the grateful father is restored to his penitent child.

THEATRE, DRA7TON.
On If 'ED.FTSn.i T	EFJB.FJ.rf;, JFXT 30#*, 1834,
Will be performed a celebrated Play, founded on Truth, called
EUGENE ARAM.
This beautiful Play is extracted almost literally from Mr. LYTTON BtJLYVER'S celebrated Novel of the same name, a work for intensity of interest, masterly conception of character, power of language, beauty and effect, will rarely find its parallel: th< adaptor has never resorted to his own language when he could avail himself of that of the Novelist.—A few of the Remarkable FACTS on which both Novel and Play are founded are briefly these: EUGENE ARAM, then a Schoolmaster at Knaresborough» with RICHARD HOUSEMAN and DANIEL CLARKE, agreed to defraud several persons of goods, and plate, which Clarke waa to borrow for the alledged purpose of making a shew at his marriage, and a great quantity was accordingly obtained; some suspicious circumstances appearing that night, caused a rumour in the town next morning that Clarke was gone off, and upon enquiry it could not be learned what was become of him, search was immediately made for the goods and plate he had got, when a small part of It was found at Houseman's, and another part, some velvets, &c. were dug up in Aram’s garden, but as no plate was found it was Concluded that Clarke had gone off with it, search was made for him, he was advertised in all the public papers, but to no purpose, nothing was discovered touching Clarke’s murder for Thirteen Years, when a labourer digging for limestone, near Knaresborough, turned up part of a Skeleton, which was supposed to be Clarke’s, which suspicion subsequently proved to be erroneous, it turns out upon th« strongest circumstantial evidence that Aram was the real Murderer.—The whole transactions are beautifully developed in this Play.

THEATRE, DRAYTON.
On MONDAY Evening, MAY 4th, 1835,
Will be presented, the moral and instructire Tragedy, of
George	liar meed ;
Or, The LONDON MERCHANT.
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation, was founded on facts. The unfortunate hero of the piece was executed for the murder of bis virtuous and venerable Uncle, in the reign of Qaeen Elizabeth, to which be was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned Woman, who step by step led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence, by the most ignominious death.
A story is recorded, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a young gentleman of the City of London, having embezzled part of his master's property, was providentially at the representation of George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when that admirable actor Mr. Ross personated the character of George Barnwell, at whose fate he was so struck that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The gentleman so benefitted by this excellent Tragedy, wai not ashamed to own his obligation U» the Play and Performer ; for at every subsequent yearly benefit Mr. Ross received a Hundred Pounds Sterling, with a card to the following effect. « Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, for more than life—for til* redeemed honour and credit—begs your acceptance of the inclosed ; which sum you shall receive yearly, as long as you continue -u your profession. Happy am I to acknowledge that the Stage bas prevented me from ruin and disgrace ; George Barnwell h»s stopped me in my mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death.”
A celebrated and learned divine observes, that Fathers and heads of Families, whose duty is to watch and guide the morals of the rising generation, would do well to permit young people under their direction, to be present at the performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which Instruction is blended with Amusement.

On FRIDAY	8th, 1835,
Will be performed, the excellent and moral Play, of The
Gamester
<®r, the ¿false dfrtenUr,
Written by Dr. Moore. In the progress of this admirable Play, the finest feelings of the human breast are -nately roused to the highest pitch of tenderness and the very acme of distress ! The language is energetic and sublime ! The circumstances described, are those of an amiable family plunged into the most agonizing affliction, by the destructive practice of Gaming. To curb this vice and guard against its evils, becomes the duty of the Moralist and Public Lecturer, though none can so effectually picture its enormities as those “ Who hold the Mirror up to nature, who shew vice its own image, and the very age and body of the time its form and pressure.”
Hence may the Gamester learn, ere yet too late, To shun that Vice which endless ills await; Wild as the Sea his maddening passions flow, Himself, Wife, Children, beggar’d at a throw.
Oh ! should a Father or a Husband come,
Whom Dice have lured from happiness and home, To listen to our tale—our hope is here,
To check one Gamester in his mad career.

On FRIDAY Evening, MAY loth, 1835,
Will be performed, the popular Tragedy of
nneujviwim.
. There is not in History, ancient or modern, a story of deeper woe—one that exhibits a more exalted picture of true greatness— than the portion of Roman History on which this Tragedy is founded. The Tale is simple and grand, and full of dramatic interest. Great as was the sacrifice that Brutus made, by devoting his Son to the violated laws of Rome, far greater was that of Virginiut, who was reduced to the dreadful alternative of sacrificing his Daughter’s honour to the lust of the Decemviri Appius, or striking the deadly steel into her heart. He chooses death rather than dishonour: his decision is noble—sacred be his sorrows—reverenced be the example of such God-like virtue !
Mr. Knowles is the only tragic writer of the present day worthy to treat so noble a subject as the death of Virginia. The leading incidents of the Drama are strongly and powerfully depicted :—The playful domestic scenes of Virginius and bis Daughter ; Virginia being betrothed to Icilius ; Virginius’ departure for the wars; in his absence, his Daughter is claimed by Claudius, and dragged through the streets as his slave; Virginius is apprized of the claim, and hastens home; his confronting Appius; the Trial Scene, in which Appius decrees Virginia to be the slave of Claudius; she is about to be torn from her father, when Virginius, driven to desperation, state her to the heart.—The 5th Act opens with the arrest and imprisonment of the Tyrant; Virginius, bereft of reason by his Daughter’s death, forces himself into his dungeon, whom in his madness he strangles; his friends place the urn containing his Daughter's heart before him ; he looks at it—breathes the lov’d name, Virginia—and expires!

Will open on TUESDAY Evening, the 26th of JULY, 1836,
*#ml every Evening during the Week,
WITH A VARIETY OF
/Splendid ^elegant Entertainments
Which are quite different to (hose of a Theatrical description ; and on this account, together with their surprising ingenuity, and harmless tendency, are particularly calculated to attract the uotice and support of those whose Religion forbids their participation in amusements of a more decisive character.
The Exhibition consists of beautiful representations of the most interesting parts of the World, in the varying aspects of light and shade. On the Water will be introduced a variety of Shipping, Steam Boats, Ire. On Land and across the Bridges will he seen innumerable Figures of persons on foot and on horseback ; Carriages, Elephants, Camels, and a variety of other Animals moving with the greatest precision, and by the power of Mechanism display a perfect imitation of animated nature, which never fails to command the applause and admiration of every beholder, singularly instructive to youth, and highly gratifying to mature age.
PART I,-A VIEW OF
Along the Bridge of Arts will be seen, passing and repassing, a numer of Figures on Foot. The Pont Neuf, which represents the foreground, will be animated by Persons on Foot, on Horseback, and in Carriages, &c.
In this View will be seen a great variety of beautiful

£fie gUNtotfc Sportsman ISucft Shooting*
The Dog will he Seen to leap from the Boat, and return with the Duck m his mouth, which may be considered as the chef
d'ceuvre in the Art of Mechanism.
Also, a multiplicity of interesting Figures, which cannot be fully explained; the whole forming so near a resemblance to nature, as almost to cheat the Spectators into a temporary delusion of reality.
In this piece will be introduced a beautiful allegorical Representation of the
Birth of Venus,
In the presence of the assembled Gods and Godesses, on Mount Olympus, which will be arranged in the following Order:—
1—The Car of the Sea Nymph Galatea, drawn by Swans. 2.—The Car of Thetis, drawn by Dolphins, it.--The Car of Neptune drawn by Sea Horses, accompanied by Britannia, surrounded by Tritons, Sea Nymphs, &c. 4.—The Car of Amphitrite, (Daughter of Ocean and Wife of Neptune,) drawn by Dolphins. 5.—Doris, (Daughter of Ocean and Thetis,) in her Conch Shell.

Storm at Sea

In this Scene the efficiency of Captain Manby’s humane Invention for saving Shipwrecked Seamen, will be beautifully illustrated. It is impossible to describe this sublime spectacle, so as to convey to the mind an adequate idea of its interesting effect.
The whole painted by Mr. Abbot, Artist to the Exhibition, and will be accompanied by appropriate Music—Leader of the Band, Mr. Patterson, from the Theatre Royal, Dublin.

Ion9 the Devote«!.
This celebrated Play is now performing in London, and all the principal Country Theatres, with the greatest success. It was written by Serjeant Talfocrd, M. P., the celebrated Councillor, and for poetic merit and beauty of Language, is unrivalled in the present day :—It is founded on a remarkable event in Grecian History—the city of Argos being afflicted with the dreadful malady of the Plague, the Oracle is appealed to to stop the destruction, and the decree pronounced was—
“Argos ne’er shall find releasf.,
“Till it’s monarch’s race shall cease.”
Ion, (he Foundling, with other Conspiritors, pledge themselves to destroy the King to save the People : the moment Ion attempts the deed, he discovers the King to be his Father, who is then murdered by the other conspiritors, Ion is proclaimed King, and being the last of his race, devotes himself to death, and the Pestilence ceases.

With its other merits, the novelty of all the female characters dressed in the full costume of French Invincibles, going through the exercise, under the inspection of the Commandment of the Fort of Rovarge, (who thinks them troops, of the line) cannot fail to delight the admirers of the drama.

Pounded on some of the most remarkable events in the glorious reign of Queen Elizabeth, and was brought out under the patronage of the celebrated Earl of Chesterfield, who discovered in the humble Author (a journeyman brick-layer), merit and genius. The great success of the Play on it’s first representation proved his judgment right. The Author has deleniated the characters of Queen Elizabeth, the Earl of Essex, the Countess of Rutland, and other principal characters, in a masterly manner; developing in vivid colours, the powerful effects of Love, Jealousy, Ambition, and Revenge, on the human mind.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF
MRS. WOO».
On FRIDAY EVENING, MAY 26Hi, 1837,
Will be performed, the Moral and Instructive Tragedy of
George Barnwell:
Or, The London Merchant.
This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation, was founded on facts. The unfortunate hero of the piece was executed for llie murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to which he was instigated, by an artful, cruel, and abandoned Woman, who step by step led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence by a most ignominious death.
a story is recorded, (and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses), that a young gentleman of the City of London, ha\ ing embezzled part of his master's property, was providentially at the representation of George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when that admirable actor, Mr. Ross, personated the character of George Barnwell, at whose fate he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman so benifited by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to own his obligation to the day and the Performer; for at every subsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Ross received a Hundred Pounds Sterling with a card to the following effect. Dear Sir;—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, for more than life —for his redeemed honor and credit—begs your acceptance of the enclosed ; which sum you shall receive yearly as long as you remain in your Profession. Happy am I to acknowledge that the Stage has prevented me from ruin and disgrace, George Barnwell has stopped me ia mjr mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death.
A celebrated and learned divine observes, that Fathers and Heads of Families, whose duty it is to watch and guide the morals of th* Hiking generation, would do well to permit young people under their direction to be present at the performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which instruction is blended with amusement.

Lucy---Mrs. DUNCANSON.
" Be warn’d ye youths, who see my sad despair,
" Avoid lew’d wamen false as they are fair.”
This affecting Tragedy (the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation), is one of the plays revived last winter, in London. Shakspeajre says—
That guilty creatures sitting at a play j Been so struck to the soul that presently Have, by the very cunning of the scene, | They have proclaimed their malefactions.’*
When instruction can be blendid with amusement, every good parent will be anxious, every master desirous, every teacher will recommend, the attendance of his pupils. That it exhorts and stimulates the youth of both sexes to the practice of virtue, the greatest enemies of the Theatre cannot deny.
“ Learn to do well from others’ ill, and you shall do full well.”—Lillo.
Thii play was certainly founded on fact—the nnfortnnate hero of the tragedy, Georg. Barnwell, was executed for the murder of his venerable Uncle, to which he was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned woman, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; step by step, she led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence by a most ignominious death.

FIRST MGHT OF
JACK SHEPPARD,
Now performing throughout the United Kingdom, at the different Theatres, with unprecedented success.
On MONDAY, 15th JUNE, 1840,
WILL BE PERFORMED A NEW VERSION OF THE CELEBRATED HISTORICAL DRAMA, OF
SHEPPARD
OR, TRE HOUSEBREAKER OF 1703.	,
Adapted expressly for this Theatre, from the popular and well-known Novel by Mr. AINSWORTH.
I
NOTICE.—It is worthy of observation, that the peculiar, extraordinary, and widely-read Novel of JACK SHEPPARD, has been Dramatised for and Acted with a success unprecedented in the annals of Dramatic Literature, no less than in
SEVEN LONDON THEATRES,
Where it continues to be acted nightly, to the most numerous Audiences that were ever assembled within the walls of
a Theatre.
TO THE PUBLIC.—In the production of this extraordinary Drama, some apology, or explanation may be deemed necessary. In the Literary Gazette of October 21st, is an article which completely meets the question \—First, Is it necessary that every publication should be framed for the express purpose of pointing a moral ? Secondly, Does Jack Sheppard succeed or fail in this object? And, thirdly, D9 such subjects offer fair materials to exercise the talent of authors, and afford public gratification, without injury to the public mind ? To the first enquiry I think we are bound to concede, that much as we value moral inculcation, to addere to it as a cine qua non would be to exclude a multitude of amusing, playful, imaganitive, and innocent productions, which have ever been the ejoyment of cultivated society. To the second the reply would be, that, so long as human nature is human nature, and there is guilt as well as virtue, it may be as expedient to explore the lower and darker recesses of villany, as to develope the stilted crimes of tragedy in high places. Nay, as the former immediately affect and come in contact with the vast majority of our fellow-creatures, it is the more expedient to put the ignorant many on their guard against the seductions bf common vice, and the invasions of bold brutality. The main point, therefore comes, after all, to the treatment of the theme. Are we made to feel a deeper concern for the scoundrel and the murderer, than for the whronged and good—is criminality made prosperous, and honor and honesty (alas 1 too often -suffering in the real world) held up to disregard and odium i But we find none of these offences in Jack Sheppard! and as Fielding has chosen Jonathan Wild as his “great man," to barb the keenest shafts of irony against crime, so we do think Mr. Ainsworth has, in an entirely different and more popular manner, elected his ruifian victim, Jack Sheppard, to demonstrate that there is no mortal nulla virtuie redemtum: that depravity, however covered by bravado, is sure to entail compunction and punishment; and that as uneqnal are the fates of the bad and good, the preponderance of suffering rests with the former, and the balance of even earthly comfort with the latter class. Our author has curiously, though incidentally, supported his view, by supposing that Hogarth took the hint of his vigorous and impressive lesson of Industry and Idleness, (in the two apprentices) from seeing Jack Sheppard previous to his execution, when his portrait was painted 1>y Sir James Thornhill: may not we also guess that something of Mr. Ainsworth’s story might have been suggested by Hogarth's pictures; See Cruickshank’e iuimatable procession of Sheppard to Tyburn; the buffoonery, the riot, the orgies, the triumph of Sin, the incitement to rapine and bloodshed ; and compare them with the sad and solemn adminstration of the law, the change effected within a century ; and say whether the upholding of the past to censure is not calculated to expedite*the future? In fine. Jack Sheppard is
To all an example ■■	— ■ =.....To no one a pattern, .
and an ignominious death is the just reward of an atrocious life. The touches of remorce and repentance with which it has pleased Mr. Ainsworth to invest his closing career, and worthy of mneb commendation, not only as finishing the humanity of his conception, but as doing homage to the invincible principles of conscience and retribution.

On WEDNESDAY EVENING, APRIL 5, 1843,
Will be performed, Lillo’s celebrated Domestic Tragedy of
GEORGE
BARNWEU
Or, the London Merchant.
This affecting Tragedy (the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation) is founded on fact. The unfortunate hero of the Piece was, in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, to which he was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned woman. Step by step she led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence by a most ignominious death.
A story is reported, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a young gentleman of the City of London, having embezzled part of his master’s property, was providentially (at the representation of George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when the admirable actor Mr. Moss, personated George Barnwell,) so struck with the fate of Barnwell, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman benefited by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to own his obligation to the Play, and the Performer, for at every subsequent yearly benefit Mr. Moss received a Hundred Pounds sterling, with a card to the following effect:—
"Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell for more than life—for his redeemed honour and credit—begs your acceptance of the enclosed, which sum you will receive yearly as long as you continue in your profession. Happy am I to acknowledge that the Stage has preserved me from ruin and disgrace. George Barnwell stopped me in my mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death.—I am, &c.	“A Convert.”
A celebrated Divine observes, that “fathers and heads of families, whose duty it is to watch over the morals of the rising generation, would do well to permit young people under their direction to be present at the performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which instruction is blended with amusement.”

SPECTRE OF THE BLEEDING NUN.
This Melo-drama is founded on the most beautiful part of Mr. G. LEWIS’S celebrated Romance of THE MONK. The piece commences with the departure of Don Raymond irom his father’s Castle; he arrives in Madrid; falls in love with the beautiful Agnes, who is about to return from the Convent to her native Chateau; Don Raymond is determined on following, her Father being a particular friend of his family ; in this determination he sets out with his faithful Theodore for
THE BLACK FOREST,
Where by the villany of the Postillion the Carriage breaks down, and he is decoyed into a Wood-cutter’s Cottage, which proves to be a retreat for Banditti, the terror of the neighbouring Country. After a variety of interesting circumstances, (wherein the life of the young Chevalier is frequently attempted,) Raymond’s suspicions are entirely confirmed by the contrivances of Marguerite the Robber’s wife; and he discovers at the bed where the treacherous Robert leads him to repose,
THE CLOTHES AND PILLOW STAINED WITH BLOOD ! !
Drenched from the heart of many a murdered Traveller ; he resolves to defend himself to the last, and with the aid of Marguerite, eludes their present machinations; but unfortunately Agnes and her attendance are likewise betrayed into the fatal Cottage ; the villians are about to assassinate them all! and to that end administer a sleeping portion in their drink—but Heaven in compassion to the innocent, ultimately leads them in safety to the Castle of Lindenberg. The Baron however, averse to the presence of Raymond, banishes him the Chateau. In the midst of the despair which this circumstance occasions, Raymond receives a billet from the lovely Agnes, couched in the following terms:—
“When the Castle Bell tolls One, Expect me as the Bleeding Nun.”
To enter into further details of the Scenery, would be to rob the Spectators of much of their pleasure which
the unexpected events will give.

EOR THE BENEFIT OE
Mrs. CLIFFORD,
Who in announcing her Benefit, begs to return her sincere thanks for former Patronage, and on this occasion ventures most respectfully to solicit a continuance of those favours so liberally bestowed, to merit and obtain which
will be her constant endeavour.
On Wednesday Evening, April 3rd, 1844,
The Performances of the Evening will commence with the very excellent and highly applauded MeloDrama, called
Or, the ORPHAN of GENEVA.
WITH APPROPRIATE SCENERY.
’Tis enough, perhaps, to announce to the Public, in favour of this most interesting Drama, that the Critics have pronounced it the most perfect Piece of the present style of Dramatic taste, which is sufficiently proved by its unequalled success at the Theatre Royal, Dbury Lane, where it has already been repeated nearly 100 Nights, and still continues to be performed with increasing interest and popularity.—The feelings of a British Audience must always be powerfully excited by the action of this Drama, which exhibits a persecuted and helpless Orphan, (Therese,) extricated from the powerful toils of Villany, by the virtuous Instrument of Providence; with the punishment of such daring and triumphant guilt as is manifested by (Cabwin,) a wicked Advocate, perverting those laws, Society expects him to guard, and oppressing the weak, which it is his duty to defend. Who, in the wild delirium of his guilty Career, murders an unoffending Lady, mistaking her for the Orphan, whose destruction he is most resolute to accomplish. At the MOMENT OF THE MURDER A THUNDERBOLT strikes the Pavxllion where the crime is perpetrated, which is immediately seen in dames, and for awhile the Innocent is permitted to suffer for the Guilty; 'till at length, Justice, tho’ slow, overtakes the Wretch, who, subdued and conscience-struck, resignes himself to the Fate he had prepared for his Victim.
