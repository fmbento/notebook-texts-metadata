---^.*ah.l©.t«.e-...—
On WEDNESDAY EVENING, JUNE 17, 1807,
Will be reprefented, the much-admired Tragedy of

THE

REGENT:

Or, Usurper Defeated.
The expofition cf thofe pafiions which moll prejudice human nature,
which, when in full pofiefiion of the heart, piecipitate us into the molt
violent and irreparable afts, is noble employment for a Dramatic Author's
pen. In this attempt Greetham has fucceeded admirably. The fcenes
poflefi a ftrong and continued interelr, a charm of language extremely
powerful, and feveral original and affecting dramatic fituations. The
treacherous Manuel, after prevailing on Gomez, his brother, to afiaffinate
the King Anlaldo, peifecutes his unfortunate widow by his unworthy palfion.
Her maternal anguifli at length predominates—Manuel threatens to deltroy
her fun, the Heir Apparent—the gates of the prifon are thrown open—the
child is extended on the block, when Anf.ildo appeals—the child is refcued,
and Manuel receives the reward of his villainy.

Will be prefented, Shakefpear's celebrated Tragedy, of

Macbeth,
KING OF SCOTLAND.

In which will be introduced the original Music, Machinery, Decorations, See.
The Immortal author was never more remarkable for the dignity of chancier, tHe
ftrcngh of hisexpreflion, the elevition of Imtentimenc and the natural beauty of his imagery, than in the prodtrtWsn »f this excellent piece. It records a molt importiint part of
niftory, commenting with the defeat of that very dtngcrous rebel Macdonald, the execution of the Thane of Cawdor, and the treacherous prngnoitic. of the Witches of the blafted
heath, which afterwards prompt tile horrid murder of tht King hy Macbeth and I.ady,
while guefts ar the Callle of lnvernefs. The murder ol'B inquo neit takes place,and the
appearance of liis gholl K the Royal Banquet, 1'lieflightof Macduff to the Englith Court,
which oecafions the flaughtrr of his wife and children at Fife, by order of the inhuman
tyrant Macbeth, who in the mean time was haunted by the fevcral Apparitions of AN
ARMED CHILD rising from the Earth, and EIGHT KINGS—And in conclusion,
being blocked up by the Englilh Forces, hearing of lib Lady's death,and the equivocating
predictions of evil fpirits being now all fulfilled, in the removal of Birnam Wood to Dunfiimie's high Hill, and encoun-crtd perl'rtnally by one not born of woman,—this bloody
prodigy of the North appears abandoned to the hell of del'pair and guilt, and juftly fall, unpitied ami abhorred.

REGENT;
Or, Usurper Defeated.
The expofition of thofe paffions which nioft prejudice human nature,
which, when in full pofleffion of the heart, precipitate us into the molt
violent and irreparable acts, is noble employment for a Dramatic Author'*
P e n - In this attempt Greathead has lucceeded admirably. The fcene*
poflTeft a ftrong and continued intcreft, a charm of language extremely
powerful, and feveral original and affecting dramatic fituations. The
treacherous Manuel, after prevailing on Gomez, bis brother, to afiaffinate
the King Anfaldo, perfecutes his unfortunate widow by his unworthy pafllon.
Her maternal anguilh at length predominate.)—Manuel threatens to deltroy
her fon, the Heir Apparent—the gates of the priion are thrown open—the
Child is extended on the block, when Anfaldo appears—the child is refcued,
and Mauuel receives the reward of his villainy.

TAMERLANE

a. grateful treat to every Patriot; as it forms a parallel to those Action., in which
am Wisdom, Influence and Courage, hold so conspicuous a share, and by which the
world is so happily restored to Peace.
TAMERLANE was ROWE'i second Play and favourite production; Thi.
partiality probably arose from the enthusiastic rapture with which it was received by
an audience who beheld—as the poet had designed they should—their own beloved
monarch in the person of the virtuous Tamerlane! and their old enemy of France,
An the reprobate Bajazet.
OF all the muse's various labours, none

Than those that tell the Fame by noble Heroes won. 3
High with the Names in Arms he siQod,

And fought, and suffered for bis Country's Good.

Yet .Sought not Fame, but Peace, ir Fields of Blood, j
Some abject States for bear the Tyrant join;
"%
Others for Cold their Liberties resign.

And Venal P r i . c n sold their Right Divine.

Till Heaven the growing Evil to redress.
Sent WELLINGTON to give the World a Pea«e.
The Hero rous'd asserts the glorious Cause,
And to the field the chearful Soldier draws
Thus fir'd. the Brave on to the Danger press.'

On FRIDAY next, JUNE 24, 1814,
Will be performed, the last new HISTOMCAL DRAMA, ;,, F i v e

TheMthwp:
O R , T H E CHILD OF THE DESERT.
(Written by W. DIMO*D, Esq. Author of Tht Foundlingof tit Form, Tht Royal Oaii
Adrian and Otilla, Guttavui Vaia, Pmant Boy, &c )
The historical trMi^actions repressed in this interesting Drama, form a part of t h .
Epoch when the great HAROUN ALKASCHID filled the Throne of the East; and the
Adventures here ascribed to him, however apparently improbable or impossible, are
strictly true, and such as the Historians and Poets of his own time and country have
stamped with unequivocal authority.
This Piece excited great interest with the Covent Carden audience, the mind being
kept in suspence, the development of the plot canuot be ascertained till the latt grand
Scene; when every circumstance that appeared th* work sf Magic is accounted for, and
has a wonderful effect.—An incident in the last scene, thought to border upon improbability, the author gives the followi.g historical fact for its defence:—"A Roma.
Emperor suspecting two of his Senators hid engaged in a plot against his life, called them
privately to his closet, there presenting to each of them a dagger ; he laid bare his bossm,
and bad. them strike if they believed his existence to be injurious to the State. The
Senators, overwhelmed by such magnanimity, cast themselves at Cassar's feet, and
humbly implored his mercy "

M. TBIODON
Begs to return Thanks for the Favours he has received, and to inform the Ladies and Gentlemen of Nottingham and its Vicinity, that as his Exhibition will close this Week, he will, during the remainder of his short Stay, offer a great Variety of new Entertainments, superior to
any that have ever yet been presented to the Public, and his utmost Exertions will be used to
please, and to give satisfaction to his auditors.
M. THIODON will exhibit

HIS MOST WONDERFUL

greats, of Drstrrttg,
After the Manner of the celebrated Olivier of Paris.
A detail of these Experiments, which will excite the surprise of the Spectators, cannot be conveyed in the Limits of a Hand Bill.
After the Experiments, the following PIECES
will be exhibited:
FIRST PIECE,

A VIEW OF

PORTO FERRAJO,
Capital of the ISLAND of ELBA.
TAKEN FROM WITHIN THE BAY; EXECUTED AFTER THE DESIGN OF CAPT. JAMES WEIR.

SECOND PIECE,

Valley de Torrent,
IN SWITZERLAND,
This Piece from its Romantic and Picturesque Scenery, richness of colouring, and the masterly style of its execution, is universallf
admired.

THIRD PIECE,

TMIMITT

BMI1DGE,

g

AT FLORENCE.
In addition to the number of inimitable Figures which animate this Piece, and which have
iiistlv caused it to be esteemed as the chef d' oeuvre in the Art of Mechanism, there will be introduced oil this Occasion, a beautiful Representation of an AQUATIC EXHIBITION on the

TO CONCLUDE WITH

A STORM at SEA,
Areomoanied with all the characteristic Phenomena—an agitated Sea—Clouds, which, by degreei, obscure the Sky—Light,
• - T h u n d e r &c —Vessels beating against the Tempest, struck by a Thunderbolt, and engulphed u the Waves—finally, the
Seamen endeavouring to save themselves from the neighbouring Rocks, present a faithful Representation of Nature. In fact, it is
impossible to describe this Spectacle, so as to convey to the Mind an adequate idea of its interesting Effect.

The above Views will be animated by a great Number of Figures on Foot, on Horseback, in
Carriages, and also different Animals; and the various Movements, executed by the power of
Mechanism, are so natural, as to strike the Spectators with astonishment.
Doors will be opened at Half past Six, and the Exhibition will commence precisely at Half past Seven.

On MONDAY, AUGUST 11,1817,
Will be performed, Mrs, Inchbald's favourite Play (not acted here these five
Year,), called

Such Things Are;
Or, the BENEVOLENT BRITON.
The numerous acts of benevolence performed by that magnanimous philanthropist, John Howard, Esq. gave to Mrs. Inchbald (Authoress of this most
excellent Play) the Idea of depicting to the world, in a dramatic form, the happioe.s it is in the power of an individual to render to himself, by bestowing comfort
on the afflicted, and soothing the anguish of the wretched. Mr. Howard (represented in this Play as Haswcll) made it his pursuit to visit the different prisons in
this, a, well as other kingdoms, and to the utmost of his power extended to
worthy and distressed objects the blessings of liberty and happiness. It may
truly be said," such things are !" for an instancel is at this moment before our
-lew, in that humane and benevolent character, Mr.Webb, who now travels va»
rious parts of England, seeking objects for his charity.

any object the company pleases, from the floor, the roof, under chairs, tables,

of the door, as if an invisible agent was conversing with him : he can exercise the peculiar gift that he is endowed with, even while drinking a glass of
wine, a circumstance hitherto unknown to the scientific and curious; he
superadds a particular faculty, not exhibited in this or in any other kingdom
by any other Ventriloquist, of imitating the pleasing NOTES of BIRDS,

grand

Mel

° Drama, called

R O B E R T the BRUCE,
or the Battle of

Bannockburn.

The Melo Drama commences at the period when the question of rightful succession to the Throne of
Scotland being disputed by Robert Bruce, John Baliul, Cummin, and others; the matter in dispute wa«
referred to the arbitration of King Edward the First, of England. The progress of the piece represents
the greater part of the historical events from that time, until the great and decisive battle of Bannoclibum, aided with several interesting, although fictitious incidents. There is also an heroic event related
of Bruce's standard-bearer, who, having vonied never to part with his country's ensign until life forsook
him, was found, after the battle.amidst a heap of slain, with both arms broken, but, with the last struggle
of death, still retaining the standard between his teeth.—This incident has been faithfully preserved.

The whole to conclude with the interesting Drama of THE

M U R D E R E D MAID ;
or the Clock has struck Four f
This Drama is founded on a Murder which was committed in the Spring of 1817, and which created
on« universal feeling of horror and indignation. No trial was ever tainted with greater atrocity, or ever
ejcited greater interest and commiseration, nor was a victim ever to be found less deserving her fate,
than the unhappy Mary !—It is well known the BROTHER claimed the advantage of a Law recorded
in our ancient Ci'dt—" That after a trial is held, and the accused acquitted, if the said party be appealed,
he may rest his cause upon Wager of BatteL"—The accused has since emigrated to America; and great
was the general regret, that a person, whom there was too much reason to believe the perpetrator of this
dreadful act, was suffered to escape condign punishment.

The GENTRY and INHABITANTS in general of NOTTINGHAM and its Vicinity, are
respectfully informed, that these

Celebrated

Orientals

WILL EXHIBIT THEIR

Astonishing and Unrivalled Feats
Jit the EXCHANGE

ROOMS,

Nottingham.

These justly admired Characters, the only Performers that ever arrived

FROM THE EMPIRE

OF

CHUM,

And who have been brought to Europe by a Person attached to the late EMBASSY to the COURT of PEKIN,,
will display the greatest variety of surprising

Feats of Magical Deceptions and Dexterity,
Which are altogether Novel, and Unknown to the People of Europe.
They will go through their extraordinary Exhibition

In the following Order of Performances.
1st.—Throwing ahout T H R E E GILT BALLS, in various directions, with amazing
velocity, making them form circles of every denomination round the Head, Neck, Legs,
Arms, &c. horizontal, perpendicular, elliptic, &c. which to the eye appears apERPECT R I N G .
2nd.—Tossing up a LARGE CHINA BASIN lo the Ceiling, and catching it sideways
upon the flat of the Hand, then turning it upside down in various ways, making it appear
to the beholder as if glued to the Hand.—A very wonderful feat!
3rd.—The MAGICAL CHINA CUPS. This is a Feat entirely of Sleight of Hand,
which creates great wonder and amusement.
4th.—From under a Green Carpet, on which the Performers walk, and where it appears
impossible that anv thing can be concealed, an immense FLOWER P O T is produced,
and afterwards a LARGE BASIN is exhibited (as if by Magic) FULL OF WATER!
This is a Feat that has puzzled first-rate Magicians to account for, and none could ever
yet discover the means by which it is accomplished.
5th.—Several very curious and diverting Evolutions are performed with Three SMALL
STICKS, which are well worth the closest attention.
6th.—Upon an empty CHINA PLATE a SHOWER OF NUTS is made to fall from
an E M P T Y HANDKERCHIEF !
7th.—With Eight solid BRASS RINGS, in none of which can any break be discovered
one of the Artists performs several VERY CURIOUS TRICKS, namely, separating
them, and exhibiting, nay, handing them about singly for inspection among the Visitors,
and then at one touch, linking them together in various forms, sometimes like a Chain,
a pair of Spectacles, a Globe, &c. & c . ; then, with talismanic influence, shaking them
asunder on the floor.
8ih.—A large CHINA BOWL is thrown aloft and caught in its descent bottom downwards, on the point of a small Stick, where it is spun and tossed about with great velocity,
and to all appearance with a certainty of destruction.
9th.—Several astonishing Feats are performed with T H R E E LARGE KNIVES, which
are flung about with equal velocity with the Balls, and caught in such a way as to require
great steadiness of nerve to behold, without apprehension for the safety of the Performer.
10th
The spectators are highly amused by several pleasing and ingenious Deceptions
with China Tea Cups, in which RICE IS CHANGED INTO R E D BERRIES, Ac.
&c. and from one Cup (they are all of the same size) as much RICE is produced as will
fill two or three.
. „.,,
11th. At each end of a long Cord or Bowstring, is attached a large BRAbis iSALL.
With this Cord and Ball they perform with the most extraordinary Activity and management that can be conceived/ He makes these Balls fly round in every and opposite directions, each forming a separate and distinct Circle, he himself holding the cord in only one
hand'at the middle. "This display is very extraordinary and surprising
12th. One of the Performers eats a quantity of cut Paper, BLAZING ON t l R E ,
V which he afterwards, apparently with great pain,* discharges from his Mouth and Nostrils
in S M O K E ' AND,REAL FLAMES, He then drkv^. from his Mouth at least One
Hundred yards of White Riband, and afterwards as many more yards of Red Riband.
This is a very wonderful Feat.
.., •• # ,
13th. A great quantity ot the shreads of White Paper is cut small, and put in a IJasin
of Water covered up, which on removing the cover, is discovered to be a perfect String of
Red Paper of nearly a Hundred Yards.

attempts to assassinate Horatio, but is fortunately prevented by the arrival of Surge, who
informs them the enemy is just approaching. Mandeville urges Horatio to depart,

decreed—when Mandeville, by accident, drop, the portrait, which he had seized from
Horatio during the fight—Zaluch enters and perceives it—questions Mandeville as to how

in the enlightened City of Edinburgh, Mr. I. flatters himself, that the Inhabitants of this Town will believe
that he is able to entertain those Ladies and Gentlemen who may honour him with their Company ; he also
begs they will excuse him for putting so little in his Bill, as there are many travelling the Country with large
Bills, who have not Merit to entertain Children. He takes the liberty to mention a few Deceptions out

AS TO THE CARDS, HE CAN AND WILL MAKE THEM DO ANY THING BUT SPEAK!!!

The Coronation of his Majesty King George the

Fourth,

AND THE EVER MEMORABLE BATTLE OF

TRAFALGAR.

In these magnificent Works of the Artist are given correct Views of the Coronation and Procension, together with five interesting View,
of the ever memorable BATTIS of TI.AVAI.OAR. The Ship, of War are to be seen the largest ever delineated on Canvass, and the Officers and
Men represented in striking Likenesses the Size of Life. The whole painted by the first Masters, on about 16,000 square Feet of Canvass.

V I E W I. T H E CORONATION.
The interior of Westminster Abbey, at the interesting moment the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the Crown upon the Head of his Majesty. The Dukes, Princesses, Duchesse., Earls, Knights, Judges, Bishops, Gentlemen Pensioners and Serjeants at Arms standing. The intermixture of splendid C.stumes, with the ancient and beautiful Architecture of that noble Gothic Pile, produces the most magnificent effect
possible for the human Mind to conceive: the Spectator may almost fancy himself present at the Ceremony.

PROCESSION.
II. The grand Procession returning from the Abbey to the Hall, advancing along the Royal Platform, covered with Matting and Purple
Cloth, beyond which are Galleries filled with thousands of Spectator.,
In the centre is his Majesty, conspicuously prominent, wearing his Crown of State and Robes of Velvet; his Train born, by eight eldest Sons
of Peers, immediately under the Golden Canopy, supported by Barons of the Cinque Ports, followed by Tcomen of the Guard.
III. An accurate Representation of the Interior of Westminster H a * at the moment of the entry of the Champion, and while he is giving
the challenge. It i. impossible to describe the singular effect and beauty of this Scene: the magnificent triumphal Arch, and the chivalrous
effect produced by the Champion completely clad in Steel, the Lord High Constable and Earl Marshal of England on their beautiful Charger.,
form a lout en semble seldom, if ever, surpassed.

I V — T H E CITY AND BAY OF CADIZ,
With the Combined Fleets of the Enemy under weigh, and all the Fort, and Batteries that defend the City are seen in the distance.
V, The BRITISH FLEET, under the Command of Admiral NELSON and Lord COLLINQWOOD, bearing down in two Columns on

On a Lake of F i r e and Water,

In the E X C H A N G E ROOMS, Nottingham.
The Entertainment, offered at this Place, are quite different from those of a Theatrical descrip-.
tion; and on this account, together with their surprising ingenuity and harmless tendency, a r .
particularly calculated to attract the notice and support of those, whose religious Tenets forbid
their participation in Amusements of a more marked and decisive character.
J. F. THIODON, remembering with gratitude the distinguished notice that his Theatre excited on hisfirstvisit t .
Nottingham, in 1817, most respectfully acquaints the Nobility, Gentry,, and the Public in general, that he has made con•iderable Improvements, and increased the Variety, with respect both to PAINTING and MECHANISM.
To tho« whom M. T. has not had the honour of reckoning among his Spectators, it may be necessary to add, that hit
Theatre is composed of beautiful Representations of celebrated

Cities, Landscapes, Sea and River Views. Ac.
ENLIVENED

BT FIGURES OF PERSOSS, SHiPPING, CARRIAGES,
HORSES,
And other Animals, with varying aspects of Light and Shade;
All the Actions and Movements representing Nature, as much as the art of Mechanism will permit, which cannot Jail to
deserve universal approbation. The effects are produced neither by Transparencies, nor by flat Scene Painting, but from
the mo.tfinishedModels.

To conclude with the interesting Melo Drama, called

PROGRAMME.
A rivalry existing between two Forest Hunters, Rodolpli and William, the former invokes the potent assistance of Zamiel, the Spirit of the Forest, who grants him SEVEN MAGIC
B U L L E T S ; the properties of which are unerring aim. For this gift, Rudolph enters on a
compact with Lucifer's agent, Znmiel; the period of Rodolph's existence depending only
upon the retaimnent of the Seventh Ball. Previous to the rising of the Curtain, three
Bullets are supposed to have been expended ; the fourth wins the prize of Rangership from
William; the fifth is employed to entrap him at an Eagle, which is seen to hover in the air,
at an immeasurable height—William discharges it, and, unconscious of its power, brings the
Eagle to the ground—William perceives his astonishment, and taking advantage of such,
entices him to the WOLF's GLEN, intending to seduce him to the acceptance of seven
charmed Bullets, the possession of which would hind William as Zamiel's victim, and afford
a new term of life to Rodolph. The HORRORS of WOLF's G L E N are then developed.

That if you wish to die for love, you may.

Two Elegant Automatons,
At large as Nature, the one representing a leavtiful POLONESE
: the other a little BOY.
Nothing can surpass the admirable construction of these Pieces. The large Figure seems almost endowed with human faculties, exhibiting the usual feats of a Rope-Dancer, in the fullest imitation of life. The small Figure

A J U V E N I L E ARTIST I
The figure of a Boy, who with every action of Real Life, will execute in presence of the Company, specimens of
Writing and Drawing, superior to the best specimens of the iirst Masters : if this figure were destitute of motion
it would be picturtMpie, but when with the ease and elegance of a well educated Youth, it unites the power of producing such perfect imitation of Nature, as almost to sanction the Greek Mythology, when, speaking of figures formed out of sordid clay, which touched by Prometheus, started ihto life, and, extraordinary as the Fable appears, it
is equalled, if not surpassed, by the wonderful mechanism of this Figure,

an #ttr Hccrowanccr,
VI ill, by his elaborate Mechanical Combinations, resolve Enigmas, and with apparent Magical Power, answer the
most complex (Juestions.

THE LITTLE SPANIARD,
Vi ill Daivc and Play on his Instrument.
The multiplied combination of its interior construction, will highly
gratify the curiosity, and give u correct idea of the Mechanism of the large one.

A Bird of Paradise,
Which starts from a Superb Gold Box, warbles the most melodious Notes, and returns to its concealment in the
Box. The effect of this Piece of Mechanism may be gaid without exaggeration, to be enchanting ; and for delicacy of Workmanship, stands unrivalled.

TO WHICH WILL BE ADDED, SEVERAL ORIGINAL, ASTONISHING, AND
UNPARRALELED EXPERIMENTS IN THE

Science of Optics,
Under the Sanction of His Majesty's Royal Letters Patent,
An Etitert.ifnn.ient which has been honored with the Patronage of the R O Y A L F A M I L Y , as well as characters
of the first Rank and Distinction in England : and, although many spurious Copies of the Invention have appeared
m the principal cities in Great Britain, the Inventors conscious of the superiority of the O R I G I N A L , have no hesitation iu flattering themselves to meet with that Protection and Support, peculiar to the sensibility and discernment
of a Nottingham Audience:
The Proprietor will introduce, among a variety of Subjects, I D E A L P E R S P E C T I V E

PROSPECTS of the ELYSIAN FIELDS,
And other V I E W S . The Effect produced, as if lightened by the M O O N , in which different &KI AL S P I R I T S
am) S H A D E S of great Men wiil ernei*ge and appear, being a Master-piece of the Science of O P T I C S ; and of
which the utmost Efforts of Imitators have been unable to produce the faintest Resemblance, fee.
The whole to finish with a series of brilliant Mechanical and Optical

Fire-Works,
Displayed in succession in the centre of a Arbour.

BEASTALL

AND

FEARN

Most respectfully return their Acknowledgments for the very distinguished Patronage
and Support they have received, and at the same time beg to announce to their Friends
and the Public, that their Theatre will continue open every Evening during the ensuing
Week, when every effort will be made to render the Exhibition as interesting as possible.
THE WHOLE IS ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE MUSIC.

On MONDAY EVENING, April 23d, and throughout the Week, will be exhibited,
A VARIETY OF NEW VIEWS, FIGURES, & c &c.
FIRST PIECE.

A BEAUTIFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE, AT

UMWW

.

This manificent Structure, which, with the Dock adjoining, cost upwards of 397,000 Pounds, is 373 feet in
length, and 295 in depth, and is reckoned the most sumptuous edifice of the kind in Europe. A superb
Dome surmounts the whole 125 feet in height, on the top of which is a Statue of Hope, 16 feet high, resting
on her Anchor.—It is seated on the River LIFFBY, in which will be seen a number VESSELS UNDER SAIL.
A variety of Mechanical Figures will be introduced, on Foot, on Horseback, and in Carriages, with

The IA/t/)/ and Beggar;

and the Wonderful Donkeys,

One orwhicjj gives a summerset to his Rider, Jack Tar, which may be considered the
Chefs d'oeuvre in the Art of Mechanism.

SECOND PIECE.

A m&mwm ®mwm vusw m tram

City, and Bay of Naples,
Capital of the Kingdom of NAPLES,

in Italy.

It is most delightfully situated on the above Bay of the Mediterranean Sea, which is very extensive, and
presents an almost unrivalled assemblage of beautiful and Picturesque Scenery. The Houses are generally
six or seven stories high, stuccoed; are flat roofed, and often covered with boxes filled with flowers & shrubs,
JOSEPH BUONAPARTE was proclaimed King of Naples in 160G, and on his removal to Spain, the Crown
was conferred on MURAT. In the Spring of 1815, Naples was surrendered to the British Troops; and on
the 17th of June, King FERDINAND re-entered his Capital after an absence of Nine Years.—The Population arfiounts to 339,000.—A great deal of Shipping will appear in the Bay, some of which, on passing the
Fort, will Fire, and receive the accustomed return Salutes.—In the distance will be seen

Mount Vesuvius, in a state of Eruption.
The Sportsman with his Dogs, who willjire his Gun, with a report as large as a Pistol.

AND HIS ARMY.

The sides of the terrific Mountain of ST. BERNARD are perpetually covered with Ice and Snow, and surrounded with dreadful precipices, which seem to defy all human efforts to force a practicable passage, yet

NAPOLEON

is seen to lead an ARMY of 30,000 Men, with Artillery, Baggage, #c.

Cannon was dismounted, arid put in troughs hollowed out of trees, cut for the purpose, drawn by groups of
Infantry, wheels fixed to poles, and carried on the shoulders of men, with caissons, tumbrels, and axle-tree,
on sledges, and mules laden with ammunition. At the summit of the Mountain is a MONASTERY, founded for
the generous purpose of granting relief to unfortunate and bewildered Travellers, who might otherwise bt
doomed to perish in the snow. The cold is excessive, even in the summer season, with scarcely a vestige of
vegetation to be discerned. The imagination is affrighted by a perpetual silence, and the view astonished by
an almost endless perspective of Mountains. The Monks take great pains to instruct the canine species to
reduce the accidents peculiar to this place. Morning and Evening, dogs are sent out, and if they meet any
unfortunate creature, they immediately return with symptoms of distress, and the Monks fix a small basket of
provision, round their necks, which they carry to poor sufferers, with proper persons following after, to give
necessary assistance.

Most respectfully informs the Nobility, Gentry, and Public of Nottingham, and its Vicinity, that it is his
intention t o give S I X E V E N I N G S O N L Y of his G R A N D and S P L E N D I D E N T E R T A I N M E N T ,

Emperor of Austria ; King of Prussia ; his much lamented Royal Highness Prince Frederic Duke of York
•nd Albany, Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty's forces; Right Honorable Earl of Liverpool ; Earl of
Harrowby ; Lord G . Lennox ; Lord Pawlet, of the 85th Regiment; Lord Hill and Major Badcock, of the

insert; and on Wednesday, January 4 , 1816, before the Lord and Lady Mayoress', at their seat, Kingstonupon-Thamcs, Surrey, flatters himself he shall receive patronage and support on this occasion.
S. B . ever mindful of the gratitude that is due to a liberal and discerning Public, for its generous and
powerful support, most respectfully offers his sincere acknowledgments for the same, and humbly trusts
he shall ever be honorably entitled to continuance, as it as ever been the highest summit of his hopes and
wishes to merit and obtain it. Public encouragement is a sure stimulus to genuine exertion, and imperiously
rails forth every species of talent which Nature in her wonted gifts, so powerfully and eventually displays.

Emperor & Grand Arch Master of all Conjurors.

SCENE 1.—-Exhibits

the EARTH in ANNUAL'and DIURNAL MOTION:—
Day, Night, Twilight, long1 and Short Days, the Seasons, Year, &c. are rendered so plain and intelligible, that a bare Inspection of the Machine explains
their Cause to any Capacity. These Phenomena are explained on a Trans*
parent Globe, Two Feet Diameter; and the Rotundity of the Earth, and its
Habitation on all "udes, by one of ^ix Feet.
SCENE II.—Exhibits the EARTH and the M O O N ; in which the Causes of her
different; Phases, or Change of Appearance—her Eclipses, and those of the
c^un with the View of her Disc, as seen by the most powerful Telescopes,
are the principal Features.
SCENE III—Has every PLANET and SATELLITE in ANNUAL and DIURNAL MOTION at once:—a COMET descends in the Parabolic Curve
frota the Top of the Machine, having its Motion accelerated and retarded
accordW to the Laws of Planetary Motion.
SCENE IV, •• 'he PROBABLE CONSTRUCTION of the UNIVERSE, exhi' (Siting
