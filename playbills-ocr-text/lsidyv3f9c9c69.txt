To-morrow, the Tragedy of B \ R B AROSSA. the Part of Achmet by the YOUNG ROSCIUS.
After which (bv particular de-fire) the New Operatic Piece of MVFR1MONY. fclj* A New COMEDY, in Five \Cts, mill be produced in the courfe of a few Days,
f .	/a1 It't <-i DRURY-LANE*
On Tuesdays considerable disappointment was : felt at this theatre by the absence of the Young Roscius, who was labouring under so severe a cold and hoarseness that he was unable to appear on the stage.
Previously to opening theTheatre, at which he was announced to perform Achmet, for the second time, a bill was distributed, stating that the play was unavoidably changed to the Wonder—containing two notes, one from the father of young Betty, and another from Dr. Pearson, dated Tuesday, addressed to Mr. Wrouhton, in which the physician writes :—
On beiag called in to Marter Betty yesterday, I did not con.iderlns indisposition of such a nature as to justify my ' iuteriererice m.h his earnest desire not to d.sappomt the public, by changing the pedurmance advertised for this evening. But this morning 1 am decidedly of opinion, that he cannot, without the greatest ,'uizasd, attempt to appear en the stage this evening.
The impression made by these notes had the effect of sending some few of those back to their homes who had come with a view of seeing the performance originally announced. A very respectable audience, however, continued to witness the performance of the Wonder, and the fascinations of Mrs. Jordan in Violante.
Before the rising of the curtain, Mr. Wrougston came forward to apologise to the audience for their d »appointment. He added, that, with a view to a perfect re-establishiner„t cf the Young Roscius, be
would not appear agai 1 until after the Christmas Holidays, the Proprietors of the theatre being determined to look to his health as their first Object. This address waf much applauded, and the performance proceeded without any interruption.
We have the satisfaction of announc’ng to the public th.-t the Young lloscius is now much better; it is hoped he wll resume his performances immediately after Christinas. We understand he has eight more nights to perform at Drury-lane in January, and six at Covent-garden; after which, should his popularity continue, of which indeed' there seems little doubt, this infant prodigy will return to Drury-lane, and remain there till the conclusion of the season.
It is now necessary that the Managers should-bring him forward in some other characters. Ach-met is a toilsome and uninteresting paft ; Frederick in Lovers’ Vr,cs, is a bad put 1 and Douglas should be economised. Let us now sec him in so«e of Shakespeare’s Plays, which are properly the touchstone of the taste, judgment, and powers of a performer.
As his scope is wide and his ambition lofty, let the Managers, when his strength shall be recruited, and his talents undepressed by indisposition and fatigue, exhibit him in Hamlet and Richard. Report speaks highly of his performance in these parts. If he succeeds, an effectual answer is given to those who wish to discred.t his reputation, and persuade the towa that their raptures are misplaced, and that
their applauses are only lavished on a pleasing novelty ; if he should not succeed, admiration, in its generous extravagance, has only outrun the boupds of reason, and characters will still be found in which he can give no ordinary pleasure.
At all events, -we are delighted with the respite which has been given him—The liberality of the Drury-lane Managers, of Mr. Sheridan parti-cu’arly, is much to be commended; they outwent the desire of the boy, of his father, and his physician ; they exceeded even the necessity of the case.
—They have given him his holidays, and we hope they will be pissed in that quiet and" leisure which i* most likely to confirm his health.
i We have heard that he is to pass his Christtrae with the Duke of Clarence.—There indeed he will find a friendly and maternal haven in the cares and at:e. tions of a lady of a sympathising mind, and of an eminence in the public opinion equally marked and natural as his own.
. We eagerly desire his complete restoration, and wish to see the day when the judgment of the public will at last speak, unbiassed by the tumults of a phasing novelty, and v-ben there will be no controversy respecting his merit, but who shall best reward it.
The new Comedy, entitled The Land We Lice In, is to be produced immediately after Christmas, to which time the Proprietors have thought it their in- . terest to defer it.—In the force of wit and humour, together with knowledge of life, and original vigour of dialogue, it is said to be of the Congreve scho d, and in the opinion of tha first dramatic judges, to some of whom it has been shewn, has in these particular*-scarcely had its equal since.
DRURY-LANE.
Oh Monday the Young Roscius appeared it this theatre in the character -of Douglas, which he r:-peated on Thursday.—We have nothing to add t ■ our former comments on his performance of f ■■ part.	-¿-ci- l ft t,
His popularity has risen with the frequency of tu performances, and places are engaged a week in advance, and almost at any hazard, to witness his astonishing exhibitions.
We strictly abide by our former j udgment in every thing we have written concerning him.
The Heiress has been revived at this house. We well remember the author; a gsntleman of extensive knowledge of life and manners, and of great literary taste and polite learning.
The Heiress was much admired in its day; and, as coming from a man so generally beloved, was, . perhaps, valued more than it deserved. It became, in a manner, the ton to see and applaud it; and as it was really elegantly and vigorously written, praise, which had so plausible a foundation, was confounded with the approbation of sober, reflecting judgement, and it was expected that the plaudits which W ere lavished upon its first run, would ba renewed when the author should cease to influence them by fashion, and when people discontinue to clap only when they were bidden.
But time puts to flight such illusions, and the Heiress must now stand upon its own merits. The dress boxe9 must now be tenanted by Ladies who knew not the author; and his mercer and his tailor must now pa}' for their stations in the pit and gallery. It is therefore only applauded as it is liked, and pleasure is only expressed as it is received.
The Heiress, we must therefore declare, can never .be a popular comedy; it can never be received on the Stock List.	.
It wants the first ingredient of popular comedy— humour : it wants nature, for such beings as Gay-ville, Cl/ford, agd Lady Emily, are never seen.
The fable is that of a novel, and the dialogue is too heavy and laboured; it groans under a load of words, and sweats with cumbersome metaphors.
Sir Clement Flint is a very*unpalatab!e character— a misanthrope without humour ; a kind of character well suited to a novel, but ill adapted to the stage. Clifford is a Sir Charles Grandisou, and as dull as can be ; Gayoillc is the hereditary Lover of the theatre ; and I.adn Emily a Miss Byron.
The Blandishes are happy sketches, and original, -j If any thing could have given popularity to this play, it must have beep the performance. Pope was admirably emphatic and easy in Clifford; B arrymore did justice amply to Gayoilte; andSoETT’s Alscriy was a rich performance; Miss Duncan’s Lady Entity was elegant and good ; Miss DeCamp’s Miss A her ip and Mrs. Mountain’s Miss Alton .fr. e in the first style of excellence.	1

Tuesday 12, o’Clock.
Sir,
I am extremly concerned that it was not in my power to give you earlier Intelligence than the enclosed addressed to you by Dr. Pearson now conveys. I did not conceive yesterday that my Son’s Indisposition would have prevented his Appearance this Evening, or my regard for the Interest of the Theatre and my respect for the Public who patronize him with such unparalelled generosity, would have caused me instantly to have apprised you of it. Ill as he his, he is even now desirous to play rather than be thought deficient in either of these Respects ; but I am confident that neither the Public nor the Proprietors would accept such a mark of his Zeal at the Risk stated by Dr. Pearson.
To R. WROUGHTON, Esq.
I am Sir, T our obedient Servant,
W. HENRY BETTY. * I
Sir,
Tuesday half past Eleven.
‘ On being called in to Master BETTY, Yesterday, I did not consider his Indisposition of such a nature as to justify my interference with his earnest desire not to disappoint the Public, by changing the performance advertised for this Evening. But this Morning, I am decidedly of opinion, that he cannot without the greatest hazard attempt to appear on the Stage this Evening.
I am, Sir, Yours &c.	~

DRUR.Y-LA.KE.
Last night the Young Roscius appeared in the character ot' Tattered, in the tragedy c-f Tancrcd and SigRmttmia,—He is likely to restore to the stage a play which has long been put upon the shelf, and indeed not without reason.—The flowery and descriptive poetry of Thompson can never produce much dramatic effect, and a tragedy without incidents and surprises must never hope to be Ion°- oo-pular.	?<-d- S~
Tattered has not much character, though he his a great deal to say for himself, and is constantly on the stage; be has impetuosity, fire, and feeling, but they evaporate in tedious speeches, and he is never placed in those striking situations which fix the interest and fextort the plaudits of an audience, much more than the nao:-t delicate flowers of eloquence and poetry.
Master Ctr rv acquitted himself in this character much better than in Romeo, though it is greatlv inferior to his Douglas and Achmet.—»In the scenes of passion, in any passion but luce, he attained to all that excellence which his youth and inexperience entitle us to expect, and vvheie he fell short the fault was not in his judgment. Sometimes the poetry would not bear out his feelings, and sometimes his feelings were not equal to the expressions of the poet ; he was sometimes above him, and sometimes BeWw him •' but certainly, if he did not soar to any unexpected and unusual excellence, he never sunk inter monotony and insipid ty.—We ■ have so long settled in our minds the merits of this extraordinary boy, that it is useless to dilate upon a performance which, if it did hot swell the list, assuredly did not detract from it.
yTiie part of Osmoi. 1 ws* n~t equal to {he powers of Elusion ; but his performance wasjudiciousand impressive.—Mrs. H. Johnston appeared, for the first time, in Stutsmunda, and performed with a great deal of feeling and taste.—The house overflowed.

deed there is none, for the adequate representation o( which she possesses such an ample share of the requisite qualities? , Foe Kir person, manner, and voice, have ever}- thing in them that is happily expressive ot gentleness^deiicacy, and tenderness. She was greeted throughout with,.-chat marked and seasonable applause, which is the genuine refleilion of the emotions whieK-her performance was calculated to excite. Very different was the impression which Mr. Elmston’s Rmtn seemed to make upon the au. diénce. They had almost every where to regret the absence of that tenderness sf tone, of that sua. vity of manners, of that flexibility of deportment, which should charafleristically exhibit the soft solicitudes of the plaintive anxious lover, and were rather repulsed than interested, by his studied attitudes, his abrupt transitions, and boisterous bursts of passion. Bannister’s Mercutio was as full of whim as ever ; and upon the whole, the performance went off with unmixed approbation.
Mr. Et.ListoN was happier in M-alrimmy. where he was so ably assisted by the irresis'ible fascinations. of Mrs. Jordan’s ailing in Clara. They had every thing to stimulate their exertions that could be administered by a full and flattering house.
