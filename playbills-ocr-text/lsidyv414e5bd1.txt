''SCHEMING MAB."

The author had often thought, that to the variety of character which had been dramatized, might be added one
1,1
"nimmagem: having witnessed, amongst the Lads of the SHAP, as marked n peculiarity of character, eomposed of
• "mand humour, as is to lie found in either Yorkshiremen, Irishmen, or the Cockney.
The experiment was tried, with considerable success, at the Olympic and other Theatres, in the above Faroe el
iteming Mad," in the scheming-mad year 1825. The BRUMMAGEM MOS was so funny ; the schemcrso rediculous; th«
rwwfldj and the lathes so bewitching ; that they beg leave to be seen in " A VIs'lT TO BIRMINGHAM,' when

__E_>_fW A V

BIRMINGHAM.
At the especial instance of the Friends and Visitors of the Theatre, and in justice to
the Management, the following Notice is submitted to the Public.
rAe Managers of the Th'.atre Royal deeply regret to have to announce that, owing to a severe and unexpected Ilints t,
Mademoiselle TAG'LION7 is unable to fulfil the Engagement which she had entered into, for appearing on this present Monday
Evening, and on Wednesday tfexl.
The Managers feel it due to the Public as well as to themselves, in making; this announcement, to state that up to Saturday
afternoon, August 9th instant, they had the most confident reliance that Mademoiselle TAG LION I would be enabled to
fulfil her Engagement. In the course of that day they posted to London, when they found Mademoiselle T. confined to
her room, and suffering from severe indisposition. The Managers obtained a certificate at Madlle. Taglioni's residence,
No. Ho, Piccadilly, LondoH, from her Medical Attendants, and that Lady kindly addressed the following Letter to
the Managers.
Messieurs les Directeurs du Theatre Royal de Birmingham.
LONDRES, 10 AOUT, 1834.

Je ne vetts pas vous laisser repartir, sans vous exprimer de nouveau* combien je suis malheureuse de ne pouvoir realiser
mon projet de voyage a Birmingham Ce que vous m'ecriviez, dans votre derniere lettre, de I'empressement que le public
avait mis a vouloir asMster a mes representations, etait si flaneur pour moi, qu'il faut bien qtt'il y ait imposslbilite absolue.
Je suis biln aise, d'ailleurs, que vous ayiez pris la peine de veuir a Londres, car vous avez pu voir dans quel etat de faiblessc
j'etais, et je cnmpte sur votre obligeance pour m'excuser aupres du public, et lui temoigner toute ma reconnaissance. Ainst
que je vous 1'ai dit de vive voix loiit-a-l'lieure, j e prends ici ('engagement de donner a Birmingham, a mon premier voyage
en Angletarre, les representations que ma maladie m'a empeche de donner cette annee. Recevez, Messieurs, de nouveau,
tous mes regrets, et 1'assurance de nies sentiments les plus distingues.

MARIE TAGLIONI.
P. S. J'ai appris touf-a-l'beure que vous aviez engage MADEMOISELLE O'BBYAN, et je ne saurais trop vous la
recommander. J'ai souvent danse avec elle, et elle ne peut etre que fort agreable au public.

A M. M. Wightman et Fitzgibbon,

MARIE TAGLIONI.

TRANSLATION.
7'. the Managers of the Theatre Royal, Birmingham.
London, \0th August, 1834.
I cannot permit you to leave London without again expressing to you how unfortunate 1 am at not being able to realise
my project of a journey to Birmingham. What you wrote to me in your'last letter about the impatience of the Public to wiu
ness my performances, was so flattering,tltat nothing short of an absolute impossibility could have prevented it. 1 am very glad M
other respects, that you have taken the trouble to come to London, for you have been enabled to see in what a state of weakness.
I am, and I depend on your kindness to make my excuse to the Public, and testify to them my sense of their favour. As I
have just assured you by word of mouth, I here engage on my first journey in England, to perform before the Public of Birmingham, which my illness has alone prevented me from doing this year. Accept, once more, Gentlemen, my regrets, and the
sentiments of the sincere esteem of

MARIE TAG LI ONI.
P.S. I have just learned that you have engaged Mademoiselle O'Bryan, and I cannot too much recommend her. I have
often danced with her, and she cannot fail to delight the Public.

To Messrs. Wightman and Fisgtbbon.

MARIE TAOLIONI.

CERTIFICATE.
WE, undersigned, certify that MADEMOISELLE TAGLIONI having been labouring since Sunday last under a vary
severe illness, is yet so weak as to prevent her from appearing in public for some time, without the most dangerous consequences.

A. SCANNIER, 66, Frith-street.
V, DELISII, 168, Regent-street.

10th August, 18*4.
N.B. We have just seen MADEMOISELLE TAGLIONI, in the presence of Messrs. Fitzgibbon and Wightman,
Managers of the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, at 115, Piccadilly, London.
Under these circumstances, the Managers deem it right to adopt the course recommended by Mademoiselle TAGLIONI,
and have engaged the celebrated DANCER,

Mademoiselle 0' Bryan
at a very heavy expense, who, in conjunction with

MADAME GIUBILEI,
MONSIEUR S I L V A I N
and

Principal Dancers at the Italian Opera House,
Arriped from London this Morning,
in company wit. the Managers of the Theatre, and will appear together this evening in the Dances already announced.
The Managers having ase_ their most zealous and indefatigable exertions to fulfil their pledge to the public, submit
the jerere Josses they are liable to sustain to the consideration of the supporters of the Theatre, and beg to state, that the*
cnttftam the most perfect confidence that the celebrated Dancers already announced will meet the wishes of a liberal public.

In consequence of the complaints respecting the extreme Cold experienced by the
Patrons of the Theatre Royal, immediate arrangements were made with the proper
authorities to obviate the same, and the Lessee has now the honor to announce to the
Public, that a New and Improved WARMING APPARATUS has been erected by
Mr. Hawkes, which not only raises the Theatre to a Comfortable Temperature, but as
the warm air is conveyed into the Box & Pit Lobbies, the great inconvenience so long felt
of the rush of cold air into the Boxes, when the doors were opened, is now prevented.

(UNDER THU SOLE MANAGEMENT OP MR F1TZGIBBON.)

The Lessee has the honor most respectfully to announce to the Public generally, that
in consequence of Mr. Benson having unaccountably and most dishonourably withdrawn his services from the Theatre, without any notice to the management, the new
Opera of Fra Diavolo, in which that Gentleman was engaged to sustain an important
character, is of necessity deferred till WEDNESDAY next, when it will positively be
produced, the Lessee having succeeded in procuring the services of Mr. HUTCHINS
and Miss STB ART, from the Theatres Royal, Bath and Bristol, to aid the talent of
MR. and MRS. WOOD, and MR. HQRNCASTLE, in that Opera.

Its drawbridge and portcullis weight,
Stone, bar, moat, bridge, or barrier left.;
N o r of its fields a blade of grass,
Save what g r o w s on a ridge of wall
W h e r e stood the hearthstone of the Hall.
1 saw its turrets in a blaze,
T h e i r crackling battlement* all cleft,
A n d tiieiiQt.J.eadjpour down like rain

From off'the scorch'd and blaeken'd roof,
Whose thickness was not vengeance proof.
They little t h o u g h t that d a y of pain,
When launch'd as on the lightning's flash
They bade me to destruction dash,
That one day I should come again.
With twice five thousand horse, to thank
The Count for his uncourteoua ride.

In order to meetthe exigencies and circumstances of the generality of that portioRi of the Public, who are the recognised supporters
of the Theatre Royal, the Lessee, with the most liberal consideration,
has maturely deli berated upon the main and paramount object of securing to his patrons, t?co of the greatest objects which he presumes
can be desired by the Lovers of the Drama:—
F I R S T — T h e constant succession of the most Talented Persons in
the Theatrical Profession, in addition to one of the best and most
numerousCompany's at this moment on theBritish Stage, which,without exception, establishes the Birmingham Theatre Royal upon the
highest scale of provincial pre-eminence, with the acknowledged
magnitude of the Largest and most Splendidly Decorated Theatres
in the Kingdom.
The second great object, he trusts, cannot fail to meet the unanimous support of the Public at large, namely:—A G E N E R A L
R E D U C T I O N of P R I C E S to EVERY P A R T of the HOUSE,
at 9 o'clock precisely, without the slightest diminution ofany portion
of that talent, which the Lessee has duly considered indispensible
for the character and credit of the Theatre, and without which, the
support of the Public could not finally be calculated upon.
Having thus submitted to the Public generally the two most material points so universally sought for—the production of the first
Talent in the country, upon the lowest possible scale of Admission.
The Lessee pledges himself, that NO VARIATION, or advance whatever, on the reduced Prices of the Theatre, shall be made provided the experiment should prove, at the
termination of ONE FORTNIGHT sufficient to compensate him for the current expenses,
which, the Public must be aware, are of such considerable magnitude that unless the r e
duction of the prices of admission will counterbalance his expenses, he must, at the expiration of that period, be compelled again to submit to the Public, the necessity of placing1
the Prices upon the former Seale,

largest and most splendidly decorated Theatres in the kingdom.
The second great obpet, he trtwts, cannot fail to meet the unanimous support of the Public at large, namely:—

A General Reduction of Prices to every part of the House, at $ o'clock, without the lightest
iliminution of any portion of that Talent, which the Lessee has duly con ndered iiidispensible for the character and credit

ADDRESS TO T H E PUBLIC.
The Public in general are moat respectfully informed, that as manv malicious and designing efforts have boe*n (tori isrd, by means of shameful anil iafamous repot Is, as well as certain Libellous Publications and Play Bills, industriously
V'omnlgated, in order to prejudice the public minds against the character and respectability of my situation as Lessee if
I Theatre Royal, and, in order to follow up the cruel and wanton injuries, by which I have already sustained severe
i is»j through the base and cowardly attacks of a party, who heretofore have never been identified with any other class than

But, with that generosity so characteristic with Mr. Kean's uniform-conduct, that gentleman has liberally offered
tho aid of his valuable services GRATUITIOUSLY, in his favorite and celebrated character of R I C H A R D t h e
• V 5 I I R D . Under the foregoing circumstances, I respectfully entreat the Public will suspend their judgment relative
I i the attacks made against the Theatre, pending the issue of legal proceedings, which 1 have already instituted against
the parties.

NOTICE.
It having- toecn Tcry generally circulated, iliat Mr. Fitzglbhoii is still connected

with the management of the T h e a t r e Royal, Mr. A rmistead, the present Manager,
deems It his imperative duty to inform t h e Public, that Mr. Filzglbbon is not in any
way, directly or indirectly, connected with the Management or the Theatre Royal,
Birmingham.
Mr. A R M I S T E A D , anxious to contribute to the gratification of his Friends and Patrons in Birmingham, respectfully announces he has made arrangemeiHs

MR. U S H E R ,
From the Theatre Royal, D r u r y Lane,

*

It may he useless to comment on the Eccentricities and Whimsicalities of Mr. Usher's Comic Talent, as he n o doubt still remains in the recollection
. f t h . s e who visited the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; Olympic Circus, Liverpool; and the Theatre Royal, Manchester, when his exertions were nightly
honoured with high acclamations of applause; he has latterly appeared in Dublin, Newcastle, Glasgow, &.c. with equal success. W e copy the following from
she Glasgow Free Press:—
"Scarcely any one in the United Kingdom is ignorant of the famous USHER, Clown of the London and Liverpool Theatres; he has kept half the
population of the Empire in a slate of Laughter for the last quarter of a Century; and has produced many varieties hi his line of n very striking natare,
such as sailing on the River T h a m e . mid Kher Liffcy near Dublin, in a washing tub, drawn by four Geese, and afterwards dashing along the High-road from
the Fridge to the Theatre, driving his four real Cats in hand, yoked to a small Curricle. Though this is not of the Shakspeare or Kemble School, yet it is
vev\ new, never accomplished by any one but himself, and U S H E R E D in a race of actors never contemplated by Quin, Garriek, or any other manager of
billed performers.

thev conveyed
_____

SO Barrels* Gunpowder

to the destined Bpot, and covered the whole with coals and faggots, brongbt for the express purpose. The day for the silting of Parliament BOW approached.
Never was treason more secret, or ruin more apparently inevitable; the hour was expected with impatience—the conspirators gloried in their meditate!
guilt; and when all the motives of pity, justice, and safety were too weak, a rtnioree of private friendship saved the kingdom. One of the conspirators
lonceived a design of saving the life of Lord Monteagle, his ancient friend and [companion. This nobleman upon his return to town, received a letter
from a person unknown, and delivered by one who fled as soon as he had discharged his message —The contents of this mysterious letter surprised and
perplexed the nobleman to whom il was addressed, particularly the following lines:—"For iho' there be no appearance of any stir, vet I sail they will
recess, a ternble blow this Parliament, and yet they shall not see who hurts them:—-the danger is past as soon as you have binned this letter"
Concluding
tt,ut some sudden peril »as preparing by gunpowder, he thought it adviseable to inspect the vaults below the House of Parliament, when, remarking the
piles of faggots heaped on every sid«, he seized a man preparing for the terrible enterprise, dressed in a cloak and boots, and a dark lantern in his hand.
T his mau was no other than Guy Fawkes, who bad just disposed every part O F H I S T R A I N lor its taking fire immediately ; he was seized, and the whole
design was instantly discovered
The other conspirators, fortifying the house to which they had flown (or refuge, resolved to sell their lives as dearly as
possible, when a spark ef tiro happening to fall among some gunpowder that was laid to dry, it blew op, and thus, by the will of Divine Providence, most
justly accomplished their own destruction. In the present Drama, the above circumstances, with many other striking and affecting situations, are intro.
duted with the strictest adherence to historical truth, so as on the whole to form it one of the most interesting, at the same time most awful, exhibitions
ever produced on any siege.

THE CELEBRATED GUNPOWDER TREASON !

W a s plotted at t h e beginning of the reign of James I. A more horrid or more terrible scheme never entered into the human heart t o conceive. The
diabolical plan w a s first broached by Robert Catesby, w h o conceived that a train of gunpowder might be so placed under the Parliament House, as to blow
«p the King and all the members at once; how horrid soever the contrivance might appear, yet every conspirator seemed faithful and secret in Ihe league;

t o the. destined spot, and covered the whole with coals a n d faggots, brought for the express purpose T h e day for the sitting of Parliament now approached.
Never was treason more secret, or ruin more apparently inevitable ; the hour was expected with impatience—the conspirators gloried in their meditated.
g u i l t ; a n d when all the motives of pity, justice, and safety were too weak, a remorse of private friendship saved the kingdom. One ot the conspirators*
conceived a design of saving the life of Lord Morteagle, his ancient friend and ^companion. This nobleman upon his return to town, received a letter
trom a person unknown, a n d delivered by one who fled as soon as he had discharged his m e s s a g e — T h e contents of this mysterious letter surprised and
perplexed the nobleman t o whom it was addressed, particularly t h e following lines:—"For iho'there be no appearance of any stir, yet I say they wilt
receive a terrible blow this Parliament, and yet they shall not see toho hurts them:—the danger is past as soon as you hare burned this tetter."
Concluding
that some sudden peril was prepaiing by gunpowder, h e thought it adviseable to inspect the vaults below the House of Parliament, when, remarking t h e
piles of faggots heaped o n every side, he seized a man preparing for the terrible enterprise, dressed in a cloak a n d boots, and a dark lantern in his hand.T
Ehis m a n was n o other than Guy Fawkes, who h a d just disposed every part O F H I S T R A I N lor its taking fire immediately ; h e was seized, and t h e whole
design was instantly discovered
T h e other conspirators, fortifying the house to which they h a d flown for refuge, resolved to sell t h e i r lives as dearly asu
possible, when a spark of fire happening to fall among' some gunpowder that was laid to dry, i t blew u p , and thus, by the will of Divine Providence, most
juslly accomplished their own destruction. I n the present Drama, the above circumstances, with many othei striking and affecting situations, are intro%?Uced with the strictest adherence to historical truth, s o as on t h e whole to form it one of t h e most interesting, at the same time most awful, exhibitions
fver produced o n any stage.
