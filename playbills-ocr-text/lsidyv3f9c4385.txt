DRURY-LANE THEATRE, Sep. iS.
The Play of Deaf and Dumb ; or, The Orphan pnotefted, performed at Drury-Lane on Thurfday evening, has been fo often rcprefentcd with merited applaufe, and the piece and performers therein having fo recently pafled the ordeal of criticifm, there remains little now for obfervation; a particular remark, if it have not been already made, may not be unworthy attention:—Allowing the deaf and dumb boy to poifefs, in ever fo high a degree, intuitive faculties, and the required hab:t of tranilating (if it may be fo termed) sign’s into writing, it can fcarcely be thought poifible that he ihould, from De L’Epee’s addon, underftaod the queflion fo very exactly as to produce on paper the identical words, " Who, in your opinion, is the grcateft genius that France has ever produced ?” efpecially as there is in the queftion a fuperfluous word, a mere expletive ever, which does not, in the fmallelt degree, augment the fenfe of “ the greatefl genius that France has produced.” The writing might have been expreffed in the.following or fome other varied words :	“ Who do you coniiier as the brighteft
genius Frince has given birth to ?”
This would have fufficiently illuftrated the boy’s intelligent mind, and favoured more of probability. In the character of De L’F.pee, " If the hufbandman experiences,” &c. ihould be, If the hufb mdman experience.	-	•
Mr. Powell, who performed, for'the firit rime, Mr. Bannifler’s part of Dupre, was energetic and impreffive; one falfe emphafis occurred, —" My fins are not to be penfioned,” initead of “ My fins are not to be pensioned;” and the name Julio founded, in his utterance, like Julia. Thefe are, however, " trifles light as air,” proceeding, probably, from the cuftomary want of felf-pofleflion, which a new character produces in almoft every performer. The liveried fervants reminded one of the Blue-flocking Club ; and, if Dupre had had tellovr fervants attired like himfelf, it would have recalled to memory "many a devil in flame-coloured ftockings.”
The Mask of Comus was the After-piece of this, evening. The mutilated, mangled condition, in which Milton’s noble poem is now pre-fented, precludes any other obfervation on it, than that,jis it occupies the portion of time at the Theatre, ufually allotted to Farce, it is, in its prefent ftate, a mere farce.
^ very hanci/ome apology having been made in the Porcup ike of Fr clay, for the tniflake refperHng Mr. Murray and Mr. Pope, the obf rvations on that initlake would hive hero fupprefled, but that it was thought they would lerve as a caut on to other weters of theatrical sriticifm, “ to hear ¡ind fee the matter” before they ventured to •ondenrn.

. COVENT GARDEN THEATRE, Sep. is.
I	\	• V.	.
The writer of this went yefterday evening to fee The School for. Prejudice, without the fmalleit tincture of that quality ; having never before feen, or read the piece. It is but juftice to fay that there are many humourous expreffions and lituations in it, but it wants the fta-mina of legitimate comedy; the boll of the tree is but llender, the branches are w'eak, and, amidit a luxuriant foliage, but little fruit: it however, is pleafingly umbrageous, though not highly profitable. To quit figure for fact; the only particular obfervation that occurred was the overfight in Frank Liberal and Mildmay both appearing at once, if the bull may be pardoned, in the fame coat, in the laft feene.
The play is well a<iled throughout; but the predominant excellence of the performance refts w ith the Jew and Yorkfhireman mofr admirably depidted by Meffrs. Fawcett and Emery. In the After-piece of St. David’s Day are two good feenes, for which we are indebted to the painter, not the poet; the opening feene, w'ith a Bridge in it, and. a landfcape, in the fecond adt.
SADLER’S WELLS,	*
* ' - ' “• Much novelty has been produced here this feafon, under the direction of Mr. C. Dibdin, Junr. fbrother to Mr. T. Dibdin of Covent Garden Theatre) Stage Manager and Author ol the Pieces, whofe productions have been, Burlettas and Burletta Spectacles:—> Claudine ; Nelffln’s Vidtory ; Egyptian Laurels ; Paddington Canal, &e. Ballet Pantomimes:—Ethiop and Great Devil; Harlequinades ; Alchymist, and Harlequin Benedick. Gowriet the Ballet Mailer, has alfo produced eight or ten new Dances, and fome of the beft Performances of lail year have been revived with particular applaufe. The feenery has in general done Mr. Andrews the artiil, great credit, particularly a Panoramic View of a plan presented to the Houfe of
Commons by---------Dance, Efq. the City Surveyor, for re-building
London Bridge.
The Public have acknowledged the merit of the feveral productions by a frequent and flattering attendance, and the feafou has proved pretty profitable to the Proprietors, w'ho have certainly difplayed no inconfiderable degree of fpirit.
To C?0*RE sVohdenti.—We are under the unavoidable neceffty of poftponirg a fecond entique on the Drama of Dsaf and Dumb, with which we have been favoured by a correfpondent; but, as it is too pointedly jult to be with-held from the public, it will form a part of the next week’s number,

ON FRIDAY A NEW GRAND SELECTION.
'
Of the iMprulruitf uf Theatrical.
. Scenery- 'u (• J,
TH AT the public mind rnay not be led rtvvjy by mifreprefematiou, in ®ur daily prima, of the building erected on the fegc at l)rurv-lpne theatre for the performances of Oratorios in the lad wcelf but one in Lent; I think a fetv hints on this head may be necel-farv, to do away the effeél of fuch im-preinrtms as tending to millead their tafte, and their knowledge of Antiquities in this country.
Managers announce this building as executed in“ the Gothic flyle j” meaning thereby the fiyle of orjr anfient architettare; a vulgar and opprobriousepi-thet, firft made ufe of in the 17lh centu-re', to call a ftigma on the noble fcicnoe. Mex’t, they, or the newljtapt rs for them, tell us, “ The defign git es the Interior of an abhev,” (knowing net difference between the church itlelf, and the dq-meliic dwellings and offices conftttu-ting fuch an infiirutioii). “ The or-clieilra was placed in a cathedral with every appropriate decornino not ferupling to talk about thè drelies of the choir, as confident with inch a religious leene ; and many otner notices of the' like import.
Well, thus it was. t found that painting dope for the Weliètn part of the chape! introduced in lie Moutfort, two years ago, and lafi year brought out again as a ita'l in Adelutorn, cut tip inro parcels, Iti fhew an interior after the antienl manner. It could not be a church ; for the diftaucc had uet-thvr a ’.Veil door and window, nor an
Haflcm-window, altar, &c. It could not be a chamber ; for it had on ettber fide an aile of two divihons, with groined cielings, parts appertaining to churches only. It could not be a hall ; for ailes and groins hare no refereneé to fuch a (ituation, where alone are to be found walls fupporting otten timber worked roofs, as in Weiliuiniler-hall, &c. The organ svas of the modern make; the rotai arms from a call at Coade's manufactory ; the pipare fremè ot Handel in the common way; the multe defies not unlike the Prince of Wales's craft, three chandeliers in the ufuat pa-rilh-cburch order; and the drefllc of the harmonic tribe, fuch as any of us wear in the ordinary occurrences of life ; the architecture of the main edifice of Henry VIhh’s time; and the fences before tile lingers and muficians in the inode of Edward Illd's day.
According te this my fiaiement, from what Ctuation are we to confidar the immortal Handel's drains iffued to entrance the lifteaing foul ? Here my experience in the arrangement of an-tient buildings will m no way come to aid me to decide in this conflict of managerial impropriety, fet againft precept or example.
It would be injufitce to the aitili concerned in painting the columns, arches, pannels, windows, groins, See. not to (ay they are laboured and exact copies from parts of Wefiiinnfter-abbey’, and remnantantientedificesabonttowit. Thus much for this fcenic fpe&acle ! An Artist ano an Antiquart.
