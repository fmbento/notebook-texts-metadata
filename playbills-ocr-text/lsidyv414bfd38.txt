The V AM PYRES are supposed to be Evil

Spirits, permitted to roam about the Earth

powers of Fascination, so long as they sacrifice yearly, before the getting of the Last
Moon in every year, a young Female, whom they must previously Marry, and # h o i #
blood is necessary to support their existence.

The Moon is supposed to possess strange

Creatures, if slain by a mortal hand, and their

Their fatal Charter however

is utterly lost, if through any delay the appointed Moon sinks into the Ocean before

powers of Faicinatidn, so long as they sacrifice yearly, before the setting of the Last
Moon in every year, a young Female, whom they must previously Marry, and whose
blood is necessary to suppc* t their existence.

The Moon is supposed to possess strange

Creatures, if slain by a mortal hand, and their

corpses iue so placed as to catch the First beams of the Moon, when it rises they become
