favoured with that general fostering aid, which has so peculiarly marked the estabb
lneiit of the Norwich, Bath, and Liverpool Theatrical Funds, and which is so essej
tially necessary for its permanency and efficacy. This must originate in the w» n ' .
skill, on the part of those most deeply interested in its welfare; and, whilst Mr. M A N ^ ,
claims the principal share in the censure, he, at the same time, calls upon the f ' ° e r J
and the generous, to second his efforts, in eudeavouring to render the Fund pern"*..'
and beneficial.
The intention of it is, to give bread to those who can no longer earn it—toadm1"'
ter support to age—cordial to sickness—and relief to penury.—So forcibly has •
necessity of such a source been felt in London, that there is an Annual Public D' nD 01
for each of the Funds of Drury-Lane and Covent Garden, at which is collected ft".
Twelve to Fifteen Hundred Pounds.—The York Theatrical Fund has been establi'-1 f
for Six Years, and it has not the good fortune to be worth Six Hundred Pounds, &? (
than half of which has been contributed by Subscriptions from the Performers. I 0 <j
Year, from the present date, Claimants -ill have the privilege of calling upon tl.er B °
for support—there is every probability of three.—Should that be the case, they *J
only be relieved to the amount of perhaps Six, or, at the very uttermost. Eight Po uB
per Annum,
Now. Mr. M. feels conviction, that the aid afforded in London, does not ProC^t
horn there being B greater proportion of philanthropy and benevolence in the Metrop 0 " *
than is to be found in this affluent and charitable County, but from the want of a-* (
cates. TO give it 30ine trifling help, the Manager has appointed FRIDAY, Decei~°f
the 7th, for THE BENEFIT OK THE THEATRICAL F U N D , when will be P*!'
sented the Tragedy of PIZARRO, and the Musical Farce of the TURNPIKE GAT*'
