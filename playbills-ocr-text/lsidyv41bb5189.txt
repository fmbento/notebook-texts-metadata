THEATRE KOYAL, April j i , 178.;

To

the

. P U B L I C .

H E Applaufe granted U& Year to the THEATRICAL FETE, compiled by Mr. WILKINSON, has encouraged him
to attempt this Seafon a Night's Entertainment of the fame Kind. A Peiformance on a limilar Plan, but compufed of
afferent Material,, w ,s offered at L O N D O N laft Summer by Mr. C O L M A N , and at D U B L I N this Winter, and attended
«ith Succcf- at each Theatre. The Pieces from which th.-fe Fetes were formed, were the beft Stock Plays, fitch as Hamlet,
Othdh, Henry Fill. Romeo, itc. The Public m ,y poflibly recollect, when Mr. WILKINSON had'firft the Honour of
pieftnting to them this Species of Entertainment, he particularly objected to the mangling thofe Performmances which were in
PolTclfion of the Stage; and he begs Leave to fay,- he ftill remains of the fame Opinion. He thinks it contrary to all Order
and Connection—deftn.ctive of all Plot and Defign—injurious to Merit—inimical to the &age—and (he had almoit faid) faciilegioi's to SHAKSPEARE ! He cannot inftance this better than by mentioning the Close; Scene in Hamlet. It is douUlefs
an excellent Performance ; but were it read or played feparaiely from the preceding Part of the Tragedy, we fhould not
nlv be deprived of fome of the tineft Thoughts in the Englifh Language, but we fbould likewife be at a Lofs to ac,nt for his Behaviour to his Mother, and call that Conduct B R U T A L , which, in Reality, is J U S T I F I A B L E and P R A I S E VORTHY. In fhort, the Mode here cenfured tends to the Annihilation, rather than t6 the fctcovery, of Dramatic Beauties.
Mr, WILKINSON'S Plan was, and is, to reftore to the Public, Scenes of infinite Merit from Pieces obfolete, or at Jeaft little
known. In doing this, he hopes he is not only prefenting a notivelle and pleating Spectacle to the Audience, but alfo ferving
the Caufe of Literature, by preferving Sterling Ore, which might otherwife have been lofl: In each of his Fetet he has endeavoured to give as much V A R I E I V as poflible, and that which he noW offers he trufts Will difplay Beautiful Oratory in
Point of Language—Morality—Boldnefs—WhimficalitV—and Pathos. He has only to add, that In the Execution of this Deiign every Exertion fhall be ufed, and no Expence withheld, to fecure a kind Countenance and Protection from the Candour of
the Public.

THE Public is respectfully informed, that the extraordinary success of the Splendid New Comic Pantomrne has
been so unpafalled, that the management thinks itself imperatively obliged to comply with the public wish, so

Now acting with the most enthusiastic approbation in London to crowded and admiring audiences.
An evening London paper speaking of this piece, says, " We last night witnessed a production, Ai very name of which is sufficient to
ensure its success, REFORM, or, JOHN BULL T R I U M P H A N T ; the piece is in itself of a pleasing naturs, but the popularity of the
subject enhanced its value ten-fold—every line in allusion to the present state of political affairs, was received with loud demonstrations of applause—the house was crowded to the ceiling, and if we may judge of its favourable and enthusiastic reception last night, we prognosticate it
will have as great a run as the BEGGAR'S OPERA, when it was first produced, we strongly recommend all country managers to avail
themselves of the advantage of producing it immediately, as well for their own sakes, as from the popularity of the subject with th. country at large

Or, T H E D E S E R T S OF S I B E R I A .

Tfci* interesting PUy is takep from Madame Cottin's celebrated French work, " Elizabeth, or the
Exile of .Siberia." Tke^story, aeptiniep.ts, and mp-U striking situations, are cjosely copied from the
original, which has been universally read and admired through Europe, and translated into almost every
modern language. Were the narrative merely the creatfcm df fancy, it would be considered as affecting
a fictianr#.*,?yfcF¥]et tlS.J'pu.jJLc eye; but as it ts generally known ;to be foupded on truth, and to be
actually^tft ^.itabl.ittedfi»jet, tenfold sympathy is njtnfally excited by i t s dramatic representation. The
Heroine of thi« pipee was a character that really existed in our own tunes; ,who undertook a dangerous
and painful journey of several thousand miles, over trackless snows and inhospitable, deserts, to throw
herself at the feet of her sovereign at bis coronation, and implore pardon for an honourable, but exiled
father. Thtf-EffipCToT "Msx^ncTeT, wtlbseTPagnanimity has since been the theme of every tongue, even
then gave a happy and glorious presage of: his.fchai'.idter' and reign, bjl generously granting a parent's
freedom to the ardent supplications of his duteous child, thus rewarding filial piety, apd exerting the best
prerogative of royalty,— the power of pardon. This transaction, ;,so honourable to that monarch,
from motive? of stage effect and propriety, is fixed lit a reipote period of history. Factfi are improved
by the most'impressivalTctio'ris. The heroic character of Daran, the unwearied champion and protector
of oppressed innocence, heightens the Serious interest of the piece,, while t h e pathetic.is admirably
blended with the comic, a n d the most animated and choice music sheds brilliance over the ^vhole of this
varied arid entertaining Drama.

GOLDEN FARMER
This Diana is founded on an incident in the life of an individual denominated the Golden Farmer, a notorious highwayman, who under the
guise of a Cornchandler dwelling in Thames-street, whilst exhibiting his packets of barley and oats by day, made himself acquainted with the
contents of the Farmers' pockets, if which he despoiled them by night. By these dishonest means he acquired a considerable sum, purchased a
Farm, obtained the title of the ..OLDEN FARMER, and endeavoured by sincere repentance and a reformed life, to make some atonement
for his former misdeeds.

FATE OF OALAS;

40 years, when his son Antoine, fell into the hands of designing persons, who stript him of several large sums of
money at play: he became also fatally attached to a young woman, whose friends forbad the union, unless he abjured
his religion. These circumstances rendered him gloomy and reserved, and he became his S e l f - H e s t r o y e r * His
death was no sooner made public, than a cry was made by the Fanatics of that day, that it was a principle of religion
among Protestants, that a F a t l i e r s h o u l d A s s a s s i n a t e h i s o w n S o n when he entertained any
thoughts of being converted ; monstrous as the doctrine was, it was received with an avidity indescribable.—Justice
became warped, and the unfortunate Calas was sentenced to be

Opinions of the Newspaper Press.
/From the Hull Rockingham, 25M February, 1843,J
."
- I t will be seen that Mr. Pritchard takes his benefit on Tuesday,
a n d that the season closes on Friday next, and we cannot refrain from
taking the opportunity of expressing the satisfaction we feel in learning that the season h a s been the most successful of any, for a long
series of years, on tbe Hull board.. Thin is the more gratifyiuir, when
t i e great depression in every department of trade is taken in account.
Much is owing—nay, the result is altogether owing—to the management of M r . Pritchard. H i s study has been t h e restoration of t h e
legitim ate drama. Great prejudice exists in m a n y really pious m i n d s
against stage representations, which the licentious exhibitions too
often produced h a r e n a t u r a l l y strengthened, and which the testimony
of snch men as Luther, who regarded the T h e a t r e a s the school of
human nature and the sustainer of morals, has not been able to remove. M r . Pritchard h a s given satisfactory evidence t h a t licentiousness is not a necessary accompaniment of the stage.
H e has succeeded in drawing together a very respectable company, and his industry and activity, a n d considerateness a s a m a n a g e r — t h e latter
quality is especially evinced in the cheerfulness with which he takes
subordinate p a r t . , in order to give his other actors full scope—ar.
worthy of all praise. T h e r e has been n o lack of variety and novelty,
and we are sure we pronounce the general opinion, when we say that
he has won the respect a n d the good wishes of all the play-going com-

munity. His next sojourn is a t York, a n d we hope that his success i>
that ancient »ity will.surpass what he has met with in H u l l . "
(From the Yorkshire Gazette, Saturday, March I I J
" T h e T h e a t r e Royal was opened for the season on Monday, u n .
der highly auspicious features. T h e lessee of the circuit and m a n a g e .
M r . P r i t c h a r d , appears to be a gentleman perfectly qceJified f or t i j
proper discharge of the duties which he has undertaken tcTperform.
During the past week, some excellent pieces have been brought for.
ward, and the performance of them reflects great credit upon M r .
Pritchard and his very excellent c o m p a n y , "

ijady Freelove, and M r . T . Holmes's Charles Oakley, were aluo
.reditable performances. T h e characters of Mr. and Mrs. Oak1*y were sustained by M r . Pritchard and Miss Waverley Scott.
Mr. P e s acting was a perfect portraiture of the affectionate
husb»nd, whose happiness is disturbed by jealous and unfounded
•armises, but who will not allow his feelings to prevent him from
performing his duty aa a m a n . Of Miss Waverley Scott it is
almost .operflueus to apeak. I n even' scene in which she appeared she rivetted the attention of the audience. H e r delineat i o n , of passion, prejudice, and suspicion, were faithful reflections of these too prevalent feelings, and were well calculated t .

OF AGE T0-M0M0W

This Farce was produced for the first lime at the Theatre-fio>al, Covent uarden, on the 1st 01 February, 1800. The till, if derived from the age of Frederick, the hero of the piece, who " just leaving his minority, proposes to submit to government" in l b .
•atrimoaial state, 1 he object of his affections is Sophia, ihe Niece of Lady Brumback, a ridiculous old woman of fortune, whose but!
L solicited by Baron Hiffleburg, an old fox-hunter; and the various stratagems by which Frederick endeavours to gain admission t .
Ml mistress, furnish the materials of the plot. The»e consist in the assumption of characters—first of a HAIR-DRESSER, and afterwards of a WOUNDED SOLDI till, and an OLD HOUSEKEEPER, in support of which he is aided by Maria, »n arch lively Walti.g Maid. They are attended by many truly ludicrous circumstances and situations ; the res.lt of which is a complete triumph .-.r
the sagacity of the old lady, and the union of Frederick and Soqhia.

To conclude with Buckston's Melo-drama of

LUKE,« LABOURER.
Or, T H E LOST SON.

This Drama, one of the most popular productions of the celebrated Buckstone, presents a Village Scene. The hei»
i* . rustic of strong mind, but stronger passions, who, but for untoward circumstances, might have been virtuous • but
wtoo. forced from the right path by the rigour of his fate, becomes, idle, hopeless, and depraved. The vices of the lower
aiders of society, for the most part, have their origiu in drunkenness ; and the eirors of Luke are to be traced to thi.
common source of sickness, poverty and crime ; for, though not an habitual drunkard, he was, by his own confessiou
as occasional tippler; and this character being incautiously—perhaps harshly—fixed on him by his master, he become,
idle, for uobody will employ him ; aud, as evil habits takes still deeper root in idleness, Luke the Labourer sinks into
Chat wret.hed class of beings which society rejects as a burden and a pest. The picture that he draws of his destitution
«nd the death of his wife—of his bitter agony and revenge, is truly heart-rending ; and, while it holds out a war.ing t«
(he peasant against the indulgence of criminal excess, it offers a lesson to prosperity not to trifle with the poor man'#
otaly hope and dependence—his character. We shall not anticipate the effects of a Drama which is pleasing and weft
written, conveying a line moral. Luke and the sailor are powerfully drawn, and there are many interesting situations

O P I N I O N S O F T H E PRESS.

(From the Yorkshire Gazette, March 23)
T H K T H K A T R K . — O n Tuesday last, WP were present
to witness the debut of Miss Matilda Ross, pupil of Jas.
iierie, Esq. (late acting manager of Covent (Jardeu
and Drury Lane Theatres.) Miss Ross performed the
p.ft of Lady Townley for the first time to a York an<ii.ace, and we may congratulate her upon a most favourable reoeption. We nuaj now congratulate Mr.
'Pritchard on the valuable additions he has made to his
company—this remark especially relerringto the ladies
It is a long time since we have witnessed so clever a
trio as Miss Waverley Scott, Miss Villars, and Miss
Ross, who are now talented, and will be greater, in
their several styles. Miss Villars possesses a fiue tone
for dramatic effect, which is pure and clear, her iutonars very musical and pleasing ; her figure is good,- and
sAe has a graceful style of acting far above the common order. The busy laughable iarce of the ' Rendezvous' followed, and the characters were extremley well
cast. Miss Waverley Scott, as Sophia, was inimitably
fine, and if the author bad been present he would have
been gratified, so natural was the personation of the
ifbildish romp, wlrch puts us forcibly in mind of the
late Mrs. Jordan. Mr. Davies also bids fair to become
a fiue actor in light comedy, and both he and Miss
Villars as Rose, whore valuable adjuncts to Miss Scott
who kept the house in a coutinued roar of laughter.
We hope Mr, Pritchard, with such a company, will
raise the dropping drama, which of late has, from one
cttuse or other, been so completely abridged of its utility that few, indeed, at this time are .sensible of its
monitory effects. Last night, being by desire of the
High Sheriffs Lady, Shakspere's comedy of " Much
ado about nothing," and the farce " ()f age to-morrow"
was performed to a very highly respectable audience.
The company exerted themselves to the utmost, and
were greeted with much applause. The characters
were extremely well dressed, especially in the play,

which puts one in mind of former times, when we had
the more frequent representations of Shakspere'g fin.
old plays, so true to nature and so full of genuine wortk
We would v.enture one general remark. There ar»
some actors who forget the author, but those who would
be truly great must have a kindred spirit with the poet,
and leel with him, and pourtray those passions he call.
forth with a faithful purity. It is not enough to hav»
a grammatical acquintance with him ; elocutory expression should ever be at command, to convey thus,
passions so constantly occuring from the text, that they
may precisely hit the sympathy of the auditors. It i*
not by degrees of loudness and softness that certain
passages are best marked, N o ; this has ruined t h .
prospects vjf many—the author's text has been destroy-ed, and the hour ranted out without one mark of sensibility or natural feeling, and it is ever thus when re»
presentation departs from uature, of which the actor
ought to be a faithful transcript. A musical intonatio.
is absolutely necessary to express the passions ; by it
the human sensibility and sympathy are awakened to
the highest degree ; and those who want this want the
greatest of all wants.
(From the Yorkshiremau, March 2 3 .
There has been no lack of novelty at our Theatr*
this week ; some of the fmest and most popular piece*
in the legitimate drama, have been produced, and sustained throughout their representation with an amount
of taste and talent rarely witnessed on the boards cf
the theatre of this city. Mr. Pritchard introduced t»
the public for the first time this week another candidate for public favour—we mean Miss Matilda Ross,,
a pupil of the celebrated James Serle, Esq., who is allowed, by common consent, to possess great talent ant?
excellent appreciation of character. The press upcoi
our space, however, by the assize intelligence, precludes us from entering upon a critical survey of th*
performances of the week.
