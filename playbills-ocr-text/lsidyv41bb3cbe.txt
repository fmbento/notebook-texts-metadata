This Play takes its rife from that memorable event the Battle of Crelfy, where thefe boafting Sons of France were

common Soldiers : After which the Victorious Monarch m^rch'd to Calais, then cail'd the Key of France, and after a Siege of 12 Months, (in which amazing proofs of valour were fhewn on both fides) iubdued and took this ftrong
Fortrefs, obliging them to lend 6 of their principal Citizens to lay the Keys of the City Gates at the Feet of the Kin^,

Very capital Judges of Theatrical Writings have pronounced this Play to be the b«ft Imitation of SHAKESPEAR ever

GEORGE

B vRNWELL.

It has been an invariable cnjlom for many Years with the London
Managers to perform this jujlly admired Play on mofl holidays,
in order that the youthful part of the Metropolis may benefit by the
excellent moral Uffons it contains. Few Parents or Ma/iers negleHpermitting their Children, Apprentices, and Servants, from
attending this Performance, which holds a Mirror that not only
points out how to avoid the path which leadi to nun but fhews the
way to virtue and profperity. In imitation of so high and praife.
worthy a precedent, we refpeBfully prefent it to the Town and
Neighbourhood of
Dray^n.
W e hope y o u r tafte is not so high to scorn;
A moral tale cfteem'd 'ere we were born;
W h i c h for a century of rolling years,
Has fill'd a thoufand. til >ufand eyes with tears.

BLACK BEARD.
The Piracies of CAPTAIN TEACH, whose depredations and cruelties on the high seas, particularly near the
shores of the Mediterranean, gamed him the surname of BLACK BEARD, are too well known to need comment. It is sufficient to say, that the present interesting spectacle is founded on the most prominent events
which closed his desperate career of Life, by his falling a victim to the British Bravery, and yielding up his
breath to the Commander of the PEARL FRIGATE, which had long been in search ot him ; His barbarous
Treatment of a young Algerine Prince and Princess, whora he had made his prisoners, to the latter of whom he
insolently offers love, the distress of his unhappy Wife, her Murder, her bleeding Apparition are all faithtul yet
horrible emblems of the deceitful allurements ol Vice, its unerring punishment, and the sure triumph of virtue!

A celebrated Tragedy, (not acted

Henry II;
OR, THE FALL OF FAIR ROSAMOND.
T H E story of Rosamond is one of the most remarkable and pathetic events in the records of our own country, and
the etfect this Tragedy has had in its representations plainly proves how admirably well calculated it is lor dramatic
purposes. Henry n . became enamoured of the beautiful Rosamond, daughter of the noble Clifford, and beinc frequently oblidged to leave his kingdom on account of the holy wars or crusades, at such times, to keep her safe jrora
the i ust resentment of his Queen Eleanor, he contrived a subterraneous labyrinth, which led by different windings
to the Bower of Woodstock, then the secret abode of his beloved fair. The avenue to this retreat could only be discovered by a clue of silk thread, which was deposited in a hollow tree at the entrance ot the labyrinth. I he repository of this clue was known to none but those who were in the immediate confidence of the King. The Abbot of
Glastenbury, a favourite of the Queen, as well as a confidant of the King, being offended, Irom polit.cal motives,
was determined to revenge himself on the King, by discovering to the Queen the amour ot Henry an<1 Rosamond,
and betray the secret with which he was entrusted; that done, the enraged Eleanor enters the labyrinth, ^n0 surprises the unsuspecting fair one in her retreat, and after upbraiding her with her love for Henry, is determined,
notwithstanding her entreaties, prayers, and supplications, to put an end to her rival's lite, which she effected by
obliging her to swallow poison, or die by the poignard, which she held to the tair one's bosom.

On Monday June 17th 1805, will be presented a Comedy, called
THE

Point oS Honour.
As performed in the Hay-Market Theatre, with the greatest success and approbation:—From a German Original,
and adapted to the English Stage, by C. Kemble.

The following sketch of the Story will clearly evince how very interesting and truly affecting
are the Incidents of this admirable Play.
A Soldier in the Service of France, having been provoked to strike an Officer, deserts from the regiment, he
is fortunate enough to procure employment in the House of a widow Lady. In consequence of an attachment to
her Daughter the Soldier is induced to discover to the Mother the predicament under which he Ues; being overheard
by a disappointed rival the unfortunate L o v e , is apprehended : h s Farther one of the Council who examined the
youth lelt himself bound to join in pronouning Sentence of Death upon him, and is appointed to give the signal.
The meeting between the Father and Son is a scene of affecting and highly-wrought tenderness- l"he Point of
Honour is maintained by Durimel, in relusing to escape when in his Power, he will rather Die than disgrace his
Father. The solemn procession to the place of Execution; the handkerchief is bound round his head, the
Father gives the word of Command and rushes before the body of his Son, everyone is thrown into consternation,'
the relationship is discovered, and the deserter receives full pardon.

1 Ws Play is a translation from the German Comedy of Misanthrophi/ and Repentance, and is justly allowed by
all our critics, to be the most finished piece ever offered to the public : the parts of the Stranger and Mrs. Halter,
are exquisitely drawn, and must inrerest every feeling breast. In the Stranger we behold a Man pos<ewl of
a benevolent heart, with feeling and humanity for lus Icllow creatures, yet, (by the hard usage of thi iVorlJ,
and the misconduct of a beloved wife^, those noble virtues are clouded by Misairthrophv. The description ot his
wife's perfidy to his friend, he concludes with the hope1; of finding rest in the world to coine.
"JGod, O
Cod, trure is another ami a better warlf1" In short the unbounded applause aird distinguished approbation this
piece Inis, and still continues to receive at .lie Drury lane Theatie, and every other Theatre in the kingdom
convinces that it need only be seen to be admired.

marked the glorious Reign of Queen Elizabeth; the disgrace and death of that amiable and unfortunate Nobleman the Duke of Norfolk -, the imprisonment, condemnation, and execution, of the beautiful and accomplished
Queen Mary, who after 20 Years cruel confinement, without an advocate to plead her cause, fell a victim to the
Unjust decisions of those who had no right but that of Power to condemn her , sentence of death was accordingly
pronounced against her, which she heard with a calm and serene aspect, and submitted to the Executioner without fear, amidst a croud of Spectators, who beheld her sufferings with pity and distress.

A celebrated Tragedy, (never

Roman Father.
Written by W. Whitehead, Poet Lauraet to the King, and altered by J. P. Kemble.
The contending States of Rome and Alba, harrassed with a long and destructive war, agree to choose tliri»e
champions oat of each camp, to terminate the contest. Sequinius, an illustrious Alban, had two daughters : one
he married to a citizen of Rome, the other to a citizen of Alba, and these two women had each of them, on the
tame day, three male children, al! remarkable for their strength and dexterity in fighting. The Alban and Roman Directors cast their eyes on the six brothers, now in the flower of their youth, to decide by their swords the
fortune of their country. When the day appointed came, the young warriors were led into the plain where the
ttoo Kings met—the combat began—the Albans were slain, and only one Roman survived. As lie was returning
in triumph to the city, he beheld ins sister, the beautiful Horatia (who was to have married cne of the Alban
champions) hurrying to meet her victorious brother; but seeing him wear her lover's military robe, all stained
with his blood, hill ot distraction, she tore h e . hair, and reviled her brother in the bitterest terms, who, enraged
at her reproaches, stabbed her witu his sword For this cruel deed he was arraigned upon an accusat on of muider. The distracted lather appealed to an assembly of the people, and the King, through admiration of his courage, and services to his country, revoked the sentence that wa* pronounced against him.

Historical Plays are m-re particularly calculated to claim the attention and interest the feelings of the
Auditors, wherein the heroic deeds of our illustrious Fore-Fathers in distant ages are recorded, and bv

remarkable period of the English History, when the Great Earl of Warwick, led" the Army of Edward of
York, against the house of Lancaster, and finally jaised Edward to the throne of England, defea.in» inseveral battles the Warlike Margaret of Anjou, Queen to King ITjnry the Sixth, the exploits of Warwiek
as a General and Politician, entitled him to the Appellation of " T h e Setter up and Puller down of
Kings," a title at this time recognized in the Person of a continental Warrior of the present age, differing
however in this respect. Warwick conscientiously gave the Sceptre to him he thought, would wield it

THE GAMESTER,
Or, Fatal Extravagance.
WRITTEN BY T H E REV. DR. HOADLEY.
No Task can be more useful than exposing Vice to merited Abhorrence, and holding up to public Scorn Enormities which
deserve general Execration. Exhibitions, like these, instruct beyond whole Volumes of Moral Precepts, which are generally
found too feeble to influence the Conduct in the Hour of Temptation.
Hence may the Gamester learn, ere yet too late.
Te shun that Vice which endless Ills awaits ;
Wild as the sea his maddening passions
flow.
Himself, Wife, Children, beggaed at a Throw.

j

Oh, should a Father or a Husband come,
Whom Dice have hied from happiness and Home,
To listen to qur Tale—our Hope is here.
To check one GAMESTER in his mad Career.

celebrated and most admired TRAGEDY

of

Or, T h e Fatal Marriage.
* (Altered by Mr.

GARRICK.)

No author since the days of S'vAcspear, possesses so sure a clue to atl the lab3'rinths of the Heart. The tragic parts of this play hafe been always
esteemed extremely natural and interesting; it is built upon the agonies of a mind of keen sensibility, when knowing to have wedded a second HtiJband while the first was Living. The keen distresses of Ifirure, and Isabella, are powerful_ifppea!s to the Heart, and work up the feelings of the Spectator by irresistable nature.
•. Of a play, which die wonderful powers of Mrs. SlDDON§, have so lately gi.en iis ntmost force, the re- olleciion of her exquisite performance, in
this particular part, will be the best eulogy of the author who could thus furnish the scenes best adapted to her talents.

W R I T T E N BY THE HONORABLE ST. JOHN.
The calamities of the Great seldom fail to create pity and compassion. The Author in this very affecting Piece, has
closely adhered to tho Truths of History ;.it contains many striking and interesting Events, particularly, the Disgrace
and Death of that amiable and unfortunate Nobleman, the Duke of Norfolk: the imprisonment, condemnation, and
execution of the beautiful and accomplished Queen Mary, who alter twenty Years cruel confinement, estranged from
all Society; no Hope to soften her Captivity, no Bosom to receive her Tears, no Advocate to plead her cause, fell a
victim to the unjust decision of those who had no right but that of power, to' cdn.lemn her; sentence of Death was accordingly passed upon her, which she heard with a calm and serene aspect, and submitted to the Executioner without
fear, amidst a crowd of Spectators, who beheld her sufferings with Pity ami Distress.

It i hit be gentle, it drops balmy dews
Of true repentance: but if proud and gloomy,
i t is a poison-tree, that pierced to die inmost
Weeps only tears of poison!

The Author has taken the outline of this Play from the Reign of Philip the 2nd, King of Spain, just at the close of the civil
wars against the Moors, and during the persecution wbtcb raged against them, shortly after the edict whi h forbade the wearing
of the Moresco Dress under pain of death. The language is nervous and bold, the plot interesting, the situations new, an 4

EVANDER, the good old King, is doomed by the Tyrant Dionysius, (whose Character bean a itrong resemblance to Bona,

with painful toil, prevails on Philotas to behold her Father; he, touched with filial piety, removes the bars from the Dunge.n
•door and chains which hold him to the Earth; she with the milk designed f.r her own offspring, on the parent's life allays the
parching fever. Philotas affected at this interview, consents to remove him to some safe shelter. Euphrasia will not consent I .
the base proposals of Dionysius, he orders her father to be brought before them; Philotas tells him he saw his last sigh and th «w
Lis body down the steep rock into the foaming surge. The Tyrant enraged at this, is determined upon her death Evander
eaters from the tomb, and the instant the Friead is raising Ins sword, Euphrasia rushes between them, and with her own arm
preserves a father's life.

THE CELEBRATED TRAGEDY OF THE

EARL OF ESSEX;

The Author has throughout the Piece, strictly adhered to Historical Facts : it exhibits some of the
most striking and interesting Events that marked the Reign of Q U E E N ELIZABETH, particulaily the
Disgrace and Death of that distinguished Nobleman and unfortunate Favorite, the EARL of ESSEX.
The fifth Act is worked up with more Art and Nature, and is as impressive and affecting in its termination as any Play which the English Stage has hitherto produced. The keen Distresses of the unhappy
Earl, and the Distraction of his amiable and beloved Countess, when summoned by the Guards to the
Execution, are powerful Appeals to the Heart, and work up the Feelings of the Spectator with
irresistible effect.

This Play (written by Thomas Morton, Esq.) is always popular, not only for the celebrity of its author,
but as well from the very excellent moral lesson it displays, and was intended as a compliment to the
patrons of the philantropic school, whose patriotic and benevolent exertions to reclaim the misguided
culprit, and restore him a useful member of society, is one of the proudest and most exalted illustrations
of British benevolence, and cannot fail to afford delight to its Auditors.

Will be presented, Shakespeare's celebrated historical Play, called,

CYMRELINE
King of

o

9

Britain,

OR, T H E I N J U R E D P R I N C E S S .
This Tragedy is founded on a period of time soon after the Romans became Masters of Britain,
Shakespeare has followed the history in those early ages pretty close. There is through the whole Play, a
d«al of btisile, plot, and incident, similar to the lime from whence it was taken. The noble defence
teade by Posthumus, Bellarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus, in a Grand Fight between the Romans and
Britons, who by their single valour turned the fortune of Battle, and put the Romans to flight, convinces
us our ancestors were possessed of courage, (if not of discipline) equal to those Masters of the World,
as they were then stiled. Cymbeline's discovery of his lost sons, who had been stolen from him and
bred up under tne tuitiou of old Bellarius, gives a pleasing turn to the Piece, and Posthumus's finding
Imogen living, and innocent, not only winds up the Plot, agreeable to the rules of criticism, but must
both affect and please a judicious Audience.
