As the legal question in respect to the Performance of Lord Byron’s Tiagedy is still to be discussed, much remark, as to what has passed, would be, at present, unnecessary and improper. Nothing has been done, on the part of the Theatre, in this affair, which has not. in numberless instances, occurred before; and the practice of Theatres, in such cases, will, no doubt, continue the same, unless the law shall show it to be erroneous. On one point, however, it is material to guard against misapprehension. It has been somewhere suggested, that the manner in which this Play was produced originated in sordid motives. If this refers to the fact of the Text having been obtained from the Publication, that fact justifies no such inference. The noble Author is fully aware, as his immediate Friends and Agents in this country are, that any Compensation for the first possession of his valuable Work, within the capability of the Theatre to offer, and which such an Author could have condescended to accept, was at his command; and that, in the tender submitted to his Lordship, while the Tragedy was understood to be in progress, all possible delicacy and attention were observed, as to the mode by which such object of compensation could be effected His Lordship's Publisher, also, well knows that there was an earnc>.t deposition to admit him to a participation in the Benefit of the Performance, could the Performance have taken place before the Publication. So far, the public mind should be, at once, set right When the Possessor of this Theatre shall reject any literary effort, as unsuited to stage use, and shall, afterwards, ou publication, attempt to make such materials available, then, and not until then, will he plead guilty to a disposition to withhold from genius the reward to which it is entitled; and to which a stronger claim could not have existed, than in the present interesting and splendid instance.

PROGRAMME of the OPERA
Ti he kingdom of Thrace haviag incurred the wrath of Apollo, had been compelled by the God, yearly to immolate a Virgin on his altar. Demophoon, the King, having consulted !he Oracle as to the means of averting this sacrifice, received the following answer:
* *
4 Heaven1» wrath shall to himself is known
Tjkeinnoeeni usurper of a ¿krone ! "
The Opera commence* at the time of the approaching Sacrifice, when the name« of ah the Thracian Virgins, are ordered to be placed in an Urn, from which the victim in to be drawn by lot. Cleanthes, a Thracian noMema/i, agitated by fear for his daughter, Dire«, reproaches the King with sending his own daughters away, to save them from, the hazard pf the Urn; and Demophoon, irritated at hi« boldness, orders Birce to be sacrificed, without waiting for its decision.
Dirce is the wife of Timanthes, who is believed to be the eldest soil of Demophoon, But as the Thracian laws ordain death to any subject who weds with, royal blood, their union is kept secret. Demophoon, sending for Timanthes from the c'amp, destines him to marry Lysia, Princess of Phrygia, who has been conducted to Thrace by Cherinihm, Deinophoon’s youngest son. Timanthes learning the danger of Dirce, betrays his passion to hi* father, by his earnest entreaties in her behalf, and her fate, is consequence, becomes more inevitable. Timanthe.-, in despair, then attacks the Guards conducting Dire«, and sets her free, but yiehiewhen he meets his father, overcome by his reproache«. Dirce is about to be sacrificed, when Tinianthes confesses their marriage, and they aae both condemned to die, by the violated law. Demophoon, however, overcome by the entreaties of Lysia and Chermthus, consents to <*avc theta both amd acknowledge Diree his daughter. In the midst: of joy Timardhes is struck with horror by receiving a paper from Cleanthes,yylttch proves Dirte to fee the daughter of Demophoon ; he casts her from him, but k restored to happiness by discovering from another document, that he himself is the son of Cleanthes, and the " Innocent Usurper" alluded to by the Oracle.
Apollo’s wrath ceases, the dieadfu! sacrifice is abolished, aijd Chcriatkus now ike Heir of Thrace espouse* Ljsia.

SECOND NIGHT OF THE NEW GRAND SERIOUS OPERA, cabled
DIRCE; or, The Fatal Urn. ’
The first representation of the
NEW NERIO! S OPERA,
which was given for the Benenfit o/'Miss Wilson, was honoured with universal Approbation. The object of this production, is to render a Recitative ¡drama {so long the admiration of Foreign Countries) worthy the exalted Patronage of the British Nation. How far this object has been attained, can be honestly left to the decision of the Public. The Opera has been some months in preparation, and every care has been taken to make it worthy of a National Theatre. It is alloiced to be performed on Benefit nights, that its success may not be unnecessarily impeded, and with a wish on the pari of the Propri~ tor to serve those Performers who hold a high estimation with the Public.
PROGRAMHi; of the OPERA.
The kingdom of Thrace having incurred the wrath of Apollo, had been compelled by the f>od, yearly to immolate a Virgin on bis altar. Demophoon, the liing, having consulted the Oracle as to the means of averting this sacrifice, received the following answer:
*
w Heavens wrath shall cease9 when, to hint-self is known
“ The innocent usurper of a throne l ”
The Opera commences at the time of the approaching Sacrifice, when the names of all the Thracian Virgins, are ordered to be placed in an Uru, from which the victim is to bo drawn by lot. Cleanthcs, a Thracian nobleman, agitated by fear for his daughter, Dirce, reproaches the King with sending his own daughters away, to save them from the hazard of the Urn; and Demophoon, irritated at his boldness, orders Dirce to be sacrificed, without waiting for its decision.
Dir'-e is the wife of Timanthes, who is believed to be the eldest son of Demophoon. But as the Thracian lawfc ordain death to any subject who weds with royal blood, their union is kept secret. 1 ’emophoon, sending for Timanthes from the camp, destines him to marry Lysia, Princess of Phrygia, who has been conducted to Thrace by Cherinllms, Demophoon’s youngest son. Timanthes learning the danger of Dirce, betrays his passion to his father, by his earnest entreaties in her behalf, and her fate, in consequence, becomes more inevitable. Tinranthe«, in despair, (hen attacks the Guards conducting Dirce, and sets her f ree, but y ields when he meets his father, overcome by his reproaches. Dirce is about to be sacrificed, when Timanthes confesses their marriage, and they are both condemned to die, by the violated law. Demophoon, however, overcome by the entreaties of Lysia and Cherinthus, consents to save them both and acknowledge Dirce his daughter.

THE
NEW SERIOES OPERA,
Which was produced on Saturday fast, for the Benefit of Mis* Wilson, and repeated last night, was again honoured with universal Approbation. The object efthis production, is to render a Recitative tèrama (so lug the admiration of Foreign Countries) worthy the exalted Patronage of the British Nation. I low far this object has been attained, can be honestly left to the decision of the Public. The Opera has been some months in preparation, and every care has been taken to make it worthy of a National Theatre. It is alloiced to be performed on Benefit nights, that its success inay not be unnecessarily impeded, and icith a wish on the ]tart of the Prcpritot to serve those Performers who hold, a high estimation with the Public.
PROGRAMME of the OPERA.
Thp kingdom of Thrace having incurred the wrath of Apollo, had been compelled by the God, yearly to immolate a Yi:g n bis altar. Demopheoii, the King. having consulted *he Oracle as to the'means of averting this sacriflce, received the following answer:
“ Heavens wrath shall cease9 when to him-self is known
“ The innocent usurper of a throne ! ”
4
The Opera commences at the time of the sppioaching Sacrifice, when the name« of all the /. raeian Virgins, are ordered to be placed in an Li.., from which the victim is to u« drawn by loir Cleanthes, a Thracian nobleman, agitated by fear for his daughter, Dirce, reproaches the, King with sending li s own daughters away, to save them from tiie hazard of the Urn; ami Hemophoon, irritated at h's boldness, orders j) irct* to be sacrificed, w ithout waiting for its decision.
Dirce is the wife of Timanthes, who is believed to be ti*‘ eldest con of Demophoon. Rut as the Thracian laws ordain death to any subject who weds with royal blood, their union is kept secret. Demophoon, sending for Timanthes from the camp, destines him to marry Lysia, Princess of Phrygia, who has been conducted to Thrace by Cherinfbns, Oeraophoon’s youugest son. Tiaianthes learning the danger of Dirce, betrays lus, passion <o hk father, by his earnest entreaties in her behalf, and her fate, in consequence, becomes more inevitable Tinianthe-?, iu despair, then attacks the Guards conducting Dirce, and sets her free, but yields when lie meets his father, overcome by his reproaches. Dirce is about to be sacrificed, when Timanthes confesses their marriage, and they are both condemned to die, by the \iolated law. Demophcon, however, overcome by the entreaties of Lysia and Chcrinthus, consents to save them both and acknowledge Dirce liis daughter. In the midst of joy Timanthes is struck with horror by rccehing a paper from Cleantbes, which proves Dirce to be the, daughter of Demophoou ; be cast« her from him, but is restored to happiness by di-co’ering from soother document, that he himself is the son of Clcanthes, and the “ Innocent Usurper” alluded to by the Grade.
Apollo’s wrath ceases, the drea^fal suc.iStL is abehsln'd, on! C herinthirc now the Ihi ef I h.icc espouse? I,’sin.
