MACBETH
Will be Performed at this Theatre

On W E D N E S D A Y , May 10, 1820,
In which he will make his First Appearance

In the Character

of iWacbeth,

For the purpose of pointing out an erroneous construction of a Passage in this great Author, which the above mentioned justly admired Actors have fallen into. The various
Readings given to the different Texts of Shakspeare, have perpetually furnished subjects of
controversy, and will ever be a subject of interest to all Person* of taste and literature.—
Mr. F I T Z G E R A L D has not been induced to undertake this task, from an arrogant desire
to display talents not yet called into public action, but from a conviction that each individual
who adds an additional ray to the lustre of Shakspeare's name, contributes his mite to the
cause of Scenic Art and Dramatic Literature! Anxious to render the Performance more worthy
of public patronage, he has engaged

Miss MACAULEY,
Who will make her First Appearance in Public since her late severe Illness, in the Character of

Miss B O Y C E has the honor to inform her Friends and the Public in general, that it is her intention
to take a Benefit at the above Theatre,

This Evening, WHIT-MONDAY, May 22nd, 1820,
Her pretentions to patronage are founded on the following statement:—She has for Sixteen Years been a
Member of the Company of the Theatre Koyal Drury Lane, but a train of Misfortunes, and Illness, of the
most severe kind, have of late prevented her from pursuing her Profession, and she is now obliged to appeal to
the Benevolence of those who have known her, and to the Sympathy of Strangers, for their Support in this her
most trying situation. The kindness of the Proprietor of the Theatre Royal Hay Market, affords her the Use
of the House free of Expence, a favor she is proud thus to acknowledge; and 'she flatters herself that the Entertainmeuts announced, will have the stamp of much approved Merit of the first magnitude, for the attainment
of which she is indebted to the general good-will of the Performers, and to the sanction and liberality of the
Managers, of the principal Theatres.
The Evening's Knteitainments will commence with SHERIDAN'S celebrated Comedy of The
