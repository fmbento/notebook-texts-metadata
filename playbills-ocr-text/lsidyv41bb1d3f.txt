Great Novelty!
oiTSATURDAY EVENING, MAY lltli, 1833,
Will be presented the celebrated Drama, called TWENTY YEARS OF A
Gambler’s Life:
OR,	0
The Ilut of the Red Mountain.
This Piece token from real life, and which has been nightly represented to crowded audiences, at the Theatre of Port St. Martin, in Paris, has excited a stronger sensation in that capital than any Melo Drama that has been produced there for many years. The frightful extent to wnich the rage of Gaming has spread in that city, and the fatal results to which it too often leads, have apparently induced the highly-talented author to direct the utmost force of his pen ngainst the destructive vice; and never, perhaps, have its consequences been pourtriyed in so strong a light, nor the wretchedness, guilt, and despair, which arise from its being so vividly illustrated as in this Drama, it professes to represent the life of a Gamester; but as it is impossible to present, on the stage, in a continued series, the transactions of so long ft period, the occurrences of sixteen hours, at different periods of his life ; and separated by intervals of twenty years, constitute each Act or part of the Drama, which, it is confidently anticipated, will be found one of the most powerfully interesting and impressive ever transferred from the French to the English Stage.

Scene 2d.— The Hut of the Red Mountain.
Abject misery of jhc Gamester’s Family, in a state of starvation, and about to be turned from the hovel— his arrival with provisions, the produce of his dreadful crime—re-appearance of Malcour, reduced to a common beggar—continued infatuation of the Gamblers—arrival of Henry—recognition of his mother, the distress of the Gamester about to be relieved~he is prevented by his wife from the murder of hiB own son— his vengeance on Malcour—and the dreadful termination of the life of a Gamester!

If we may at all augur from its fuccels in London, it only wants to have its merits lufficiently known to become equally popular in the Country, in London it produced overflowing houfes for forty Night! : indeed the t •centric whim fn the charader of Goldfinch, the happy mixture of comic fituation, moral fentiment, and laughable dialogue» throughout this Play, isalmoft unparalleld. Perhaps the Newmarket Sportlman was never better drawn, and the feelings of an heart broken Father, tormented by the diffipationof a beloved Son, aie finely delineated. The termination is happy, and conclufion forcib le in the reformation and return to duty and affedion of Young Dornton.

Queen of Scots. .
This unfortunate Princefs has been the fubjed of many hiftoriar.s, and has afforded our Poet as large a feope for a Tragic Story as any Annals of this Nation: the hiftory of the unfortunate'Mary Queen of Scots, is lufficiently known : her fufferings and long imprifonment might furely have atoned for any Female frailties ihc had been drawn Into: but there feemed political motives for bringing this unfortunate Princefs to the Block, attended with fuel»
aggravating circumftances of cruelty, as is fcarcelv to be parallels in our hiftory.-Her noble deportment, her
pious reiignation to her fate, her tender parting with Lady Douglas and her Maids ; her charitable forgivenefs of her perfccutors, and her firmnefs in meeting death on a Public Scaffold, are traits that muft refeue her Fame, and afford a judicious A'udienre the pleafing fenl'ation of fheding a Tear of Sympathy, at the fame time it harmonizes the the mind to Virtuous feelings and delight.

♦otringextradls:-The scene of Obi is very extensive. This Obi, or as it is pronounced in the English, West Indies, Obeah
has its origin like many customs among the Africans, from the ancient Egyptians, Obi, for the purpose of bewitching people, or eensutcittg them by lingering illness, is made of grave dirt, hair, ieetb ol sharks and other animals, blood, feathers, egg shells images in wax, the hearts of birds, livers of mice, and sum1* potent roots, weeds, and bushes, of which Europeans are at this time ignorant. A negro who thinks himself bewitched by Obi, will apply to an Obi woman for cur*. The most wrinkled and
most deformed Obian magicians are most venerated,.The learned author of the work we have profited bv, says, "I SAW
THE OBI OF THE FAMOUS NEGRO ROBBER, THREE FINGERED JACK, the terror of Jamaica in 1780, it consisted df* goats hoin, hile.l with various compounds; these, wi*h a keen sabre and two guns, were ati is Obi, with which and his courage in descending into the plains, and plundering to supply his wants, and his skill us retreating among the mountains, commanding the only access to them, where none dared to fullow him, he terrihed the inhabitants, and set the civil power and the ■neighbouring militia of the island at defiance for near two years. At length allured by the rewards oifeted by Governor Dalling two negroes named Quashee and Sam, engaged to encounter jack, and after a bloody coriflidl, overpo> ered him and killed him* and with their sabres cut of Jack’s head and his Tbree-fingcred hand, and took them in triumph, followed by a vast concourse of negroes, now no longer afraid of Jack’s Obi, blowing their shells and horns, and filing guns in their rude method. In this manner they procccdd to Kingston and claimed the rewards offered by proclamation

On SATURDAY Evening April 24th, 1813.
\\ ¡L be presented the admit ed Melò Dramatic PLAY, never pafotmed here, tf
The Travellers Benighted
OR 1
The Forest of Rosenwald.
This unrivalled, popular and most interesting Play, commences with Don Felix wishing his Son to Tra vii ; fearing his health will be impaired lay his too constant Study. Raymond sets forth and sees Agnes, who his leaving the Convent, in which she has been educated, and instantly becomes enamoured with her, but is prevented from expressing his admiration by the vigilance of her Duenna.
Claude, a Postillion, who is connected with a band of Robbers, that infest a Forest thro' which they pass, breaks the carriiage in which Raymond Travels, as if by accident, and betrays him to the Bandi tti under pretence of finding shelter for the night. Raymond encounters a variety of adventures, and finally escapes with Agnes and her Duenna, who have also been conducted by a treacherous guide to this
ABODE OF HORROR,
and reaches the Castle of Lindenberg unmolested ; the Baron receives him with kindness as the protector of Agnes, but being informed that he is paying his addresses to her, he instantly dismisses him from the Castle, Agnes is determined to follow his fortunes, and informs him of her intention of personating a bleeding Nun, (which is reported nocturnally to preambulate the Castle Walls, exactly at one o’Clock,) by dropping from a window this Scroll.
“ When the Castle Bell tolls one, A “ Expect me like the Bleeding Nun,”
Delighted with this information, he punctually attends and as the Clock strikes one, the Spectre of a Nun with a Lamp in one hand and a Dagger in the other, it appears Raymond supposeing it to be Agnes, follows and attempts to embrace it on which it vanishes and in its room appears a transparency with this inscription.
Protect the Child of the Murdered Agnes!
Agnes not meeting with Raymond sets out in search of him and falls a second time into the hands of the Banditti, but is happily rescued by Raymond’s timely interference, and this interesting Piece concludes with their offering of thankfulness and gratitude to that Providence who never fails.

On Saturday Evening May 20th, 1821 :
W ill be presented, an entire New TRACED V, now performing throughout the United Kingdom, with unbounded Applause, called The.
Murdered Maid;
Or, The Clock Struck Four!!!
This Drama is founded on a Murder which was committed in Warwickshire, in the Spring of 1817» a crime which excited one universal feeling of horror and indignation.— Great was the regret of all, that a person whom there was too much reason to believe, the perpetrator of this dreadfull act, was suffered to escape condign punishment.
In viewing well this act of dark despair,	,
Of Crimes like his Oh! giddy youth beware;
May virtue, sence arid honor, hold control,
Ere furious passions stain the spotless soul.
The purposes of the Drama are best auswered, when they most promote the sacred cause of virtue and morality In these scenes every disgusting circumstance is carefully omitted, and if additions are made to the facts familiar to public knowledge, they are inserted, with the intention of enabling the spectator to extract from this Play, a conformation of the great moral lesson.—Th at although vice may for a time triumph, a merciful but just Providence fails not to punish in this world, as well as in a future state, the perpetration of a crime, which in the present instance we so much deplore.
“ Offence’s guilded hand may shove by justice,
“ And oft ’tis seen’ the wicked prize itself “ Buys out the law, but ’tis not so above;
“ There is no shuffltng; there the action lies “ In its true nature”

murdered maid,
this SEASON.
Theatre Aston Street, Shiffnal,

¡ISf:
«8*
&

On Saturday Evening June 9th, 1821 ;
Will be presented, an entire New TRAGEDY,now performing through" out the United Kingdom, with unbounded Applause, called The
Murdered Maid;
Or The Clock Struck Four.
1 liis Drama is founded on a Murder which was committed in Warwickshire, in t he opring of IS 17, a crime which excited one universal feeling of horror and indignation.™ 'feat was the regret of all, that a person whom there was too much reason to believe, the perpetrator ot this dreadfull act, was suffered to escape condign punishment,
In viewing well this act of dark despair,
Of Crimes like his Oh! giddy youth beware;
May virtue, senee and honor, hold control,
Kre furious passions stain the spotless soul.
Jl he purposes of the Drama are best answered, when they most promote the sacred cause °* j'rt)16 and morality In these scenes every disgusting circumstance is carefully omitted, and it additions are made to the facts familiar to public knowledge, they are inserted, with the intention of enabling the spectator to extract from this Play, a conformation of the great moral lesson.—That although vice may for a time triumph, a merciful but just Providence fails not to punish in this world, as well as in a future state, the perpetration of a crime, which in the present instance we so much deplore.
“ Offence’s guilded hand may shove by justice,
“ And oft ’tis seen’ the wicked prize itself “ Buys out the law, but ’tis not so above;
“ "1 here is no shuffling; there the action lies “in its true nature”	Shakespeare.

This present MONDAY, October 10, 1808, will be presented, the favourite Play of
George Barnwell;
Or, THE	LONDON .
Since the fust institution of the Theatres, to the present day, no Dramatic Piece has been of more service to Society, *! an this admirable Play; and if to point out'■ the allurements of vice, asa warning to unthinking youth to »void the snares of debauchery, he the business of the stage, its power has never been more justly or more effectually exerted — The crimes and misfortunes of the unhappy George Barnwell are held up as an awful Monitor t Youth; and, amongst other instances of the great influence ofstage effect over the passions, the following anecdote is a lasting proof of its las-cinating power, both to improve t he rtiorals and mend the heart:
In L oudon, some few (years since, a Young Gentleman in the mercantile line, had, in an unguarded moment, made free with a considerable sum of money, the property of his employer. Chance that evening directed him to l)rurv Lane Theatre, where the per ormance of Mr. Ross, in the character of George Barnwell, struck his mind so forcibly, that selfconviction, attended by severe remorse, compelled himto replace the money so disgracefully obtained; and Dy a life of strict honour and probity ever after, he amply atoned for a temporary deviation from the rules of virtue.
“ I've heard that guilty creature«, tilting at a play, have, by the veiy cunning of the tecne, been struck, to the soul, that presently they have proclaimed their malefaction* —Shaklspf.au*.
So sensible was this gentleman that to the Theatre alone he stood indebted for this happy change, he ever after presented Mr. Ross, on his benefit night, with an Hundred Pound Bank Note for a Ticket, and constantly acknowledged -his obligations to this excellent Play; a Play that will engraft such excellent principles on young minds, as to conduce to then-future happiness, through the pleasing medium of a rational entertainment—w here instruction rs so blended with amusement.	.	,

At length, he tbok an opportunity of unbosoming himself to Wilford, his secretat), a youth whofe curiosity had led him to pry into his master’s every look and action, atid by his conduct had lijd himfclf open to hit confidence, and Sir Edward at once, after binding this youth by the most horrid oaths, confesses to him the Narrative of the Murder, but from that hour dreads and abhors the sight of him; fearing he, should betray his fatal secret, and blackens His character, hjr accusing him of robbing him ) and so art ■ iVHv contrives it, as to have several articles of value, which had lain in his Iron Chest, placed in Wilford’a boje. But what can elude the ALL-SEEING EVE OF PROVIDENCE, that will no' suffer the Guilty to-escape, nor Innocence to go unrewarded f Sir Ed\vsrd had heedlessly cohveyed into the box, with other articles, the vciy Knife with which he Committed the Murder, and a written Narrative of the Fact. Thus knowu to the world for a Murderer arid an Assassin, li# nevermore raised his head, but in a state of madnei* and agonizing torture, falls a dreadful example to all around him—Mr. Cot,m ah received for this Play, from the Proprietors of Drury-lane, the Sum of ipoo Guineas.

(FOR THREE NIGHTS ONLY).	v 7
At the opening of the Iheatre, it cannot but be mojl highly gratifying to Mr. Crisp, to have it in his Power to announie to the Ladies and Gentlemen of Shrewfburv/ that ali-aceomplijhtd and very unrivalled Atlrefs, Mifs DUNCAN, ’ * from the Theatres Royal, Drury-Lanc, and Covent-Garden.
Shrewsbury Theatre, 1810.
The particulai* San&ion that Dramatic Entertainments now receive (in inch * an increafed degree); equally itl every part of the World as they do in this Kingdom, while it proves their intrinfic Value and their Ufe, fixes the Drama not only as the ftandard of rational and highly pleafing Amuferaent, but it at the fame Time eftablifttes the Theatre fts the faithfuil Mirror, in which we may conftantly behold all the powerful fway of Beauty, ilill more ornamented by every becoming Elegancy of prevailing Fafliion.
The Manager then looks with Pleafure to the opening of the Shrewibury Theatre j—and which he begs Leave to ftate, will be
On MONDAY EVENING, SEPT, the 3d.
Feeling himfelf milch honored for Favors pail, and in.'the founded expectation of particular Patronage, which he is led to believe will attend the prefent Seafon, he is bound to return his fincereil Thanks for fuch kindnefs ; and ac-
2uaints the Ladies and Gentlemen of Shrewibury, that the Theatre is now tted up in a ftyle of Embellifiiment that he hopes will meet the Approbation of his refpeCtable Guefts; which it- lhall always be his aim to deferv'e, by attentively (and he hopes fatisfadorily) filling every part of his Situation as the Direftor of their Entertainments.
Altho* kd mired and approved good Plays Will be cohftantly given, as being the proper Foundation of Dramatic Entertainments.—Yet the ornamental, the pleafing SuperltruCture, the jocund Song, the merry Dance, the enlivening Pantomime, with ail the many-varied Efforts of Amufement which the Stage can offer, ihall by no means be overlooked ; but will moll frequently be pre-lented, in order to diverfify the Scene, and fecure the more perfect gratification of the Company who will honor him by their appearance.
Among the Performers, this Seafon will prefent many new Fkces, and he believes with much ihare of Talent: ihould thefe be approved of by the Town, in the manner that {dr. Crifp hopc3 for, their Value will be very materially encreafed in his Eftimatiofu
First of Miss Duncan’s three Nights.
On MONDAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER the THIRD, i87o,

While Mr. Crisp will consider himself as much indebted to ali who may please to honor the Theatre with their presence, he begs Leave, among his other Friends, to acquaint the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Country surrounding Shrewsbury, who often favor him by coming long Distances, that all unnecessary Waits or Protractions between the Acts, which would tend to delay thu Company, shall be most sedulously avoided : and every general Arrangement will be made to render the Amusements of the Theatre all that they ought to be—a constant, and desirable Source ofra'ional and highly recreative Amusements.	_
Ot that necessary Object, the WELL-AIRING of the House, there is the most obvious Prool. The Interior Part of it has been painted (no Oil Colours) above two Months—it has been open every Day for more than twelve Weeks, with a constant Fire on the Stage : and the Manager feels much obliged to those Ladies and GentlemeH, who during that Peiitxl did him the Favor to look in, and express their entire Satisfaction at what was going forward.	>
Every Evening ol Performance, the Theatre will successively present a Routine of the most interesting Entertainments—in as high^i Degree calculated to please the Town, as the Manager .« best Endeavours can produce—in the Selection of which, he will be always guided by flung on those whic'li w ill appear likely to meet the most approving Voice of the Public.
ilv1 Every Thing, as far as"can coroe within his Power, shall be attended to, that may promise to give general Satisfaction.	I
*4-'* Objections having been made to the fights in Front efi the Stage during the last Season, they have been removed, and new ones substituted, which he hones will be amroved of.

The Scene lies in Savoy. A person named Francisco has been received into the house of Bnnatno, who, ignorant of his story, is not disposed to harbour him. Franciscu has been deprived of his tongue, but is able to deliver his thoughts in writing. Fiamelta has found Froficisco about 5 years before the commencement of the piece in an expiring slate, mangled by ruffians, and by the assistance of Michefti, »n honest miller, the wretched man is preserved. Rqmaldi, joined by his servant Mel voglio and knowing Franehco, sleeps in Bonatno's bouse, determined in the dead of night to murder him. Selina overhears them, and gives information to Francisco. Tli* ruffians approach, but Francisco being armed prevents the execution of their wicked purpose for soole time : at length under the per,union that lie will not fire, they rush upon him ; but the screams of Selina, who has beep upon tile watch, bring all the family to their detection.
M Rural Dance by the Characters.
*• «/
The lovers are now on the point of being married, when n letter arrives affirming that Selina is the daughter .of Francisco, and the clutd of guilt; that she is obtruded on fionamo by the baseness of Romahli. The honest miller who had saved Francisco, a (Fords shelter to Koin.ildi. At length Francisco and Selina arrive at the same spot, and tile horror they discover at the sight of Roraaldi, induces the miller to run for the officers. Romaldi in the mean time offers his pistol to Francisco, to revenge himself for the injury he has received, but rather than impeach his brother he throws the pistol away. Bonaino ami the rest of the characters assemble on the spot, and Romaldi repents ol his wickedness. The piece concludes with the restoration ol Seiina to Stcphkno, and the avowal of an application for mercy in behalf of Komaldi.

POINT of HONOR.
As represented at the Theatre Royal, Hay-Market, with the greatcfl Applgufe. Taken from a German Original, and adapted to the Englilh Stage by Mr. C. Kemble.
The following Sketch of the Story will clearly evince how very interfiling and truly affefling are the
incidents of this admirable Play.	{
DURIMEL, a Soldier in Foreign Service having been provoked to llrike an officer, deferts from liis regiment, to avoid the punilhipent which awaitB fo glaring an infringement of the laws ot military fubordlnation. He is fortunate enough to procure mercantile employment in the houfe ot a Widow Lady, on the borders of Switzerland, and an attachment to her daughter Bertha, who returns his paflton, is, in a fhort time the confequence. The manly integrity of the young loldier induces him fo difeover to the mother, the predicament under which he lies ; the particulars being overheard by a difappointed rival, he communicate; the circumftance to the officers of the regiment, at that time quartered In the village. The unfortunate lover is immediately apprehended as a deferter. The interell of the drama now commences: Dummei lias not fee:: his father for many years, and the latter, in confequence of his gallant and meritorious fervices, had rifen from an inferior Ration in the army to be a Major in this very regiment, and being one of the Council who examined the youth, felt himfelf boupd to join in pronouncing (entente of death upon him, and is appointed to give the fatal fignal at the moment of the execution. The complicated diflrefs of a parent thus fltuated mud be obvious to every mind : the meeting between the Father and Son (in which tfie recognition of their mutual affinity takes place) produces a feene of melting and highly wrought tendernels.

PROGRAMME:
A Rivalry existing between two Forest Hunters, Wilhelm and Caspar, the latter invokes the potent assistance of Zajii*l, the Spirit of the F.rest, who grants him «EVEN CHARMED BULLETS, the propertiw of which are unerring aim. For this gift Caspar enters into a contract with Lucifer’s agent, Zamiel; the period of Caspar’s existence depending on the relaimnent of the Seventh Ball. Previous to t ie rising of the curtain, three Bulleis are supposed to have been expended, the Fourth wins the Prize of Uongeraliio fro n Wilhelm—the Fifth is employed to entrap ins Rival at an Eagle which is seen to hover in the air at ail immeasurable height; Wilhelm discharges it, and brings the Erigie to the ground—Caspar perceives Wilhelm's astonishment, and taking advantage of it, endeavours to entice him to THE WOLF’s GLEN, intending to seduce him to the acceptance of Seven Charmed Bullets, the possession of whieh would bind Wilhelm as Zamiel’s victim, and afford a new term of Ufa to Caspar. Tlrf1 Jiorrors of the WOLF’s GLEN are then developed.
THE INCANTATION
PROCEEDS—On casting the jFlR3T BITIiliET,
Tb* Skulls of former Victims completing the Boundary of the Magic Circle, glare hideously around. At catting the
SECOND BULLET,
The Circle appears surrounded with Venomous Animals and Reptiles*
THE THIRD BULLET
Conjures up Skeletons of Victims, the Birds of Prey, while monstrous Forms move through the Glen.
THE FOURTH BULLET
Raises a terrific Storm andllurricane. Trees arc cast down, Rocks arc split asunder, Meteors dart through theB ky.
THE FIFTH BULLET
Causes a complication of Horrors. The stage opens in all parts, and appears to vomit accumulated Terrors.
THE SIXTH BULLET
Illumines the Boundary of the Magic Circle ; produces the Wild Chacein the Air, with gk deton Horses, Dogs, and Stag ; while the
Mountain-torrent flews with Blood.
THE SEVENTH BULLET
M. I appea ,	,
The LAST SCKNB.M'he Trial of Skill, by tho SEVENTH CHARMED BALL, dischaifced by Killian, which smites Bertha, who being- under the protection of the Good Spirit of the Forest,

To which will he added the New Melo-Dramatic Entertainment, called THE
Travellers	,
Or, RAYMOND and AGNES.
SKETCH OF THE STORY.
Raymond having completed his studies, is entreated by his father to enter on his travels, he sets out, accom-pan ed by Theodore bis faithful domestic. On entering the confines of the forest ofHosenwald, night drawing on, he lose* his way, and by the treachery of his guide (Claude) he is led to the cottage of a woodman, (Bap-lista), the Captain of a Banditti, who assumes that disguise move securely to commit his depredations on the unwary traveller. Robert and Jacques (sons to Baptisla) return from their plunder in the forest, and enter armed Raymond is conducted to repose in a chamber. Baplista and sons lay a plot to murder him. Mar-guerette, in order to put Raymond on his guard, contrives to place a pillow stained with blood on his bed! Robert enters the chamber, and attempts the murder, but is prevented by Margueretle’s caution. Agnes and her governante now enter the cottage, being benighted in their journey to the castle of Lindenberg. Raymond, enamoured of Agnes, resolves on saving her; and Marguerette, giving him to understand, the wine which is offered is an opiate, he pretends to drink, and affects to sleep. The murderers, thinking their victim secure, leave them to Baptista, who is preparing to assassinate Agnes, when he meets his death by the very dagger he had raised against the bosom of sleeping innocence. Marguerette now points out the secret door, by which they escape, Raymond conducts Agnes to the castle of Limlenberg, and is received by the Baron and Countess (the only surviving relations of Agnes) with much attention. Raymond observing several portraits of a Nun with a wound in her breast, enquires her history. Agnes relates the
Story of the Bleeding Nun,
And tells him 'tis reported the spectre haunts the castle every fifth year. Raymond declares his passion for Agues, and is dismissed the castle. Agnes is told that the intention of the Countess, in sending for her to the castle, is to seclude her for ever from the world. Terrified at the idea, she determines to rely on the honour of Raymond's affection.—She drops a letter from the turret, in which she tells Raymond,
“ When the castle bell tolls One,
Expect me as the Bleeding Nun.’’
Raymond, enraptured at the idea of seeing Agnes, keeps his appointment. The bell tolls One, The castle gates fly open, and the apparition of the Bleeding Nun is pursued by Raymond. Agues, as the nun, now appears, and looks in vain for Raymond. She is met by Theodore, takes his protection. They are surprised by the banditti. Agnes confined in a cavern by Robert, Jacques, and Claude. Agnes rescued, and the piece concludes with the union of Raymond and Agues.

This play is founded on the celebrated Novel of' THE FORTUNES OF NIGELand the admirers of the great Novelist will receive a superior gratification from the representation, as those parts which in preceding dramas extracted from the lame source, were appropriated to musical compositions are in this filled up by f steady pursuit of the main object, the delineation of the incidents and Characters of the Original. It is ac counted the most perfect drama in the list of plays founded on the popular works of the Scotish Author, and on this account it cannot fail to interest and amuse those who are unacquainted with the original, while those who have read it will receive additional pleasure in contemplating with the corporeal eye what has so often delighted the mental vision.

On Friday, Oct. the 3d, 1823,
Will be performed an entire new Melo Drama (never acted here) called
Joan of Arc,
Or the Maid of Orleans.
History does not present us with a parallel to this EXTRAORDINARY FEMALE.—Her
Youth, her Beauty, her Bravery, and her Fate !-After performing prodigies of valour, she
was taken prisoner, and so much importance attached to her fate that it was regarded equal to a decisive Victory. Though her conduct'had been irreproachable, and she was entitled to be treated as a prisoner ot war, yet it was determined to try her on the then capital charge of SORCERY.—Religion was to be interested in this act of oppression, and the ( lergy, together with the University of Paris, a body destined for (he instruction of mankind, meanly supported the absurd charge; and this admirable Heroine, the scourge of her country’s enemies, and the deliverer of France, perished at the Stake, in the market-place of Rouen, in the Twenty second
year of her age! Such was the end ot this famous Maid of Orleans, whose actions must
excite surprise and admiration, whether they were owing to Innate Con rage, or resulted from the Effects of Enthusiasm.

ned, The hour was fixed when the King and his whole Parliament were assembled, naught remained hut the terrific execution ot the diabolical scheme, when the woeworo, the conscience stricken Treshem, enlisted by his misfortunes into the divan of the conspirators, wishing to save the life of a Noble.uan who had wronged him, sent a mysterious warning, the enquiry into which led to the developement and detection of the plot.

Claude, a Postilion, who ia connected with
A BAND OF ROBBERS
That infest the forest through which they pass, breaks the carriage in which Raymond travels, as if hy accident, and betrays him to the Banditti, under pretence of finding shelter for the night. Raymond encounters a variety of adventures, and finally escapes with Agnes and her Duenna, who hare also been conducted by a treacherous guide, to this Abode of Horror, and reaches the Castle of Lindenberg unmolested ; the Baron receives him with kindness as the protector of Agnes, but being informed that he is paying his adresses to her, he instantly dismisses him from the Castle. Agnes is determined to follow his'fortune, and informs him of her intention of personating a Bleeding Nun, which is reported norturnally to peramulate the Castle wall, exactly at one o’clock, by dropping from the window this scroll;—
"When the Castle Bell tolls One, ' ‘‘Expect me as the Bleeding Nun"
Delighted with this information, he punctually attends, and as the clock strikes one, the Spectre of a Nun, with a lamp in ene hand and a dagger in the other, appears. Raymond supposing it to be Agnes, follows and attempts to embrace It, it vanishes, and in its room apptara this inscription ;	‘ Protect the child of the murdered Agnes." Aitnes not meeting with Raymond, sets out in search of him, and falls a
second time into the hands of the Banditti, but is happily rescued by Raymond’s timely interferancs ; and this interesting Piece conclude» with their offering of thankfulness and Gratitude to that Providence which never fails to punish vice and reward virtue,

ON MONDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 30, 1829,
Will be acted an interesting Mclo-drama, called THE
Cornish Miners
The immense success of this piece in London solely rested On its merits; it required no aid from the public prints to puff it into notoriety• it came at once before^ the world, replete with pathos and humour, and at once received unanimous ami unqualified approbation. The serious action of ' the " Cornish Miners" turns on the luve of Stephen Kynan and Ann Oswald, and the misfortunes of the Munhc Gilhian, to w hich the comic scenes of Bobby Redruth and Sal Ammon form an admirable relief ; the honest bhintiiess of Hugh Kynan, and the light-heariedness of Trevallion, gives a finish to the picture. The devotedness of Ann Oswald, who. in the habit of a miner, descends into the mine to save her lover from impending destruction, only yields in interest to the sorrows of poor Gilhian. who while at work at the foot of the shaft, beholds his only child dashed to pieces at his feet, at that horrid sight reaaoit leaves him for ever; lie digs a grave in the mine, and there buries Iris heart’s idol; lie is never more known to see the sttrfac of the earth, and at last perishes in the mine, by the rising of the waters.

VIRGINIUS:
Or, The Roman Father.
Till" Tragedy of Vergintia is founded upon a well-known faet in the Roman History, w hich look place during the Decemvirate of Appiu. Claudius and his Colleagues, in the 304th year from the founding of that. City, and 449 years previous to the commencement of the Christian AEra. The fitness of the story for Dramatic Exhibition has long been admitted by the Critics, and several Authors have attempted to found their claim to merited praise by adopting it Plot so suitable in every view for the Tragic Muse. Ambition to excel does not always communicate the necessary requisites to its possessor ; their works hate sunk into oblivion. It remained for Mr Knowles, (the Author ol this Play) tu prove that the comingled feelings of the Roman and the Fattier were capable of receiving the highest pathos from the sweetuess ot poetry and the beauty of action. This is allowed to be our best modern Tragedy, and its unequalled Snreess proves that a Rritish Audienre are not insensible to llie Works of troe Genius. This Play was performed a very short time back by Hie Scholars of the respectable Seminary at Hepun, which is another Proof of its Merit, being selected as a Classical F.xbibition by the first Academy ill that part of the Kingdom,

The Plot of the IDIOT WITNESS is founded on fact; and so skilful has the author been in the adaptation of the historical incidents, that a Piece possessing at once such an intense interest in its tragic parts, and such a spirit of genuine humour in its comic scenes, has never before been witnessed on a British Stage.—Michael Arnaud treacherously gains 'the affections of Adela, the beauteous wife of his friend, the gallant Earl of Sussex ; and as he “ who has once fallen will fall again,” he ends his villainy by	_
THE MURDER OF HIS FRIEND!
The horrid deed was witnessed by Gilbert, who is seized by Arnaud and Gerthold, and confined for years in a dismal
dungeon ; from which he is only suffered to be freed
BY ASSUMING THE MANNERS OF AN IDIOT.
Arnaud is left guardian to the son of the murdered Sussex, whom he seeks to destroy, that he may enjoy his wealth. He enters his bed-chamber and gives the fatal blow, when he discovers that instead of Walter Arlington, he has
STABBED HI3 OWN SON!!
Driven to despair, he accuses Walter of the murder, who is saved by the evidence of the IDIOT WITNESS.

VioletteSt. Angeville....Miss THOMPSON.
Amy Cassonette..........Miss DOBBS.	| Madame Lantone.........Mrs. THOMPSON.
The story on which this Drama is founded possesses peculiar claims on the sympathy and approbation of the public. The Count St. Angeville being lef* guardifin to the young and interesting Amy Cassonette, involves her fortune by a career of dissipation and extravagance; the hand of his son Victor is destined for Amy, but her affections having been given to Count Hosenford, St. Anseville to avoid public disgrace, resolves on tbe
MURDER OF THE INNOCENT AMT !
to effect which he employs the Savage of the Rock. Providentially. Amy and Violctte having exchanged bed chambers, the dagger of the assassin is directed to the bosom of 8t. Angeville’s daughter Violette, instead of the proposed victim. St. Angevelle overwhelmed by remorse, is on the point of discovering himsell to the Magistrates in pursuitof the Forest Savage, who has elFected his escape with his supposed victim, when
Victor, to save his Father, avows himself the Criminal! !
The Father and Son are confined in a chamber of the Castle, but are released bv the aid of Von Franc. The Forest Savage, bearing the insensibleVio-lette, takes refuge amid the rocks of La Charbonnierre; Count Uoscnford seeks shelter in the same Cave.
A Terrific Combat between Rosenford & the Forest Savage
Is followed by the discovery that Violette’s life has been preserved; the Count is cleared of all suspicion, and an excellent moral is inculcated,—that of bending in human resignation to the power whose protecting arm is always extended to reward the innocent, and visit with punishment the guilty.

A BAND OF ROBBERS
*hat infeat a Forest through which they pass, breaks the carriage in which Raymond travels, as if by accident, and betrays him to the Banditti.'undrr pretence #f finding him shelter for the night. Raymond encounters a variety of adventures, and finally escapes with Agnes and her Dueana, who have also been conducted by a treacherous guide to this
ABODE OF HORROR,
and reaches the Castle of Lindenberg unmolested. The Baron receives him with kindness a.i the protector of Agnes, but being informed that be is paying his addresses to her, lie instantly dismisses him from the Castle, Agnes is determined to follow his fortune, and informs him of her intention of personating the Bleeding Nun, which is reported noctumally to preambulate the Castle Walls, exactly at one o’clock, by dropping from the window this seroll-	•
“ When the Castle Bell tolls One, | Expect me like.the Bleeding Nun”
Delighted with this information, he punctually attends, and as the clock strikes ONE, the spectre of a Nun, with a lamp in one hand and a dagger in the other appears. Raymond, supposing it to be Agnes, follows and attempts to embrace it, it vanishes, and in its room appears this inscription,
“ Protect the Child of the Murdered Agnes.”
Agpcs not meeting with Raymond, sets out in search of him and falls a second time into the hands of the Banditti, but is happily rescued by Raymond's timely interference, and this interesting piece concludes with their offering of thankfulness and gratitude to that Providence, which »ever fails to punish Vice and reward Virtue.

The Story of this Piece is simple and interesting; Judith of Bohemia, Queen of Sarmatia, having given birth to a Blind Infant, the bitter disappointment her husband experienced, inspired her with the design of deceiving him by
A SUPPOSED MIRACLE!
The Palatine of Hava, having a Son, the same age as her’s, it was reported dead, and received by the Queen as her own ; to prevent discovery, she depute, j an officer of her household to offer Five Hundred Pieces of Gold to him who would take charge of her Child, and remove him at least 30 miles from the Court: her command were obeyed,
THE CHILD WAS RECEIVED BY OBERTO,
An old soldier, and by him brought up as his Son ; Rodolph the supposed Prince returning from the Chase, stays at the Farm of Oberto for refreshment j—Edmund is recognized by Kalig, who gives Oberto
A Sealed Packet,
In which he is solemnly conjured by the dying Queen, to divulge the truth, he immediately determines on going to Warsaw, and through tile interest of Kalig, to show the contents of the paper to the King; he succeeds, and Edmund is acknowledged by Stanislaus, as his Son, but Rudolph influenced by jealousy and revenge, determines on	.
ASSASSINATING EDMUND,
For which purpose he employs Kalig and Starrow. The Prince is about to be plunged into the Waves of the Vistula, when Kalig interposes, and in his defence fights a TdTlflC Combat with Starrow. whom he overcomes—lie is, notwithstanding, about to be punished for the very crime he prevented, when the justice of Providence is most conspicuously employed, in bringing to light the contriver of the crime, by means of a ring given to Rodolph by the King.—The Piece concludes with
THE! UNION OF EDMUND AND ELVINA,
And the Restoration of the Lawful Prince to the THRONE OP SARJWATIA.

Gun Fawkes
%^0r, The Gunpowder Plot.
** I know no reason that gunpowder treason should ever be forgot,”—Old English Ballad.
Every leading incident in the annals of a country which carries in its consequence the well-being of its Constitution, forms an epoch—-the celebration of which, when restrained within the bounds of decorum, holds up the memory of dangers past, and leads the mind to gaze with reverential awe and heartfelt thanksgiving to that Protecting Hand by which those perils where averted. It was during the Augustan reign of James the First, that Spain, still writhing under the chastisement inflicted on her arrogance aud presumptions aggressions by our peerless Elisabeth, took advantage of the inflamed minds of sundry mat-contents in England, and sent over a desperado of the name of Guido, or Guy Fawkes ; whom she had singled out as a lit member of Iheir secret councils. By his instigation the celebrated Gunpowder Plot was conceived and planned. The whole Royal family of England, the flower of her Nobility, and the heads of her first Farailes. were doomed to be sacrificed by one dreadful explosion. The hour was fixed when the King and his whole Parliament were asscmbled,#nought remained but the terrific execution of the diabolical scheme, when the woe-worn, the conscience-stricken Tresham, enlisted by his misfortunes into the divan of the conspirators, wishing to save the life of a Nobleman who had wronged him, sent a mysterious warning, the inquiry into which led to the developement and detection of the plot,—Guido Fawkes was condemned to the death he merited, and the traitors, driven to their last retreat, perished by an eiplosion similar to that by which they had hoped to hurl distruction on their country*

ON WEDNESDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 7th, 1835,
Will be performed a Tragedy by Shakspeare. revised and adapted by J. P. Kemble, and acted in Drury-Iane and Covent-garden, with
enthusiastic applause and approbation, entitled
Amongst the numerous and numberless beauties of the immortal Shakspeare, none rank so pre-eminently high as this sublime Tragedy. The awful and impressive meeting of Hamlet with the Ghost of his Father—his determination to obey his injunctions— his advice to the Actors—his Soliloquy on Death, “ To be, or not to be,” fkc—the sublimity of the language in tha Closet Scene, where the Ghost, appears a second time to warn Hamlet of his first request, to
“ Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive * Against thy mother aught.”—
The Madness of Ophelia; and, in the filth Act, Hamlet's Discussion in the Church yard over fhe grave of Yorick.
“ Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to Clay,	j	O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away ;	|	Should patch a wall t’ expel the winter's flaw.”
In the last Scene, the encounter of Hamlet with and Laertes—the death of the treacherous King—and the final close of the mortal career of the unfortunate Prince of Denmark, with numeious other beauties, render this play the first of all Dramatic enjoyments.

The immense success of this Piece in London solely rested o i its merits; it required no aid from the public prints to puff it into notoriety; it came at once before the world, replete with pathos and humour, and at once received unanimous and unqualified approbation. The senoos action of the “ Cornish Miners" (unis on the love of Stephen Kynan and Ann Oswald, and the misfortunes of the Maniac Githian to to which tile comic scenes of Bobbv Redruth and Sal Ammon, form an admirable relief, the holiest blunt ness of Hugh Kynan, and the ligbt-heartediies» of Trevallion, gives a finish to the picture The devotedness of Ann Oswald, who, in tile habit of a miner, descends into the mine to save her lover from impending destruction, only yields in interest to the sorrows of poor Githian, who while at work at the foot of the shaft, beholds his only child dashed to pieces at his feet, at that horrid sight, reason leave* biin tor ever ; he digs a grave in the mine, and there buries his heart's idol • he is never lever more known to sec the surface of the earth, and at last perishes in the mine, by the rising of the waters

The story of this Drama is deeply interesting, and the plot is conducted and developed with a considerable portion of dramatic skill. That deeds of darkness have been repealed aiid punished by the intervention of supernatural agency was a prevalent notion from the earliest ages, and has probably not been wholly without its me in society. The assasin’s arm mav have been arrested by a superstitious dread, for men, reckless of the vengeance of Heaven, start with horror from earthly retribution ; but to enter here into a description of the Piece would he to anticipate the pleasure derived from its representation.

To conclude with Lord Byron's Grand Romuntic Drama, not acted here for many years, with new Scenery, Dreuee,
and Decorations, entitled
Tin» celebrsted »nd extrsordinary Drama is founded on Ihe well-known Tale of Lord Bvroo, embodying one of the most wild and frightful superatitens •( the darker ages. The Vampires are supposed to be Evil Spirits, permited to roam about the Earth in a mortal shape, with supernatural powers of fascination, so long aa they sacrifice yearly, before the setting of the last Moon in every year, a young Female, whom they must previously marry, and whose blood ia necessary to rap. port their existence, The Moon is supposed to have strange influence over these terrific creatures; if slain by a mortal hand, and their corpses are so placed as to catch ths first tieains of the Moon when it rises, they become re-animated, and again appear in their human character. Their fatal charter is utterly lost, if through any delay the appointed Moon sinks into the Ocean before the Vampire has sacrificed his victim. This piece was originally produced in Paris, where its effect upon the audience was electrical! It has since been transformed to the London stage, with success equally decided and triumphant

»IV MONDAY EveuiusfocTOBER 80th, 18.»,
Will be presented Shakespeare’s celebrated Play, called
HENRY IV
Or, The Humours of Sir John Talstaff.
t This Tragedy is. and ever will be, very popular. Ii comprises all the public occurrences of a most eventful period of English History. The historical incidents are in themselves sufficiently numerous and interesting to engage attention without adventitious aid; but the exquisite humour of Falstaff, breaking in as it does to eonnect and accelerate, rather than to impede the progress of the story, is contrasted with such boldness and propriety, asAo make the various beauties of each appear not only conspicuous but perfectly consistent. The character ot Falstaff is.one ol the greatest originals ever drawn by the pen of even Shakspeare King Henry the Fourth may express from his throne his sovreign displeasure against his barons, and rebellious mibjects ; Hotspur may defy the royal displeasure, gallantly meet his adversary, and welcome death; Prince Henry may belong to a community of footpads, rob pious pilgrims at Gadshill, or join in humours and jollities at the Boar's-head in Eastcheap ; he may even become the greatest hero and conqueror of his time : all these things come to pass in this play.-—and yet, FalstaiT, the cowardly, the lying, the gormandizing Falstafl, is the hero of the piece. He is the hero, not so much by the indulgence of his most vicious propensities, certainly, it by his exquisite humour, which is unequalled in any other character on the English or any Foreign stage,

The story of this Piece is simple and interesting ; Judith of Bohemia. Queen of Sarmatia, having given birth to a blind Infant, the bitter disappointment her husband experienced, inspired her with the guiltv design of deceiving him by A SUPPOSED MIRACLE I The Palatine of Rava, having a Son, the same age as hers, it was reporten dead, and received by the Queen as her own, to prevent discovery, she deputed an officer of her Household, to offer Five Hundred Pieces of Gold to him who would take charge of her child, and remove him at least 30 Miles from the Court; her commands were obeyed, THE CHILD WAS RECEIVED BY OBERTO ! an old Soldier, and by him brought up as his Son ; Rodolph, the supposed Prince, returning from the Chase, stops at the Farm of Oberto for refreshment;—Edmuud is recognized by Kalig, who gives Oberto A SEALED PACKET, in which ne is solemnly conjured by the dying Queen, to divulge the truth, he immediately determines on going to Warsaw, and through the interest of Kalig, to show the contents of the Paper to the King, he succeeds, and Edmund is acknowledged by Stanislaus as his Son ; but liodolph, influenced by Jealousy and Revenge, determines on ASSASSINATING EDMUND ! lor which purpose he employs Kalig and Starrow The Prince is about to be plunged into the WAVES OF THE VISTULA, when Kalig interposes, and in his defence fights A TERRI FI^ COMBAT with Starrow, whom he overco .eg—he is notwithstanding about to bo punjshcd for tbe very crime he prevented 5 hx.a the justice of Providence is most conspicuously employed, in bringing to light the coutriver of the crime, by means of a Ring given to Rodolph by the King.—1 lie Piece concludes with the
Union of Edmund and Elvina,
AND THE RESTORATION OF THE LAWFUL PRINCE TO
THE THRONE OF SARMATIA.

On Monday Evening, September 27th, 1841,
Will be acted the celebrated Tragedy, written by the most popular Author of the dav, J. S. Knowles, Esq. entitled
mum
OR. THE ROMAN FATHER.
The Tragedy of Virginius is founded upon a well known fact in the Roman History, which took place during the Decemvirate of Appius Claudius and his Colleagues, in the 304th year from the founding of that City, and 449 years previous to the commencement of the Christian Æra. The fitness of the story for Dramatic Exhibition has long been admitted by the Critic, and several Authors have attempted to found their ' claim to merited praise by adopting a Plot so suitable in every view for the Tragic Muse. Ambition to excel does not always communicate the necessary requisites to its possessor : their works have sunk into oblivion. It remained for MR. KNOWLES (the Author of this Play) to prove that the co-mingled feelings of the Roman and the Father were capable of receiving the highest pathos from the sweetness of poetry and the beauty of action. This is allowed to be our best modern Tragedy, and its unequalled success proves that a British audience arc not insensible to the works of true Genius.
