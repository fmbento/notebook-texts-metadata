Gitlathee (ov leiStatur (fill s'anime) MLLE. GRIFFITH.
11 n'y a point 14 d'ame ni de vie; ce n'est que de la
p'erre. Je ne ferai jamais rien de tout cela.
O men genie, oil es-tu ? Mon talent, qu' es-tu devenu ?
Tout mon feu s'est eteint, mon imagination s'esl glacee, le
marbre sort froid de mes mains.
Pygmalion, ne fais plus des dieux: tu n'es qu'on vulgftire
artiste.—Vils instrument, qui n'etes plus eeux de ma gloire,
allez, ne desbonorez point mes mains!
Que suis-je devenu? Quelle etrange revolution s'est
faite en moi ?
Tyr, vide opuieoto P» mperbe, les monumens des arts
dont tu brilies ne m'attirent plus; j'ai perdu le gout que
je prenais a les admirer: le commerce des artistes et des
philosophes me devient insipide; l'entretien des peintres
et des poetes est sans attraits pour moi: la louange et la
gloire n'6l4vent plus mon ame; les eloges de ceux qui en
recevront de la posterite ne me touchent plusj l'amitie
mime a perdu pour moi ses charmes.
Et vous, jeunes objets, chefs d'oeuvre de la nature que
mon art osait imiter,et sur les pasdesqucls les plaisirs m'attjlraient sans cesse, vous, mes charmans modeles, qui m'embrasiez 4 la fois des feux de 1'amour et du genie! depuis
que je vous ai surpasses, vous m'etes tous indifferens.
ftetenu dans cet atelier par un charme inconcevable, je
»'y sais rien faire, et je ne puis m'en eloigner. J'errede
jrroupe en groupe, de figure en figure: mon ciseau faible,
incortain, ne reconnait plus son guide: ces ouvrages gros»icrs rentes A leur timide ebauche ne sentent plus la main
qui jadis les eat animes.
C'en est fait, e'en est fait; j'ai perdu mon genie—si
jeuno encore, je survis a mon talent!
Mais quelle est done eetteardeur intorne qui me devore?
qu'ai-je en moi qui semble m'embraser f quoi! dans la Iangeur d'un genie eteint, sent-on ces emotions, sent-on ces
elans des passions impclueuses, cette inquietude insurmontable, cette agitation secrete qui me tourmente, et dont je
ne puis demeler la cause?
J'ai craint que 1'admiration de mon propre ouvrage ne
causal la distraction que j'apportais ft mes travaux : je l'ai
cache sous ce voile—mes profanes mains ont os6 eouvrir
ce monument dc leur gloire. Depuis que je ne le vois
plus, je suis plus triste, et ne snis pas plus attentif.
Qu'il va m'fetre cher, qu'il va m'fitre precieux, cet immortel ouvrage! Quand mon esprit eteint ne produira
plus rien de grand, de bean, de digne de moi, je montrerai
ma Galathee, et je dirai: Voila mon ouvrage. O ma
Galathee I quand j'aurai tout perdu, tu me resteras, et je
serai console.
Mais pourquoi la cacher ? Qu'est-ce qui j'y gagne? Re'duit & roisivete\, pourquoi m'oter le plaisir de contempler
la plus belle de mes oauvres?—PeuMtre y reste-t-il quelque detain que je n'ai pas remarque1; peut-etre pourrai-je
encore ajouter quelque ornetnent k la parure; aucunc
grtce imaginable ne doit manquer & un objet si charmant
—puetstre cet objet ranimera-t-il mon imagination langmssante. II la faut revoir, l'exaninier de nonveau. Que

jusqu'ici que l'admirer.

There is no soul nor animation there; it is but stone.
To instil life into that senseless mass is beyond my power.
Where art thou, my "genius ? My talent, whither art thou
fled ? The whole fire of my imagination is extinguished; my
efforts are ice-bound, and the marble escapes cold and lifeless from my touch. Pygmalion, attempt no more to fashion
Gods: thou art but an unskilful workman.—Vile tools, ye
are no longer instruments of my glory—away, disgrace not
my hands.
What am I become? How changed are my ideas—Tyre,
proud Queen of cities, thy majesty and grandeur, thy monuments of art no longer claim my admiration. I have
IM nil taste. The intercourse with learning and her sons
to which my mind so loudly clung, is now insipid; the
charms of poetry on which my fancy loved to «-loat, have
faded; ambition and the thirst of glory no longer n><? my
soul, not even praise from them whose name shall reach
times distant goal can warm me, and friendship's silken ties
are now grown irksome.
And JOUJ.fair.objects, matchless works of nature that
my art dared'to'imitate, and in whose train pleasure ever
found me a constant attendant, you bright models that
kindled at the same time in my breast the spark of genius
and of love, since I have excelled you, my heart no longer
owns your sway
Spell bound, I cannot quit the scene of all my former
hopes, and yet I hale and loath the spot. I wander from
group to group, from form to form. My weak and erring
chisel obeys not its guide. These rough works, left faintly
formed, are now neglected by the hand that once had
power to bid them mimic life.
My sun has set; I have lost my genius. Oh! cruel
thought! so young and yet outlive my talent!—But, what
can be this fire within that preys upon my vitals? can expiring genius feel such emotions ? is it subject to these
bursts of passion, to this uneasiness and secret agitation,
for which I can assign no cause.
I feared lest admiration for my own performance might
estrange too much my attention. 1 have concealed it behind this curtain. My profane hands have dared to hide
the monument of their glory. Since I cease to gaze upon
it I am more than sorrowful ever, but not less absent.
Of what inestimable value, how precious in my sight
will be this immortal work! when my blighted genius
shall no more produce a statue worthy of my name, 1 will
point to Galatea, and will sayithere—Behold my work!—
O my Galatea, when all is gone, in having thee I still
shall hold the balm of consolation.
But why conceal her} what gain I by it? redueed to
idleness, why deprive myself of the pleasnre of contemplating the fairest of my works—Perhaps some slight defect
remains which has escaped my observation, some improvement may perhaps be made to the drapery: no imaginary
grace ought to be wanting to so fair a form. The sight of
Galatea may rouse my drooping hopes. I most once more
behold her; once more examine my work: what do 1
say? I have never examined it. hitherto I have but admired it.

toi qui formas par ma main ces charmes et ces traits qui n'attendent que le sentiment et la vie; donne-lui la moitiS de
la mienne, donne-lui tout, s'il le faut, il me sufflra de vivre
en elle. O toi, qui daignes sourire aux hommages des mortels! ce qui ne sent rien, ne t'houore pas: Stends ta gloire
avec tes oeuvres; Deesse de la beautS, epargne cet affront
a la Nature, qu'un si parfnit modele soit 1'image de ce qui
n'est pas.

Je reprends mes sens. Quel calme inattendn! quel
courage incspe're' me ranime ! une fievre mortelle embrasait mon sang ; un baume de conllance et d'espoir court
dans mes veines ; je crois me sentir renaitre.
Ainsi le sentiment de notre dependence sert quelquefois
V
| notre consolation. Quelque malheureux que soient les
mortels, quand ils ontinvoquA les dieux, ils sont plus tranquilles—
Mais cctte injuste conflance trompe ceux qui font des
vceux insenses. Helas! en l'etat ou. je suis, on invoque
tout, et rien ne nous ecoute: l'espoir qui nous abuse est
plus inserts*; que le desir.
Honteux de tant degaremens, je n'ose plus mGme en
contempler la cause. Quand je veux lever les yeux sur
cet objet fatal, je sens un nouveau trouble, une palpitation
me suffoque, une secrete frayeur m'arrete.—Eh ! regarde,
malheureux; deviens intrepide; ose fixer une statue.
Qu'ai-je vu ? Dieux I qu'ai-je cru voir? le coloris des
chairs, un feu dans les yeux, des mouvemens meme—ce
n'Stait pas assez d'esperer le prodige ; pour comble de misere enlin, je l'ai vu. Infortune', e'en est done fait—ton

(GIVEN GRATIS).

not evident to sense but felt, felt by the heart! soul of the
universe, great principle, whence emanates all that exists ;
thou who by thy ministering angel love, lullest the jarring
elements with harmony's soft spirit and animatest torpid
nature—giving to the sons of clay bright life; to bodies
soul, and form to all creation—Sacred fire! heavenly Venus! by whom all live and are renewed! where is thy
antidote? where is thy power that extends to all? where
is the law of nature that would check the throb that thunders in my brain ? where is the vivifying heat in that cold
object, the source of all my hopes of joy—All my fires have
found their focus in my heart; and death has laid his
chill cold hand upon tha't marble—Excess of sensibility so
wanting to that statue is gnawing my heart's core. Alas!
I look not for a miracle; it exists, and it must pass away.
Order is confused ; nature is violated ; restore to both their
laws; and do thou dispense impartially thy heavenly favors. Yes indeed, two beings fail in the consummation of
what was ordered. Share between the two the scorching
flame that consumes the one and does not animate the
other. It was thou that formedst by my hand those charms,
those features that want but life—Give to them the half
of mine, give to them the whole if needful—to live in her
will fully repay all—Oh! thou who deignest to receive
with smiles th adoration of weak mortals—He who listens
not to the hallowed voice of love does not honor thee—
Extend thy glory with thy works, O beauty's Goddess!
let not nature be so far insulted that so fair a model should
but be the image of what does not exist.
I am myself again. What unexpected calm, what unhoped for courage re-animates me. A deadly fever fired
my blood, but now the balm of consolation and of hope
thrills through my veins. I feel as if 1 had fresh life—
Thus the sense of our own weakness often proves our
consolation. Howsoever wretched man may be, let him
invoke the Gods, and he will feel his peace restored.
But this unjust assurance cheats those who offer up mad
vows; and I, alas! placed as I am, address my prayers to
all, unheard by any—Hope that deludes, is madder far
than any vain desire.
Ashamed of so much folly, I fear to contemplate the object that has caused it. Whenever I would raise my eyes
to view that form, fright chills my craven heart, and
chokes my respiration.
Come, wretched man! do look—be brave—dare to eye
a statue—
What have I seen ? great Gods! what did I fancy that I
saw—The glowing hue of flesh, light in the eyes, and
motion in the limbs.—It was not sufficient to expect a miracle to complete the load of wretchedness. I have witnessed its fulfilment. Unhappy man, thy doom is then for
ever sealed—thy madness at its height. Like thy genius
thy reason also leaves thee, regret it not Pygmalion, the
loss will help conceal thy faded glory. Thrice happy is
the man whose love is fixed upon a stone to batter life's
real scenes away, for empty dreams of fancy.
Immortal Gods! Venus! Galatea! Oh sweet illusion of
a love that springs from a disordered brain!
Galatea, I.—Pygmalion, 1.—Galatea, It is 1.
Pygmalion.—Delightful mockery that with its heavenly
music even greets my ear!—Oh never, never, quit my
senses.
Galatea.—It is I no longer.—Again it is I.
Pygmalion.—Yes, dear and lovely object; yes, great
master-piece of my hands and heart, it is, it is my Galatea,
I have bestowed upon thee all my life and soul; and live
hereafter but in thee.
