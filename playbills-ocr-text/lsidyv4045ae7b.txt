T

H E Publick is most reSpectSully inSormed, that the Accident
which happened last night in the PIT-PASSAGE oS this
T H E A T R E , aroSe entirely Srom the eagerneSs oS the croud ; and
not Srom any defect in the cuftomary mode oS admiflion.
It has
been erroneously stated in Some oS the Morning Prints that the
StaircaSe gave way ; it is evident that this Statement is groundleSs,
from the circumstance oS opening the Theatre this Evening
which would have been impracticable : as there could Hot pofllbly
be time to repair or build a ftaircaSe. T h e r f feeatre is in the
most perSect Slate of Security ; and however the accident oS lafl
night is to be deplored, it cannot, in the Slighteft degree, be
.imputed to any cauSe, but the irregularity and preifiire oS the
perSons aSlembled at the doors.
T o prevent, however, all possibility oS Such an event occurring
again ; a Bar will be fixed at the head of the Stairs, and a
Servant appointed to attend, that perSons may not , preSs down
them in crouds, but be regularly and gradually admitted,
Safety and convenience.
