Mr. LISTON addod, if possible, to his distinguised popularity, by Lis masterly delineation ef Dominie Sampson ; and Mr. SHERWIN, the new and successful Representative of Denude Dinmoni, was honoured with cucreased approval.—Under these circumstances, the Proprietor respectfully feels it

Most respectfully informs the Public, that he received at TWELVE O’CLOCK last Night,
the following Letters;
DEAR SIR,	~'	Tuesday,
It is with most extreme regret that l am forced to inform you, that my Daughter still continues in such a state as to require the attendance of Dr. Maton this Evening. He is of decided opinion that she would be seriously endangered by leaving her room for some days to come. He has ordered her a large blister, and other strong remedies, as immediately requisite for her personal safety. I cannot express how anxious she has been to perform to-morrow, and what a shock this disappointment is to her feelings.
Tam, DEAR SIR,
Yours, most respectfully,
GEO. PATON.
SIR,	Spring Gardens, March 4, 1823.
Having been requested to visit Miss PATON professionally this Evening, and having found her suffering under a very severe Cold, I have judged it necessary (though she is extremely anxious to take her part in the Oratorio to-morrow) to enjoin, that she should not leave her room at present, as I am decidedly of opinion, that she could not do so without great danger.
I am, SIR,
Your very obedient Servant,
To Charles Bochsa, Esq.	W. G. MATON.
Miss M. TREE & Miss GOODALL
