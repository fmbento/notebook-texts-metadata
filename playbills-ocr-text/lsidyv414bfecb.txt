Among the most interesting Incidents with which 'his Piece abounds, is the Arrival of Travellers at the Cottage of Baptista, who, in league with a
desperate Band, headed by his Sons, makes several attempts to accomplish the

Jtturder of Stagmond;
who is, however, informed of his danger by Marguerette, by means of a blood-stained mllow, with which she furnishes his bed; and is by her prevented ham swallowing a sleeping potion, mixed with his drink by Baptista; whom he overcomes at the moment he is about to perpetrate the
murder < f Agnes, and, assisted by Margnerette,

ACCOMPLISHES HIS DEATH,
by means of a concealed pannel, leading to a lone path through the forest; they, accompanied by Marguerette, escape the Banditti, and arrive safe
at the Castle of Lindenberg. At length, Raymond, amongst a train of adventures', in his pursuit of Agnes, encounters

THE aiPEGTBE .OTiTa
whom he discovers to be the Mother of Agnes, and to whose Spirit he swears from that moment to prot.ct her offspring. He afterwards fulfils his
oath, by rescuing her from ihc Cave of tie Robbers; whom having succeeded in overcoming, THE SHADE OF THE MURDERED AGNES
being a'ppeased, blesses the Union of the Child with her Deliverer; which terminates the Drama, forming- a striking and interesting conclusion.
