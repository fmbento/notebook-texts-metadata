M. JTTLT.IEN tegs most respectfully to annomce that Ms Concerts will commence on
MONDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1854-,
On which occasion he will have the honor of nuking Ms First Appearance in England since Ms return fron America.
M. Jlllien cannot refrain from expressing Iris gre.t gratification at being able, after an absence of nearly two years, once more to appear before tnos» kind and indulgent patrons who during so many years have extended to him their unremitting «juntenance and support. In the Prospectus of his last series of Concerts, in the year 1S52, M. J alien expressed a hope that his then projected journey nrig'ht furnish him with many materials wiich might hereafter serve to entertain bis English audiences,and he is mosthappy to have fount that those anticipations are not likely to be disappointed. During his late journey iu the Uniiet States. M. Jullien has found that while the Arts of Literature, Sculpture, and Painting, have burn well cared for in that great country, the Science of Music has also re ceived its share of encouragement and support, and has been fostered by the establishment of Musical Institutions, whichdo not yield even to those of Europe, either in the excellence of their arrangements or the magntude of their operations. In these Institutions, every advantage has been taken of the talents of that vast influx of Italian, German, French, and English Professors who constantly visit the United States ; but, at the same time, M. Jullien has found many instances of rare musied genius among native artists, while a vast amount of pure and charming melodies exist, ^ringing from sources entirely American. M. Jullien has lost no opportunity of collecting these most interesting native melodies, but, at the same time, has not failed to possess hirasdf of several truly classical works by native American composers. In fact, M. Jullien trusts tiat his anticipations of 1852 will be realised, and that bis American Tour will not only have jroved a source of profit and gratification to himself, but a means of providing some future Ente tainment for his kind and liberal Patrons in this country.

G. STAPLETON, Primer, 93, Waterloo Road,
M. JULLIVN'S CONCERT,d.
The reception accord« to M. Jullien last night, by an audience which crowded Drury-lane Theatre to the walls, was a token that he has rot been forgotten in his absence, and that his return fom the United States is c>n-Eidered by the London public as an event for congratulation and rejoicing For a very long period the concerts of M. Julliei have brilliantly inaugurated the winter musical seas®, and perhaps their hold upon the pleasure-seeking multitude of this immense metropolis was never more unanimoixlyadmitted than laBtyear, when, after an uninterrupted coirae of many seasons, they were missed for the first time. The attempts in certain quarters to supply their plat« were falures. The public, accustomed to M. Julliei, would flock t( the summons of no other'enter-prieingBpeculator. Nor wathis exclusive feeling ofconfideuce unwarranted,'since it is nere justice to assert that no other cat erer in the particular department over which he presides has at any time pnvided so attractive an entertainment at bo reasonable a price. The history of M, Jullien’s career	has ben too	often told	to	need
recapitnlation;	and it nearly	amounts to	a	plati-
tude to call attenthn to the fact that, while labouring zealously to auuse the public, by insensible degrees he began to combine instruction with amusement, until, almost unconsciously, the taste of his patrons acquired a certain degree of elevation, which has exercised no unimportant influenie on the progress of music and on the general	appreciation of	the works	of	tkoBe
masters who, without egotism,	wrote only	for the
good of that ait of which they are the brightest ornaments. ■While for a considerable time it wsb a matter of certainty that no baud in Europs could play dance-music, &c., to greater perfection than (bat annually brought together by M. Jullien, it waB onlj later in the day he succeeded in persuading even connoisseursthatthe instrumentalists under his guidance were equally expert in the execution of the grand chefdci’urres of th; orchestral composers, from Mozart and Beethoven to Webe- and Mendelssohn. A large number of players, now tin strength and sinew of our best orchestras, may be Baid ts have first gained distinction under the banner of K. Jullier, who, as a discoverer of instrumental talent, has dispayed an acuteness and quickness of apprehension rarely excdled. No matter what revolutions may have bappenedin tleinterim, at the accustomed period M. Jullien is sure to be found at the head of a first-rate orchestra. Even when the formidable opposition of the National Concerts at Ber Majesty’s Theatre threatened to overwhelm him, he cam) forward with a number of recruits, who were at one accepted as men of ability, and in a short time fairly wen a place by the Bide of the most eminent artists. It is mough to allude to MM. Lavigne (obce) and Wuille (clar net), without enumerating others. The “ old guard,” including MM. Koenig, OolHaet, &c., have never leit their stuidard, and still continue to hold positions in which they have hitherto failed to meet with worthy conpetitors. Meanwhile, a host of yonng and new talent luj been added to the ranks; and in the midst of some changes M. Jullien’s orchestra, judged by its performances of Iasi night, may challenge comparison with any that np t> the pretent time has yielded obedience to his ba.on. Of the fresh elements in the orchestra and soli department, and of the various novelties to the production of which M. Jullien has pledged himself in his amouncements, there will be due occasion to speak. Many new attractions are promised, some of which have been Ihe result of his American trip, while others bear rehtion to matters of more stirring and immediate intenst. These will be noticed as they appear, a reviev of last night’s concert, which waB most deservedly successful, being the object directly in hand. We may say, in advance, that M. Jullien was never more in his elenent, or hi3 patronB more heartily pleased with his efforts to entertain them.
On appearing in the irehestra the position and arrangement of which are muih the same as on former occasions, M. Jullien was receivel with every sort of demonstration that could mark the favour in which he stands with his countless supporters. Ore cheering and waving of hats and handkerchiefs lasted foi a considerable time, and were followed by a vociferous remand from all parts of the house for the National .Anthem, which was immediately performed by the bard with imposing effect. The fine overture composed ky Beethoven, with other incidental music, for Goethe’s tragedy of Eyrnonl, was performed with great spirit, and at once placed the quality of the orchtstra beyond a question. It is, if anything, somewhat more numerous than on the last occasion, and in its rarks are to be found, besides those abovementioned and lome entirely new and competent hands, Messrs. Baumann, Jarrett, Pratten, Howell, Cioffi, Piospere, Vogel, Alfred Mellon, De Folly, Chipp, Mori, and many other old favonr.tes. The first piece of dance music was M. Jullien’s Caledmian Quadrille with which the audience were evidently phased, especially in those places where the familiar tones of il. Koenig’s cornet-a-pistons were conspicuous. Mendelssohn’s symphony in A major was then performed entire, witl the parts repeated according to the score, and, for a wonder, was listened to with great attention and applauded loudly it the conclusion of eicli movement. We say, for a wonder since although the execution wa3 remarkable, and such nusic was well entitled to respect and admiration, a crowd si dense, so excitable, and, which was subsequently demonstrated, so inclined to be boisterous and unruly, we never remember to have seen, even at the.e essentialiy popular cmceris. After the Vahc (¡‘Adieu, ore of the most tranquil aid melodious of M. Jullien’s compositions, in which M. Koenig’s comet-playing called forth unbounded tokens of approval, and which was encored unanimously, the spirit of the mob began to declare itself.
A certain Signor Robbio, who has but small pretensions as a violinist, and certainly no claims to perform solos at M. Jullien’s concerts, made a very carious display of De Beriot’e Tremolo, a sort of parody of one of Beethoven’s most beautiful slow movements. This was followed by a sort of tempest, in which applause and hisses were mingled, the latter predominating. The British Army Quadrille, which followed, quelled the excitement for a time; the members of the “ three military bands,” as they walked totheirplaces in the orchestra, were received withdis-iingnished favour; and the respective variations of MM. Lavigne (oboe), Collinet (flageolet), Pratten (Ante), Kornig (comet), and Cioffi (trombone), were appreciated and gp. 1 plauded. But the peculiar and characteristic expedients to which M- Jollien has resorted near the end for the purpose of imitating the din and fury of battle, and the martial strain of “ See the conquering hero comes,” Eent forth by the whole oombined powers of the orchestra, raised the audience to a Btate of excitement which never wholly subsided until the end of the concert. At the conclusion of the quadrille the National Anthem was again demanded amid a veritable nproar; and this bequest complied with, “Partant pour la Syrie” was called for with even greater vehemence. The transport of enthusiasm created by the well known French melody beggars description ; nor would it be possible to portray the scene that followed. The crowd became wholly unmanageable; and had not the policemen, who werejudiciouslydispersed among the promenaders, betrayed the utmost good-humour from first to last, the consequences might have been serious indeed. These excellent public officers, however, showed no signs of auger at the unceremonious treatment to which they were incessantly exposed, and with unruffled temper used their best efforts to keep the peace. But in vain; rings were formed, benches were upset; and all the accustomed
Saturnalia of an unmanageable and unmannerly mob were rehearsed with a violence and contempt of order that set decorum at defiance, and gave the pit of Drury-lane Theatre the aspect of a bear-garden. An unfortunate member of the French band of Guides being recognized in his nniform was assailed with obtrusive and ill-directed manifestation* of goodwill. The crowd pursued him with such ardour, and every one was so eager for “ fraternization.” that but for the timely aid of a policeman, and a member of one of our English regimental bands, who took the French musician by the arm, and with desperate firmness forced a passage through the cohorts of misguided sympathizers, our excellent ally would have run the risk of being killed with kindnets. On the whole it must he admitted that the scene was not creditable to a civilized assembly, and that the patriotic feeling might with profit have found vent in a more decent and becoming manner. Throughout the whole of the second part of tl e concert the turmoil continued at short intervals. There was some attention paid to the selec’ion from Meyerbeer’s Huguenots, and to the fine solo-playing by MM. Prospere, Koenig, Baumann, Wuille, Lavigne, and Vogel, on the ophieleide, cornet, bassoon, clarionet, obce and viol d’amore; but it was impossible to judge of the merits of M. Jolhen’s new American polka, Katiy-Did, “descriptive of the various musical sounds produced by the myriads of insects on a tropical night,” which nevertheless seems to contain some novel and ingen-oua effects of instrumentation, or to pay anything like proper attention to M. 'Wuille’s masterly solo on the clarinet. The audience had lost its equilibrium, and could not be restored to good behaviour. When a new and spirited danoe,
(ctitled Moldavian SdwUmhe, was played, almost every one began to imitate that popular step; and it must be tllowed that M. Jullien’s tune was so lively and well marked that there was some excuse for this, considering the state of things in general. Signor Bobbie played, again upon the fiddle, a VaUt Diaholique, but
did not improve on close acquaintance; and the concert terminated with an enlivening galop, called The Atlantic, another of M. Jullien’s most recent inspirations, which produced an effect of association something similar to that created by the Schottivfie. These n?w dances sfeji s good
, chance of bs o ning popular, both being of the best of their kind. After the galop another deafening ciy was raised for “ Go 1 save the Queen,” and another for “ Partant pc-nr la Syrie,” which were accordingly performed in sue-cession, the audience lending the strength of their numerous voices to both of the national melcdies. M. Jullien was then summoned forward, as at the end of the first part, and vociferously cheered; and at length the audience, fairly tired out with exertion and exhausted with demonstrations of enthusiasm, gradually dispersed. It is to be hoped that the next conceit, while quite as successful, maybe somewhat more orderly. There should be reason in all things.
The theatre looks as gay and sparkling as of old; the decorations are as tasteful, and the reading-room at the extremity of the promenade is rich as usual in newspapers and serials of all kinds and in every variety of language. Nothing has been spared, in short, to make the concerts both inviting and attractive. Madame Anna Thillon and Signor Botttsini are engaged, and will shortly appear, while several new works of M. Jullien are announced, and among others the New York Fireman's Quadrille, which has been much talked of.

M. JULLIEN’S
M. JULLIEN cannot refrain iron, expressing his great gratification at being able, after an absence of nearly two years, once more to appear before those kind and indulgent jatrons, who during so long a period have extended to him their unremitting countenance and support. In the Prospectus of Ins last series of Concerts, in the year 1852, M. Jui.i.ien expressed a hope that his then projected journey might furnish him with many materials which might hereafter serve to entertain his English audiences, and he is most happy to have found that those anticipations are not likely to be dsappointed. During his late journey in the United States, M. Jullien has found that, while the Arts of Literature, Sculpture, and Painting xave been well cared for in that great country, the Science of Music has also received its share of encouragement and support, and has bem fostered by the establishment of Musical Institutions, which do not yield even to those of Europe cither in the excellence of their arrangements or the magnitude of their operations. In these Institutions every advantage has been taken of the talents of that vast influx of Lalian, German, French, and English Professors who constantly visit the United States; but, at the same time, M. Jullien has found many instances of rare musical genius among native artists, while a vast amount of pure and charming melodies exist, springing from sources entirely American. M. Jullien lias lost no opportunity of collecting these most interesting native
melodies, hut, at the same time, has not failed to possess himself of several truly classical works by native American composers. ~Jn fact, M. Jullien trusts that his anticipation! of 1852 will be realized, and that his American Tour will'not only have proved a source of profit and gratification to himself, hut a means of providing some future Entertainment for his kind and liberal patrons in this country.
During the Series of Concerts, will he performed, the following New pieces of Music ■—
THE AMERICAN QUADRILLE,
Composed on National American Melodies.
THE SLEDGE POLKA,
Descriptive of the Winter amusement of Sledging in North America.
THE KATTY »1» POLKA,

For the sun’s beaming high in the cloudless blue sky, And a true heart is waiting for thee.”

And the pale stars faintly peep,
At my window I hear the same voice, sweet ;i < < • Calling softly while mother’s »sleep:—
“ Oh ! Minnie, dear Minnie, come o'er the lea! ’* Then, without a reply, like a bird soon I fly To the heart that is waiting for me.

ANISA T BILLON.
Far down beside the green Savanna,
Far, far away,
Where all day long the Red-bird warbles, There do the kind hearts stray.
Ah ! wheresoe’er my footsteps wander, Where'er I roam,
I sigh for those from whom I’m parted— Sigh for the old friends at home.
All the world seems sad and dreary, Everywhere I roam,
Ah ! how my heart grows sad and weary, Far from the old friends at home.
There's one down by the green Savanna,
One that I love,
Ah! like some spell that dear form haunts me, No matter where I rove.
They who have none to prize them fondly, Know not the pain
That this poor heart will feel and suffer 'Till I see home again.
All the world seems sad and dreary, Everywhere I roam,
Ah! how many hearts grow sad and weary, Far from the old friends at home.

Sweet love, arise while yet the night Sheds o’er the skies yon flood of light.
Oh! see how clear shine out those stars; And hark! how near sound those guitars— Now louder yet, each pause between,
Ring castanet and mandoline:
And each cool breeze that rustling wakes, From citron trees their fragrance shakes.
Oh! come and grace yon glittering scene, Where all confess thou sliin'st a queen— Loveliest in bow’r, lightest in hall,
Spain’s fairest flower outhlooming all!
Ah, ah, ah, ah ! ah, ah, ah, ah !
Lovliest in bow’r, lightest in hall, Ah, ah, ah, ah! ah, ah, ah, ah!
Spain's fairest ftow’r outblooming all!
From Arragon, from fair Castile—
From proud Leon, from gay Seville ; Though all lhat’s bright, and young and fair, From each to-night throng dazzling thtie. What eye can flash so proud a glance ? What foot can dash so hold a dance ?
No, dearest, no ! though all combine,
Not one can show a form like thine ;
Then haste, and grace the gliit’ring scene, Where all confess thou shin’st the queen— Hark! down the stair, light tripping now,
A stc-p 1 hear—joy! joy! ’tis thou.
Ah, ah, ah, ah! ah, ah, ah, ah!
Hark! down the stair, light tripping now, Ah, ah, ah, ah ! ah, ah, ah, ah!
A step I hear—joy ! joy ! ’tis thou.

In the stillness of the night, the bells of the neighbouring villages mark the hour of Midnight—all is quiet, save the footsteps of the Sentinels. The Bivouac Fires hum brightly, and the fitful breeze of the night agitates their flames. The advance of the Russians is heard in the distance, and the alarm is sounded in the Camp. A short but fearful struggle takes place, and the enemy, though repulsed, soon obstinately returning to the charge and protected by the darkness of the night, seizes several posts, but morning dawns, and quickly the Battle, on all sides, rages with renewed fury. The English, who receive the first attack, rush forward and charge the enemy with desperate determination. The French, at a “ Pas de Course,” hound forward to join their Allies in the onward movement, and the Turks, who were at first astounded, and for a moment reeled under the impetuosity of the' attack now take part in the conflict, and one general and furious charge of (he whole line decides the fodnne of the day, and leaves the Allies masters of the field, amidst the shouts of “VICTORY!

£uST. JULLIEiTS BAL MASQUE. /¿ST?
b
The annual Bal Masqué-, which for a very long pericd lias constituted a sort of epilogue to M. Jullien’s series of winter concerts, took place last night, at Drury-lane Theatre, with more than the ordinary “ pomp and circumstance.” The decorations of the salle we shall not attempt to describe. Enough that the pit was boarded over as usual, and that the space from the centre of the dress boxes to the uttermost limits of the nether Btage formed one vast platform, to accommodate the motley group—the orchestra, of upwards of 100 first-rate performers, directed by M. Juliien himself, occupying its accustomed imposing position in the back ground. The gaseliers were as brilliant and abundant as ou any previous occasion, and the whole spectacle was well calculated to please the eye and excite the imagination of the bond fide pleasure-hunter ; while the philosopher, to whom a variety of faces are something more than a ** gallery of pictures,” and the busy sound of a multitude of voices than a “ tinkling cymbal,” found food for reflection and tbeme3 suggesting a multitude of thoughts about the vanity of mundane shows and recreations, and the extreme frivolity, not to say folly, of nine-tenths of the human race. The question to be solved, however, was which had reason on his side, the pleasure-hunter or the philosopher ; and we prefer leaving the solution to the latter, providing that he .quitted the “ gay and festive scene” at une heure convenable.
As for the actual bas masqué last night, and the costumes of characters, and the general hilarity, and the occasional hyper-hilarity—or boihterousneas, in simpler language—we have neither the desire nor the art to portray them. Balzac has done it in one of his most graphic romances, if we remember rightly, and twenty more after him. The truth ÎB, that all bals masqués are pretty nearly the same ; and the only différence between those in London and t'10 0 in PariB is, that the fun and frolic of the last are evidently spontaneous, while those of the first are forced and, consequently, 'ungenial. If we were asked for a list of the masques or costumes, we may answer that there was the semblance or caricature of everything, from Hamlet with topboots to the Turk without a fez ; and all that can possibly be imagined between the two—many good, many bad, anl most indifferent. The music, however, was delicious,—and the enlivening strains of the Katydid Bolin, the Moldavian Schcttische, the Brima, Dona Waltz, and other irrestibls and “ nunc csl saltandum” compositions of M. Jullien, performed by a spleDdid orchestra, under the propelling biton of the popular maestro himself, kept up the spirit of the dance, with unflagging energy, until I o’clock past midnight, when, in obedience to the admonition of a printed summons, placarded in front of the orchestra, nearly one-half of the donee and variegated crowd wbhdiew “to supper.” What ensued we have no means of knowing ; but, from previous experience, we have little doubt that the ball was kept up with increased animation until the approachof those smaller hours which announce that “ flecked darkness” is about to “ reel before the approach of dawn.”

hw te, M. JULLIEN’S CONCERTS. / j> ^ -
The whole of the first part of last night’s concert coa.' sisted of a selection from the works of Beethoven. The house was crammed to suffocation, and the promenade was so inconveniently packed that the well-wishers to the good cause of music began to have forebodings that all would nob go off quietly, and that the “Emperor of the Orchestra might possibly find a restless, unappreciative, and unwilling audience. But no such thing. To judge from the attentive» manner in which the music (all instrumental) was listened to, and the enthusiastic applause bestowed upon each successive piece, it was an audience of musicians, or at least oE well-informed amateurs, to whom—as high mountains to Lord Byron—fine music “was a feeling." At the same time, in justice to M. Juilien and his orchestra, we are bound to confess that we have rarely heard a more admirable sxecution of some of the very best compositions of the great: master and greater genius, to whom the first moiety of the programme was dedicated. No “Philharmonic” orchestra of my of the musical citieB of Europe could with any pains have performed them much better. The magnificent overture, Leonora (the grandest of the four to Fidelia), began the concert, and was sucoceeded by the so-called Turkish a«e* Tretta, in B flat, from the symphony No. 8. This was unanimously encored—a just compliment to the delicacy and spirit of its execution. The slow movement from the sym* phony No. 2 was equally well given, and, had it come be« fore the other, would, probably, have borne away the bell. The violin concerto in D (the first allegro), the only on® which Beethoven wrote for that instrument, was played in® masterly manner by Mr. Blagrove, who was accompanied to-perfection, Mr. Alfred Mellon, who usually directs tha 3olos, conducting. This very noble, but in no way “ ac$ captandum” music was so much liked and so warmly ap* plauded that ¡t was evident the whole of the three movements of the concerto might have been presented with a certainty of being welcome to the audience. The selection terminated with the symphony in C minor (No. 5)^ superbly played under the direction of M. Jullien^ who, in placing before his vast public so many of those works which he has been for some years gradually endeavouring to insinuate into their good graces, in. concerts devoted to music of another character, showed ® wise discretion. It served as a kind of recapitulation for the audience of what they had been listening to, from time to time, and unconsciously becoming familiar with and attached to. The whole performance was a new triumph for good music, and a new proof that, when well executed before a public inclined and accustomed to pay deference even to that! which they may not immediately understand, the productions of such gifted men as Mozart, Beethoven, and Men* debssohn, are not, any more than the plays of Shakespeare.
addressed exclusively to a few. Great credit, as we have more than once insisted, is due to M. Juilien for the good, he hasdonein this respect; and the greater since, at first: sight, it might have threatened to endanger his popularity mth certain classes among the most numerous and constant, of his supporters. H. Juilien, however, had faith in hia mission; and where there is faith, combined with per* severance, what cannot be done !
The new quadrille, or, more properly speaking, sym* phomo fantasia of M. Juilien, entitled the Allied Armies, ia very successful, and deservedly so. Just now a martial subject is the one most certain to interest the public, and anything which alludes in a frank and appropriate manner to pur latest and, it is to be hoped, for the benefit of Europe and of civilization, most enduring alliance, is sure to excite unanimous sympathy. M. Jullien’s new pieceaffects this happily ; and the composer is entitled to praise, not merely for the musical cleverness he has evinced, but for his good taste in having refrained from announcing it under one of those claptrap titles by means of which the sordid cupidity of trade has striven to make a profit out of events which, whila glorious to our arms, are too serious and sad to be foroed; into imaginary companionship with the escapades of tha ballroom or the most commonplace inoidents of social life. _ The_ Allied Armies is a battlepiece, with a be* ginning, middle, and ead; the beginning is an illustration of peace, the middle of war, the end of victory. The national melodies, or rather imitations of the national melodies of England, France, and Turkey, constitute an element of variety and contrast which, justifying the adoption of the Allied Armies, as a title to the work, presents at tha same time a legitimate medium of musical effect. The only instance of questionable taste in the whole is the illuminated circular wreath at the conclusion, in the midst of which, high above the orchestra, glitters the significant ‘Vlma.” Such a device is out of keeping with what should form the exclusive material of a popular entertainment. The united odours of the three allied nations would answer the purpose quite as well, without suggesting any emotions beyond those connected with the enjoyment de* rived from the music, and the gratification springing from its indirect allusions to the patriotic feeling and to the warm affection entertained far an alliance universally approved of and applauded. It was thus that our excellent and harmonious friends of the Imperial Regiment of Guides, raised the English enthusiasm to its highest pitch. We were charmed with their beautiful performances, and the knowledge that they were Frenchmen gave an additional zest to our appreciation. To insure our sympathies and cheers it was not necessary that they should present us* with the Sebastopol QuadnllCf the A.lma Galop t or any other impertinent and irreverend reminder of the grave and important occurrences upon which the eyes and hearts of the two great nations are now intently fixed. We have noother objection to urge against the Allied Armies Quadrille, which is a capital thing of its kind, and indeed one of th© most effective M. Juilien has produced. The introduction, illustrative of the _ time of peace, is picturesque and ably written ; and the interruption of the peasants’ orisons by the shrill sound of the trumpet announcing the coming, change, is happily conceived. Thedas redouble otike French, with the duet “ Tendres adieux,” forms the first figure, which is forcibly contrasted with strongly marked tunes that proclaim the arrival of the Irish, Scotch, and Welsh, soldiers (No. 2). The approach of the English (No. 4Y carries this out with spirit and effect; and the wild hymn of the Muezzin, followed by the characteristic Turkish wan march with drum and triangle (No. 5), completes the picture.
A long eIow movement, descriptive of “mght and the bivouac of the allied armies,” partly founded on the theme of the introduction, is the best piece of music in the whole, and shows more than ordinary fertility in orchestral combinations. The battle and the victory—in which the three military bands, French, English, and Turkish, each in the correct national uniform, alternately make themselves evident—is as full of bustle, diu, and boisterous animation, as the most fervid lover of obstreperous and military harmony could desire; and the combination of “Partant pouE la Syria” with “God save the Queen,” at the end, is ingeniously contrived, and makes an effective and stirring climax. The executiin of this fantasia, which presents! many difficulties, is worthy of M. Jullien’s orchestra; and the cheers of the audience at the termination, mix not inharmoniously with the warlike clang of brass instruments from the three military bands (Grenadiers, Life Guards, and Coldstream) and the national strains of the victorious French and English. The sensation created last night was extraordinary. The same audience that listened with such decorous Bilence to the poetical inspirations of Beethoven was uproarious in its appreciation of M. Jullien’s scenic quadrille. When the Guards, with their instruments, were seen at the back of the orchestra, there were loud cheers, which were redoubled at the appearance of thoBe who represented our French allies; and even the unhappy Turks, who appeared last of all, came ia for their share of the demonstration. The quadrille over, the national anthem, “ Partant pour la Sjrie,” and last? not least, “ Rule Britannia,” were successively called foe and greeted with vociferous and incessant cheering, waving of hats, and other manifestations of a state of excitement? rery easy to understand. The truth is, the mere sight of a soldier’s uniform appeals to the enthusiasm of aa English crowd at the present moment; and at the strains of martial music, at the sound of the trumpet, we, “ the nation of shopkeepers,” the pacific among the pacific, are beEide ourselves. Our special correspondent in the Crime®, has more than once alluded to the effect produced upon out own valiant soldiers by ihe splendid music of the French military bands ; and if the mimic counterfeit of those inspiriting strains can affect us here so vividly in our safe and comfortable home, we can readily believe what the reality must be upon those far distant, who are directly engaged in that terrible and portentous struggle upon which the freedom and happiness of the OldWorld, if notthe future destinies of this hitherto favoured country, may justly be said to depend.
Dbury-lane Theatre.—Yeaterd»y a general assembly of the proprietors of Drury-lane Theatre was held in the theatre saloon, B. B, Cabbell, M.P., in the chair, to receive a statementof accounts and elect auditors, &c., for the year ensuing. The report congratulated the proprietors upon ths unusual fact of the rent of the theatre having been punctually paid by Mr. Smith, the lessee, so that a nearly new theitre, inside and out, had been obtained for an expenditure of about 2,000f., although, owing to the decayed Btate of the timbers, the repairs had oost 30W, more than the original estimate. The quarterly payments had been duly made to the Duke of Bedford, and 6501. had also been paid to the renters’ trustees. The statement of accounts, which extended over three half-years, exhibited a total receipt of 7,0761. 18e. 10d., and a total outlay of 7,11‘Ji. 14b. 2d.

M. JULLIBN'S CONCERTS,	^
The performance on Saturday night brought to a close with éclat the most successful season M. Jullien has had since the first institution of these concerts at Drury-lane Theatre. The house was again crowded to inconvenience, and the music was listened to by a majority of the audienc3 under conditions of anything but personal comfort. The programme, which was miscellaneous, included some of the most popular of those pieces which have already been noticed. Madame Anna Thillon, who appears to have obtained a high plaça in the favour of the public, was forced to sing five times, instead of twice, so pleased were her numerous admirers with her performances. After receiving a double encore in the pleasing ballad called “ Minnie,” she was summoned again to the orchestra, and on this occasion introduced 11 Partant pour la Syrie,” to which she imparted a warmth and animation quite congenial to the sentiment of the spirited patriotic melody of the French empire. The orchestral accompaniments, supplied, we understand, by M. Thillon, were clever and appropriate. A solo on the trombone by M. Cioffi, of which the theme and two of the variations from the opening movement of Beethoven’s pianoforte sonata, Op. 26, constituted the principal features, was a really excellent performance. Of the admirable clarionet playing of M. Wuille we have more than once spoken ; but especial notice is due to M. Monasterio, a young violinist from the Brussels Conservatoire, who on several occasions during the Feason has raised the admiration of the connoisseurs. M. Monasterio, we believe, is a Spaniard, and the solo he performed on Saturday—a very ingenious fantasia on melodies in the Spanish style, bolero, seguidiUa, and whatnot-showed him in no less favourable a light as a composer than bis fluent and highly finished execution declared him already, though so young, a master of the instrument of his predilection. In short, M. Monasterio is a tyae artist, without trickery or charlatanism, who does credit to the institution in which he has received his education, and from whom the greatest things may be reasonably anticipated.
Among the achievements of the orchestra, certainly one of the finest M. Jullien has ever brought together, must be mentioned the scherzo from Mendelssohn’s Midsummer flight's Dream, which was executed with a point and delicacy cot to ba surpassed, and Herr Richard Wagner’s very singular oveiture to Tannhäuser. This last-mentioned work was introduced a year a-jo at the concerts of the New Philharmonic Society, but failed to please either the public or the critics, who in vain had been advised by the German musical transcendentalists, with Franz Liszt at their head, that it belonged to the “ music of the future,” and that Herr Wagner, its composer, was living before his time, a prophet of the ultimate destinies of the art. It is to be regretted that M. Jullien, who, with equal faith and gallantry, has persisted in regaling his patrons from, time to time with this wild and incoherent lucubration, and who, it cannot be denied, has been able to make it “ go,” as the musical term is, in spite of its almost insurmountable difficulties, with marvellous accuracy and precision, should have been no more successful than liis predecessors and co-believers at St. MartinVhall. Even the Bjnopsi?. printed in the bills, condensing Herr Wagner’s own description of that which his overture i3 intended to convey —the life of man, the approach of love, the temporary victory of sense, and the final triumph of soul—is insufficient to create in the mind of the plain and unsophisticated hearer those emotions of delight, that unbounded feeling of admiration, that thorough edification, in short, for which M. Liszt and other champions of the ** music of the future,” with Herr Wagner himself in the foreground, have contended in so many unintelligible essays, and with such a wealth of words and unconvincing eloquence. With the utmost deference for the opinion of modern Germany, we are compelled to adhere to our first opinion, that the overture to Tannh-auser îb a piece of vapid rhodomoatade, and that, as Herr Wagner paints him, “ the minstrel of love” is, after all, but a cla morous and empty personage. If the general ear of “ the future” is destined to be afflicted with such music as this, it is to be hoped that charitable posterity will institute some extra hospitals for the deaf wherever Berr Wagner and his compositions are allowed to penetrate. Some of our readers may have heard of the story of an unfortunate gentleman at Berlin, who, visited with a loss of hearmg for which no cure could he invent îd,
was advised by his doctor, as a last hope, to go to the Optra and witness the performance of Spoutini’s Olympia. A ffcir the grand ftna'e to the second act the parient turned quickly round to his medical attendant, and, with joy in his countenance, exclaimed, “ Doctor, I hear !” But alas ! what cured the patient killed the counsellor, who heeded not the words addressed to him. The doctor was deaf ; ha had taken his own medicine. We never hear the overture to Tannhäuser but this anecdote forcibly suggests itself as an illustration. The quadriile from Rossini’s sparkling and genial Comte Oy—one of M. Jullien’e best— was Tike “ any suckiDg dove” after the “ roaring” of Venus's minstrel ; and yet, M. Jullien himself is not among tboEe who are most famed for their sparing nse of instr i-menfcs of brass and percussion ; and they who, like Othello, according to the clown’s authority, “ care not greatly for a music that may be heard,” would scarcely think of applying to the energetic composer of the Allied Armies' Quadrille This, by the way, which has proved the most successful of if. Jullieu’s novelties, was received on Saturday night with the same enthusiasm- as before, and wound up, as usual, amid general cheering, with “God Bave the Queen,” “Fartant pour la Syrie,” sni “Rule Britannia,” in alternate succession. In his preliminary announcement M. Jullien promised to introduce come specimens of American composition, and we presume the melodious and extremely well written andante frum Mr. Bristow’s symphony in D minor, which was performed in a faultless mauner, and greatly admired by the audience, must be accepted as a partial redemption oi the pledge. To judge from this one movement the entire Bymphony well deserves a hearing. The concert terminated with the lively galop entitled the Charye Galop ; the band again “ struck up” our majestic National Anthem, and M. Juliien Was then unanimously summoned to receive the congratulations of the audience.	1
" It is no insignifioint sign of the continued progress of good music that the largest audience of a season so prosoerous from first to last should have been assembled on the nights devoted to Beethoven and Mendelssohn, The Beethoven night turned out so well that the programme was repeated shortly after cards, with the addition of the great pianoforte concerto in E flat, which was played, without curtailment aud in a masterly style, by M. Alexandre Billet On the Mendelssohn night the crowd was so immense that many hundreds who besieged the doors and wore clamorous for admission were compelledtobe sentaway disappointed. This Bbculd satisfy the adherents of the “ fast” school that there does exist an audience in our metropolis for music of the highest and most uncompromising character—an audience, too, independent of that which flotks to the sacred oratorios at Extier a-d St. Martin’s hills, and mure than twice as numerous— since, while in the largest of these bui'dings at jibe very utmost 2.090 persons may be accommodated, Drury-laLe Theatre can make room for somewhere about 5,000, nearly bail of whom, let it be remembered, are not conveniently seated, as at the orat >rio performances, but »finding closely pack d together, at the greatest personal inconvenience • and yet they listen with as much attention for the greater" part as the most exclusive connoisseurs of the Philharmonic genua, and will not tolerate, if they can help it, any noise or disburbance during the performance of the music. M. J-allien has wisely eschewed that arrogant and conceited policy which induces some entrepreneurs to look down upon the public as something that must be conciliated by petty and undignified concessions. On the contrary, he has looked up to his patrons with respect, aud, while doing his best to amuse them, has had sufficient good Bimseto know and believe that nothing which he was himself able to comprehend and venerate could be above the intelligence of the crowd, when presented in moderation and at suitable times and occasions. To this he owes one-half of his success; and, while he has almost entitled himself in this country to the epithet which M. Jules -Janinso graphically applied to Alexandre Dumas, of “ le arand amvscur public" he may be consoled wi’h the reflection that he has done something tor his art, and that the part he has been able to take iu promoting a healthy taste for music amoDg the great masses has been anything but contemptible. It is for these reasons that a greater degree of consideration has been given to his concerts than might under other circumstances have been bestowed.

Introduction.—TIME OF PEACE—Tlie Dances and Songs of the Inhabitants of a Village are heaul, and towards the eh.sc of day, the Hymn of the Peasants, returning thanks to Heaven for the blessings of Peace, is wafted through the valley. Suddenly the Truuflt of Ditcoitn sounds in the East, and tills the valley with its harsh reverberations.

No. 5.—NIGHT.—BIVOUAC OF THE ALLIED ARMIES. During the slumbers of the weary Soldiers, their dreams are supposed to wander towards their distant fatherland, and the prayers for their safely, offered up by their friends at home, seem to hover about them. In the stillness of the night, the bells of the neighbouring villages mark the hour of Midnight—all is quiet, save the footsteps of the Sentinels. The Bivouac Fires hum brightly, and the fitful breeze of the night agitates their flames. The advance of the Russians is heard in the distance, and the alarm is sounded in the Camp. A short but fearful struggle takes place, and the enemy, though repulsed, soon obstinately returning to the eharge and protected by the darkness of the night, seizes several posts, but morning dawns, and quickly the Battle, on all sides, rages with renewed fury. The English, who receive the first attack, rush forward and charge the enemy with desperate determination. The French, at a “ Pas de Course," bound forw ard to join their Allies in the onw ard movement, and the Turks, who were at first astounded, and for a moment reeled under the impetuosity of the attack,’ now take part in the conflict, and one genera) and furious charge of the whole line decides the fortune of the day, and leaves the Allies masters of the field, amidst the shouts of “VICTORY!"

When the sun is high in the bright blue sl y,
And the so it wind sighs through the grove,
’Mid the fragrance of flow ers and the green spreading bowers, A sweet voice oft invites me to rove:—
“ Ok! Minnie, dear Minnie, come o'er the lea,
For the sun’s beaming high in the cloudless blue sky, And a true heart is waiting for thee.”
In llsc silent night, wlun the moon shines bright,
And the pale flats faintly peep,
At my window I hear the same voice, sweet and clear, Calling softly while mother's asleep:—
“ Oh! Minnie, dear Minnie, come o'er the lea!” Then, without a reply, like a bird soon I fly To the heart that is waiting for me.

VBRISTMA « PANTOMIMES, £c.
DBJJRY-LANE THEATRE.
To have witnessed the holjdav-making crowd which Yhronged last night the precincts of Old Drury, one would have thought that tlhe heart of England, whose pulse may be Baid to beat in this huge and overgrown metropolis of London, was intent, on nothing but fun and frolic, could throb to nothing butt the mimic gibe, see nothing but the clown’s grimace, applaud nothing but the evolutions of the nimble harlequin, sympathize with nothing but the misfortunes of poor battered pantaloon, chuckle at nothing but the successful wiles of grotesque buffoons and rogues when exercised at the cost of the more simple •nd matter-of-fact scions of humanity. The truth is, that pantomime belongs to all times and circumstances ; that, whatever may be the condition of things, there must be element for laughter in the deeds and appearances both of ourselves and our neighbours, and, in Bhort, that it is not in the “ humane” creature to reach that standard at which all its “fails ct gesteé’ (as the old french chroniclers and romancista say) are above reproach, and consequently unexpoBed to ridicule—or, as the ironical among poets term it, “wholesome satire.” And thus, we gentlemen and plebeians of united Britain, although the actual moment is possibly one upon which hangs cnr future destiny as a political Power, if not absolutely as a nation, can afford to laugh when seemingly it would far better befit ns to weep, or at least to hold our breath with anxious suspense rather than onr sides with overcoming fits of hilarity. But so it is; and so will it be, in all likelihood, when the hand that pens these lines has withered, and the existing generation liaB passed away. True, the history of Italia’s bondage will have to be written in the same chapter with that of its carnival; and if they who for so many luatrea have cherished no hope of independence may he allowed to put on the mask and grin with pasteboard merriment, why should not we, who have lost no aspiration, and who “ never will be slaveB,” laugh with what Shelley calls that “inextinguishable laughter” which is the birthright of the free-hearted and the prerogative of the brave and unsubdued, the invincible in spirit and therefore unconquerable in body ? This may be politics ;—what then ? Is not politics at the present moment mixed up with all our thoughts ? Can an Englishman—a true Englishman—take a cup of tea or coffee without thinking of Sebastopol, or swallow a glass of grog without an inward vow for the speedy annihilation of the Czar and his legions of serfs ; or puff a cigar without symbolizing in the cloud of smoke what, in his heart of hearts, he ardently desires may be the end and consummation of Bussian insolence and pride ? He cannot; and for this reason we make no apology for alluding to the all-engrossing topic even while our task is the very humble one of recounting the success or failure of a Christmas pantomime. The performances last night began with that grim, utterly threadbare, and domestic tragedy, George Barnwell, the delight of our fathers, and the
despair of every dramatist (except the author of Jane Shore), whose ambition has been to produce a lever de rideau for “ boxing night.” Of this great work, and of its performance, we shall say nothing, but that it was acted noisily, and found a noisy audience. The pantomime was the absorbing idea, not only with the “ gods,” but with those ■who, being lees than the “ gods,” pay more—the occupants of the pit and boxes. The Binfulcareerand too late repentance of the familiar apprentice were equally uncared for; while the poetical meritB of the play paEsed off unnoticed by the crowd, which was in no poetical humour; and in whose
£resence, indeed, the dying swan might have chanted its ist strains to inattentive and indifferent ears. At length the wished-for moment oame. A “ medley” overture, hot from the brain of the exhaustless Mr. J. H. Tully—who, iu the absence of a National Opera, has so long devoted his energies to the compilation of tunes for pantomime and melodrama—raised the enthusiasm of the bouse. It was not exactly the beauty of the music, however, that created this sensation, nor the excellence of Mr. Smith’s orchestra, which could easily be made more formidable in numbers and in strength, but the English National Anthem, and the French “ Partant pour la Syrie,” seasonably introduced towards the end of the overture, which awakened the energy of the British Lion, and were encored with acclamations. The orchestral prelude over, the curtain was raised, to thegeneral delight, upon the first scene, or tableau, of Jack and GiU, the “ new and entirely original and extraordinary and fantastic and culinary,” and what not else, ChristmaB pantomime, which the enterprising Mr. E. T. Smith had been for some weeks preparing for his countless friends and patrons. The tableau, representing the abode of Hypochondria in the kingdom of Dulness, at once arrested notice and commanded silence.
The name of the pantomime—which we have already half disclosed—is in foil, Jack and GiU (or Jill), Harlequin King Mustard, and the Four and Twenty Blackbirds baked in a Pie .—a long name, and of infinite promise to all those who are not too old to rembember, or not too young to read, the time-honoured ditty of “Sing a song of sixpence.” This infinite promise, we feel bound to say, is more than infinitely (pasB the phrase) jiei formed— so performed, indeed, that the cherished nursery-rhyme becomes perplexed and smothered in a dream of faery-land so singular and inconsequent that not only does the “ song of sixpence” vanish into a myth, but the received notions about fairies and genii all over the world are violently upset. It haB long remained an article of faith among those who believe in the supernatural, that spirits, even those which vex the earth, are unable or uninclined to eat and drink—ill short, that they are not blessed or cursed with mortal appetites. Mr. E. L. Blanchard, the imaginative and bay-crowned inventor of the present harlequinade, has not, it is true, violated the established belief about goblins so as to endow them with the “ earthy ” faculties of thirst and hunger; he doeB not cause his spirits to eat and drink, but he travels so far into the realms of fancy as to make the greater part of them eatable and drinkable ; how the brief sketch of what a zealous apprehension might conceive to be the intended plot of that section of the pantomime which precedes the transformation-can best explain. Jack is in love with Jill (or Gill)— that is a matter of course. Jill, too, is in love with Jack— not so much a matter of course as the other, as too many pining and unappreciated lovers, of either Bex, will testify. However, “ to make short tale”—as the compiler of Morte Arthure quaintly expresses it—Jill’s father, who is dead, has left a will; and in this testament it is decreed by the defunct old gentleman (doubtless a wizard), that until Jill can make a pie she Bbail not take a husband. Jack, in despair at this ill news, catches “ four and twenty blackbirds,” and gathers “ a pocket full of rye,” with which ingredients he fondly hopes they may between them be enabled “ to make and bake” the pie that shall entitle him to obtain the much enamoured Jill as future partner of his fortunes. But mortal calculations go for nothing, unless blessed and sanctified by " the skiesand Jill’s ignorance of the culinary
t,rt is worse than that of a quondam cook at the “ Fielding. * What to do?—thinks Jack, as, in agODy, he rubs two lucky ‘ sixpences together, which incontinent, and to his great i. astonishment, become a shilling—and a magic shilling to boot, that, to his still greater astonishment, conjures up the spirit of Mrs. Glasse herself, who comforts him in his , affliction and assures him of his pie and partner. What does the friendly Mrs. Glasse but—as though pro. phetic of that lore which since has made a Soyer—animate the fruits, preserves, &c. ? Under the tempting Bhapes of female fairies, young and pretty, these delicacies, thus metamorphosed into something Btill more delicate, undertake the cause of Jack, and promise that Jill (or Gill) shall be his own. Jill, returning home, finds a whole army of friende in the kettle, saucepan, fryingpan, and the rest of her kitchen ntensilSj which, personified and endowed with life and motion, become at once her slaves and counsellors. These teach her the various Bteps that lead to consummate cookery, and conduct her, moreover, to the palace of King Mustard, whose army of sauces, spices, zests, and condiments is unreservedly placed at her disposal. Now would Jill be sure to triumph, but for the jealousy of Queen Vinegar, who treacherously entices her away to the abode of Chutnee, Sultan of AH the Pickles, whose subjects are the natural enemies of the “ sweets.” The fruit-fairies, however, are not unmindful, aboveground, of Jill’s welfare, or inactive in her cause. They induce Jack to upset his pall of water; and this, by some mysterious sympathy, finds its way into the recesses of the salt mine, where dwells the pickled Sultan. The salt thus invaded melts into Balt water, and i sappears; the “ Temple of Salad” is discovered, where sweets and sours are cunningly united, and the pie of the “ four-and-twenty blackbirds” íb made evident, with raised crust and other inviting paraphernalia. Jack and Jill, being now bappy, are transformed into Harlequin and Columbine, King Mustard into Clown, Queen Vinegar into Pantaloon, and a certain salt-rock into Sprite, another Columbine, or Harlequin», joining the motiey throng, without rhyme or reason.	m
All this, doubtless, will seem very childish, but it is cleverly done. The caricatures are grotesque and droll, espe- .j cially those of the kitchen utensils and the pickles ; the balUt of the fairies, in which Mademoiselle Therese Cushnie and Miss Smith dance their best and completely fascinate the audience, is extremely pretty and well arranged; the Bcenery is good; and the principal active personages are portrayed with great spirit by M. Milano (Jack), Mdlle. Boleno (Jill), Mr. Boleno (King Mustard), and Mr. Cole (Queen Vinegar), who are severally transformed as we have described above. The scene of the “Temple of Salad,” in which is the incident of the pie, though somewhat incongruous, pleased the spectators so much that they called uproariously for Mr. Smith, and the worthy manager stepped forward to the summons, as though he had been one of the necessary ingredients, in the absence of which the salad would have been incomplete. As for the harlequinade, it was like most of the harlequinades we have witnessed for some 20 years past, with the proviso that everybody—Harlequin, Columbine, Harlequin» (Miss Honey), Clown, Pantaloon, and Sprite—seemed to have nothing to do so much as to outshine all the roet in passages of unwonted agility. After the nimble feats and inhuman postures of the four pantomimic gentlemen, the Italian brothera themselves, those “ scorners of the earth,” who came flying on the stage, whence no one could well discern, and went through their miraculous feats with a grace and apparent «ase that seemed to Bet danger at defiance, astonished the audience less vividly than they might otherwise have done. All theBe tilings, we admit, are very wonderful ; but we must at the same time protest that the true spirit of pantomime is not in them. Clown and Pantaloon should not so much be expert tumblers and preposterous acrobats as the one a cunning rogue, thief, and coward, the other a drivelling, ridiculous, and anile buffoon, the butt and scapegoat of all the others. Harleqqjn alone ought to exercise unusual agility ; while Columbine, above all, should mime with grace and pretty coquetry, and dance like a very “ Wili,” or night-dancer. As for; the sprite, he is an anomaly—a bad substitute for the previously superfluous Lover. Témpora, muían tur, however, and pan-tomineB, we suppose, must change like all things else; admitting which, we still maintain that the old system was the best, and that there was a vast deal more fun in seeing Grimaldi steal a handkerchief or pilfer goods/rom a shopwindow, with pockets capacious enough to deposit the earnings ofa hundred robberies, than any of your modern «downs tarn unexpected somersaults or emulate the activity .
oi monkeys. In the course of the harlequinade last night we were introduced to the “Turk’s Head publiohouse and hairdresser’s Bhop” (scene 8), where there were some clumsy allusions to the (Russian hear, and a good trick, in which Scbamyl is made to start out from a pot of Circassian cream, and where Clown illustrates the moustache-movement by miraculously endowing his customers with enormous whiskers at a moment’s notice; to_ the “ Great American. Baby Show,” which involves, without exception the longest and silliest extravaganza we have witnessed, notwithstanding the satire upon cod liver oil, and clown’sprizebaby, to “Scott’sojster-shop and newspaper-office” (scene 10), in which, amid a great deal of bustle and confusion,some time-honouredjokesand well-remembered surprises are shown off in not very strikingly new dresses; to a “ Hosier’s shop ana new wing of Somerset-house ” (scene 11), where the civil list is reformed, and the clerks are treated with anything but civility; to “Soyer’s Magic
Eitcheu ” (scene 12), in which the old adage of “ ton many cooks spoil the broth” is illustrated with considerable animation ; to “ An illuminated page in the history of England ” (scene 13); and last and best, to a grand allegorical tableau with panoramic effects, in which there is an imposing spectacle of the military and patriotic kind, comprising allusions to the glorious battles of the Crimea, distributions of military honours, and other such matters, with “ God save the Queen,” “ Partant pour la Syrie,” and “ Rule Britannia,” all contrived with unexieptionsble taste, and finally culminating in a magnificent coup dlteil, in which were combined all imaginable splendours of variegated light falling upon scenes and objects of bright and various colours, glittering spangles, and sparkling tinsel ad infinitum, and the really “ terrific” flight (if it were not accomplished with so little effort) of the Italian brothers as a climax. This display of gorgeous effect and ingenious contrivance was vociferously cheered, and the curtain fell to applause so unanimous that the success of the pantomime was placed beyond a question. All that Jack andJill requires at present is a littlecur-t&ilment here and there to make it perfect of its kind. The machinery worked singularly well for a first night, and the ready shifting from scene to scene showed signs of careful and efficient preparation. The pantomimists are all excellent of their kind, and, in apite of their superfluous agility,^which robbed M, Milano, the harlequin, of his perquisite, both Mr, Boleno, the clown, and Mr. Cole, the pantaloon, evinced a dry humour of their own which told upon the audience. We regretted to find that the mouldy nuisance of “ Hot Codlins” was forced upon the audience by sundry of the “gods,” aud that, much against his will, Mr. Boleno was absolutely compelled to go through, as well as he could, that most stupid and pointless of comic songs, the words of which, in many instances, appeared to have “ slipped his memory,”

cleverly rendered ; and the various evolutions of the small representatives of the armies in the Crimea were well exo
cuted and much admired; Altogether the pantomime
of-Jack and Jill may be prbijfomiced a great success, and the large expenditure' upon it will be sure to be amply repaid by its popularity! For some nights to come the mukitufle will rush only to judge of the spectacle-hud humòttr of the pantomime, "the success of which was triumphant, and a crowded house expressed their unbounded admiration, calling for the lessee. at the transformation scene "
“Globe,” Dec. 27th.
’ *‘Mr. E. T. Smith has produced his Christmas pantomime with every advantage which care, taste, and liberality could secure, and the result is a most decided success. Jack and Jill, or Harlequin King Mustard and Four-and-Ttcentg Blackbirds baked in a Pie," betrays in its title the incidents on which it is founded. A very beautiful scene follows“ so beautiful arid striking that the audience insisted on the lessee appearing to receive their congratulations. There is an abidance of laughable incidents, clever tricks, and1 no want of bustle and action. Bruin is afterwards attacked by a tiny Circassian chief—meant for Schayml—and is muzzled and led off chained, much to the delight of the audience. There is also a grand panoramic tableau, illustrative of the triumphs of the allied forces in the Crimea, and companies of Lillputiau heroes represent the British, French, and Russian forces. Our own national airs, and “ Partant pour la Syrie,” were loudly plauded. *i God save the Queen,” was even encored, le pantomime had, as we began by saying, a decided suc-3, and is, we)doubt not, destined to a long career.”
• ‘Observer,’ Dec. 31st.
“ The pantomime at Drury-lane Theatre on “ boxing night ” was, as the readers of The Observer are aware, entitled Jack and Jill. The'first“'scene presented an interior view of the Hall of Hypochondria, situated in the domains of Dulness. The blue devils, named Fog and Drizzle, Taxes and Quarterday, Spleen and Indigestion,
were busy about a weird cauldron, in which they cooked melancholy for the million. Their mistress, Misanthropy, robed in black, and riding on a pale white horse, or else on her own nightmare, came in, and exhorted her servants to make the world uncomfortable. The malieious intention Of the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was expressed, by the! entrance of her antagonist, Good Humour,. of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant representative. She arrived by the “broad grinnage line” of railway, in a car formed of a punch-bowl, and rolling on pudding wheels. This was characteristically enacted. The entertainment ended with a military trophy, surrounded by French and British soldiers, and with a martial song by Mi» Rosina Collins, attired as a vivandière, and with .several loyal and patriotic airs of the two allied nations.”
‘Era,’Dec. 31st.
“ A pantomime at this theatre is no unimportant matter either to the manager or the public. The former sees in it a large amount of profit—the latter a large amount of enjoyment; and essential, therefore, is it that it should be good and well enriched with the elements of diversion, physical and visual, npon which the fortunes of a pantomime wholly depend. Mr. Smith has hitherto given plentiful proof that he is fully aware of his responsibilities at this holiday juncture, and the Million, for whom he so
especially caters, have ratified his titles to consideration as an entrejpreneur in the fantastic and spangled world of buffoonery . His present effort is in no respect inferior to what he has done upon former ©ecasions. The vast theatre over whreh he presides is pre-othinently adapted feii* scenic displays, and for those peculiar transformations and surprises which the juvenile eye loves to look upon. Aware of hli advantages in the matter of space and machinery, and the opportunities that grow out of them, he has done ^his best to meet the exigencies of Christmas, and his pan-ig^me is ^ tiiumph accordingly. It is very smarkyory
bright, and very comic. Altogether, the pantomime reflects credit upon everybody concerned in it, especially Mr.
Edward Stirling, the stage manager, under whose judicious care it has been produced, and we prophesy, without hesitation, its long continuance in the bills.”
‘ Bell’s Life,’ Dec. 31st.
- “ The curtain -rose upon the pantomime of Jack and Jill, by Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The first scene presented an interior view of the Hall of Hypochondria, situated in the domain of Dulness. The blue devils, named Fog and Drizzle, Taxes and Quarterday, Spleen and Indigestion, were busy about a W'eird cauldron, in which they cook melancholy for the million. Their -mistress Misanthropy, robed in black, and riding on a pale white horse, or else
on her own nightmare, came in and exhorted her servants to make the world uncomfortable. The malicious intention of the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was expressed, by the entrance of her antagonist, Good Humour—of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant representative. The harlequinade is full of allusion to the great and little events of the day, . A hale of “ Manchester stuff,” containing a Quaker gentleman who brought in an obnoxious letter, was particularly noticeable. We had comforts for the Crimea, and a box of soldiers thence, who fought to the discomfiture of the Russians. The entertainment ended with a military trophy surrounded by French and British soldiers, and with a martial song by Miss
Rosina Collins, attired as a vmandiere, and with several loyal and patriotic airs of the two allied nations. It was a very brilliant and effective spectacle, and the pantomime is sure to have a run.”
‘ Illustrated London News.9 Dec. 30th.
“ As might have been expected from the extraordinary preparations so solicitously made, the pantomime at this theatre has met with remarkable suecees: it is entitled “Jack and Jill, or, Harlequin King Mustard and the Four- and-Twentg Blackbirds Baked in a Pie," and is indebted for its highly-meretorious introduction to Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The plot is of course, founded upon the
ancient nursery legends suggested by the title; but the author has evidently employed them as the means of allegorising the art of cookery. The pantomime at this house may compete with the most gorgeous at any other.”
1 Sunday Times,’ Dec. 31st.
“ It is the avowed policy of Mr. E. T. Smith to make Drury Lane the theatre of the people, and this object he has assuredly effected, if we may judge by the solid masses of spectators which were closely packed in every part of the house on Tuesday evening. Notwithstanding the number of the audience, unusual quietude prevailed, and the curtain drew up for the Christmas pantomime, Jack
and Jill; or Harlequin King Mustard and the Four-and-tmnty Blackbirds Baked in a Pie. A full description of the mysteries of the introduction, aud of the prominent points in the fable, was given by us last week, and we trust it has made sufficient impression on our readers not to require reiteration. In respect to seenic adjuncts and splendour of costume, Mr. E. T. Smith has certainly, in the present instance, outdone all his previous exertions, the scenes of the transformation and the final tableau are more brilliant aud fanciful than anything of the kind we have been accustomed to see ou the stages such as that of Drury Lane; in fact, this may be cited as a rare instance of the grand
resources of the theatre being employed to the very best
advantage. The appearance of the locality in which the transformation is effected excited universal enthusiasm, and in obedience to a general call, Mr E. T. Smith bowed his acknowledgments to the audience. All the incidents and accidents of the pantomime find a worthy and fitting termination in the illuminated page of the History of England, where juvenile English and French bands perform patriotic melodies, andin the splendid Temple of Victory, upon which the green baize is loth to fall.”

“ Times,” December 27th.
“ To have witnessed me holiday-making crowd which" thronged last night the*precincts of Old Drury, one would have thought the heart of England, whose pulse may be said to heat in thiiidmge and overgrown metropolis of London, was intent on nothing but Fun and frolic, could throb to nothing but the mimic gibe, see nothing but the clown’s grimace, applaud nothing but the evolutions of the nimble ■ harlequin, sympathise with nothing but the misfortunes of poor battered pantaloon, chuckle at nothing but the sue-cessful wiles of grotesque buffoons and rogues when exercised at the cost of the more simple and matter-of-fact scions of humanity. The truth is, that pantomime belongs to all times and circumstances ; that, whatever may be the condition of things, there must be element for laughter in the deeds and appearances both of ourselves and our neighbours, and, in short, that it is not in the “ humane ” creature to reach that standard at which all iés “faits etjestee” (as the old French chroniclers and romanists say) are above reproach, and consequently unexposed to ridicule—or, as the ironical among poets term it, “ wholesome satire.’’ And thus, we gentlemen and plebeian of united Britain, although the actual moment is possibly one upon which hangs our future destiny as a political Power, if not absolutely as a nation, can afford to laugh w hen seemingly it would far better befit us to weep, or at least to hold our breath with anxious suspense rather than our sides with overcoming fits of hilarity. But so it is ; and so it will be, in all likelihood, when the hand that pens these lines has withered, and the existing generation has passed away. The pantomime was the absorbing idea, not only with the “ gods," but with those who, being less than the “ gods” pay more—the occupants of the pit and boxes. At length the wished-for moment cable. The orchestral prelude over, the curtain was raised, to the general delight, upon the first scene, or tableau, of Jack and Gill, the “new and entirely original and extraordinary and fantastic and culinaryand what not else, Christmas pantomime, which the enterprising Mr. E. T. Smith had been for some weeks preparing for his countless friends and patrons. “ An illuminated page in the history of England” and last and best, to a grand allegorical tableau with panoramic effects, in which there is an imposing spectacle of the military and patriotic kind, comprising allusions to the glorious battles of the Crimea, distributions of military honours, and other suchjnat-ters, with “God save the Queen,” “ Partant pour la Syrie,” and “ Pule Britannia,” all contrived with unexceptionable taste, and finally culminating in a magnificent coup d'œil, in which were combined all imaginable splendours of variegated light falling upon scenes and objects of bright and various colours, glittering spangles, and sparkling tinsel, ad infinitum, and the really “ terrific ” flight (if it were not accomplished with so little effort) of the Italian brothers as a climax. This display of gorgeous effect and ingenious contrivance was vociferously cheered, and the curtain fell to applause so unanimous that the success of the pantomime was placed beyond a question.”
“ Morning Post," Dec. 27th
“ The new Christmas pantomime, entitled “ Jack and Jill; or, Harlequin King Mustard, and the Four and Twenty Blackbirds baked in a" pie,” arid maybe described in général terms as extraordinary, literary, traditionary, comic, gas-tronomical, and peculiarly culinary, fantastical, domestic, and grand, The feats of agility are very extraordinary. Cue. Italian Brother takes a flight from the front of the.
theatre to the stage, where he is joined by his brother, and
they both performed on the suspended ropes. The allusions were numerous to the war ; there were also a great many changes, and two excellent masks, one of Monsieur Jullien and the other Soyer. The, pantomime is full to overflowing of hustle Jand “business,” and bf no means deficient in loyàlty, as the audience had to rise three times to-the national anthem, and twice to “ Partant peur la Syrie.” The last scene is, if possible, ¿till'more elegant and magnificent than that already alluded to:; All up the sides of the stage are revolving 'ànff illuminated' colnains, and in the centre is
a Temple of Fame, which also revolves, in the niches of winch are splendidly attired allegorical -females; to all this is added various coloured lights, producing an effect that
defies description.” ‘	,
“ Morning Chronicle,” Dec. 27th.
“ It is no easy matter now-a-days to fill the spacious area of Drury-lane, but this feat was accomplished last night by Mr.- E. T. Smith, the lessee of the theatre, by th* promised attractions held out in his pantomime of Jack and Jill, or Harlequin King Mustard. The programme in the bills of the evening set forth a succession of jests that was irresistibly tempting, and wc are bound to add that the performance did not belie the promises. The pantomime is to the full as diverting, funny, and extravagant as one would wiffi to jsik The best critics of such pieces always are the young, and, tried by the test of their interest, the success of the pantomime was triumphant; the merry laughter of the children, alternating vmh their shouts of delighted wonder, kept up a running commentary upon the whole performance.» Upon the whole, the pantomime at Old Drury this year is fully equal to any of its predecessors, and we know not that a family, in search of amuse- * ment at that festive season will meet with it more readily than in witnessing the performance of Jack and Jill."
“Morning1 Herald,”
Dec. 27th.	3
“ Large as this theatre is, it was insufficient for the host of holiday visitors who flocked to it last night, attracted doubtless by the very attractive bill of pantomime fare put forth by the manager. Although a crowded house, and boxing-night, the gods were not *o noisy as usual. Jack and Jill, or Harlequin King Mustard and Four-and-Tvxnty Blackbirds baked in a Pie, betrays in its title the incidents on which it is founded. First appeares Hypochondriac Hall, tenanted by blue devils, who, when the curtain irises, are gathered round a cauldron in a cave dismally blue, brewing melancholy for the million. They are interrupted by the arrival of Good Humour in a fairy car, of which a wassail-bowl forms the body and plum-puddings the - wheels, and are put to flight almost at her very appearance, so hard is it for spleen and melancholy to abide the sight of good-nature and good-humour. There is also a grand panoramic tableau, illustrative of the triumphs of the allied forces in the Crimea, and companies of Lilliputian heroes represent the^ British, French, and Russian forces. Our own national ips, and “Pourtaut pour la Syrie,”- were loudly applauded. “God save the Queen” was even encored. Of the performers in the pantomime nothing can be said but what is to their praise. Besides some graceful dancing by Mdlle. Therese, and Andie Cushnie, and Miss
Smith, the Italian' brothers astonished the audience by their wonderful, performances. The scenery is dazzingly beautiful, and would alone be worth a visit.” " .
“Morning Advertiser,” Dec. 27th.
“ The extraordinary success attained by the present lessee of this theatre seems only to stimulhte to redouble his efforts, and to expend en magnificent novelties the profits thus deservedly acquired. The pantomime he has produced has evidently had no expense spared upon it, and the gorgeous scenery, the magnificent dresses, the innumerable ingenious contrivances in the way of m&sks, tricks, and transformations, equal if _ they do not surpass, anything we recollect; even in the ¿lost glorious'days of pantomime. This species of entertainment seem« to be again iully in the ascendant, and to have recouqimrpd the hold* on ike public taste which burlesque for'a time usurped.- The causes fthy this shohld be thus it were tedious npw to tell, but so it is; and there must be Some strong affinities with our nature* in this specie of entertain- ‘ ment, that* confer on it a perennial attraction, in the < comic portion the transparencies' illustrating the war ar-

cleverly rendered ; and the various evolutions of the small representatives of the armies in the Crimea were well ext cuted and much admired. Altogether the pantomime of Jack and Jill may be pronounced a great success, and the large expenditure upon it will be sure to be amply repaid by its popularity. For some nights to come the multitude will rush only to judge of the spectacle and humour of the pantomime, the success of which was triumphant, and a crowded house expressed their unbounded admiration, calling for the lessee at the' transformation in ijjftiTfm LflflOiiüii to 030 ‘ri i«qq« Hiv
“Globe,” Bee. 27th.	^
“Mr, E. T. Smith has produced his Christmas panto-
mima-with every advantage which care, taste, and liberality
could	and the result is; a most decided success.
Jack and Jill, or Harlequin King Mustard and Four-and-Twenty Blackbirds baked in a Pie,” betrays in its title the incidents on. which it is founded. A very beautiful scene follows, so beautiful and striking that the audience insisted on the r lessee appeapripgfto receive their congratulations. There ,u-is an abunaæn^i ® f laughable incidents, clever tricks, and no want of bustle and action. Bruin is afterwards attacked by a tiny Circassian chief—meant for Schaymi—-and is muzzled and led off chained, much to the delight of the audience. there is also à grand panoramic tableau, illustrative of the triumphs of the allied forces in the Crimea, and companies of Lillputian heroes represent the British, French, and Russian forces. Our own national airs, and “ Partant pour la Syrie,” were loudly applauded; “God save'’the Queen,” was even ehffOfed. The pantomime had, as we began by saying, a decided success, and is, wepïoubt not, destined to a long career.”
‘Observer,’ Dec. 31st.
“The pantomime at Drury-lane Theatre on “boxing night” was, as tlie readers of The Observer are aware, enticed Jack and Jill. The first scene presented an interior ' view of the' Hall of Hypochondria, situated in the, domains of Dulness. The blue devils, named Fog and lXrizzle,vTaxes and Quarterday, Spleen and Indigestion, were busy about a weird cauldron, in. which they cooked melancholy for the million. Their mistress, Misanthropy, rdjbed in black, and riding on a pale white horse, or else on h£r OWn nightmare, came In, aììd exh'brtedlier servants to make the world uncomfortable. The malicious intention of the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was expressed, by th< entrance of her antagonist, Good Humour, of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant representative. She arrived by the “ broad grinnage line ” of railway, in a car formed of a {runch-bowl, and rolling on pudding wheels. This was characteristically enacted.^The
entertainment ended with a military trophy, surrounded
by French and British soldiers, and with, a martial song by Miss. Rosina, Collins, attired as a vivandière, and with several loyal and patriotic airs of the two allied nations.”
‘Era,’ Dec. 31st.

* A pantomime at this theatre is no unimportant matter either to the manager or the public. The former sees in it a large amount of profit—the latter a large amount of enjoyinent ; and essential, therefore, is it that it should be gbod and Well enriched with the elements of diversion, physical and visual, upon which the fortunes of a pantomime wholly depend. Mr. Smith has hitherto given plentiful proof that he is fully aware of his responsibilities at this ’hofiday ’juncture, arid thé Million, for whom he so
especially caters, have ratified his titles to consideration as an entrepreneur in the fantastic apd spangled world of buififeuery. His present effort is in no respect inferior to what he has done upon former occasions. The vast theatre over which he presides is pre^emineatty adapted for scenic displays, and for those peculiar transformations and surprises which the juvenile eye loves to look upon. Aware of hts adVantages in the ‘matter of space and machinery, and the-'opportunities that grow out of them, he has done his best to meet the exigencies of Christmas, and his pantomime is a triumph accordingly. It is very smart, very
MFJJv i »ml w ki'l ml vmêm-wup l 9T& Klfiu.
bright, and very comic. Altogether, the pantomime reflects
credit upon everybody concerned in it, especially Mr. Edward Stirling, the stage manager, under whose judicious care it has been produced, and we prophesy, without hesitation, its long, continuance in the bills.”
‘ Bells Life,’ Bee. 31st.
. The curtain rose upon the-pantomime pf Jackand Jill, by Mr. E. L. Blanchard. .The first scene presented an interior view of the Hall of Hypochondria, situated in the domain of Dulness. The blue devils,1" named Fog and Drizzle, Taxes and Quarterday, Spleen and Indigestion, were’ busy about ' a weird cauldron, in which they cook melancholy for the million. Their mistress, Misanthropy, robed in black, and -idnig on a pale white horse, or. else
on her Qwa nightmare, came in and exhorted her servants to make the world uncomfortable, The malicious intention of the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was expressed, by the entrance of her antagonist, Good Humour—of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant representative. The harlequinade is full of allusion to the great and little eventi of the day.-' A bale of “ Manchester scuff,” containing a Quaker gentleman who brought in an obnoxious letter, was particularly noticeable. We had comforts for the Crimea, and a box of soldiers thence, \yho fought to the discomfiture of the Russians. The entertainment ended with a military trophy surrounded by French and British soldiers, and with a martial song by Miss Rosina Collins, attired as a vivandière, and with several .loyal and patriotic,toirs of the two allied nations. ? It was a very brilliant and effective spectacle, and the pantomime is sure to have a run.”	-
‘ Illustrated London Hews.’ r “¡¡S** Dec. 30th.
). “ As migh$ hfive been expected from the .extraordinary preparations so solicitously made, the pantomime at this theatre has met with remarkable siiccees : it is entitled “•Jack and Jill, ór, Harlequin King Mustard and the
Fpur-and- Twenty Blackbirds Baked in a PlcJ and is indebtedfor its highly-nieretbrious introduction to Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The plot is of course, founded upon the ancient nursery legends suggested by the title; but ,the author has evidently employed them as the means., of allegorising the art of cookery. The pantomime at this house may compete with the most gorgeous at any other.”
* Sunday Times,’ Bee. 31st.
“ It is the avowed policy of Mr. E. T. Smith to make Drury Lane thè'theatre of the people, and-this object he has assuredly effected, if we may judge by the sdiid masses
of spectators which were closely packed in every part of
the house on Tuesday evening. Notwithstanding the number of the audience, unusual quietude prevailed, and the curtain drew' up for the Christmas pantomime, Jack and Jill-, or Harlequin King Mustard and the Four-and-tiventy Blackbirds Baked in a Pie. A full description of the mysteries of the introduction, and of the prominent points ill the fable, was given by us last week, and we trust it has made sufficient impression on our readers not to require reiteration. In respect to scenic adjuncts and splendour of costume, Mr. E. T. Smith has certainly, in the present instance, outdone all his previous exertions , the scenes of the transformation and the final tableau are more brilliant and fanciful than anything of the kind we have been ai&tìs-
tomed to see on the stages such as that of Drury Lape ; in fact, this may be cited as a rare instance of the grand resources of the , theatre being employed to the very best advantage. The appearance of the locality in w hich the transformation is effected excited universal enthusiasm, and jn pbedjence to a general call, Mr E. X. Smith bowed his acknowledgments to the audience. All the incidents - and accidents of the pantomime find a worthy and fitting termination in the illuminated page of the History of England, where juvenile English and French bands perform patriotic melodies, anditi the splendid Temple of Victory, upon which the green baize is loth to fall.”

Times,” December 27th.

“ To have witnessed the holiday-making crowd which thronged last night the precincts of Old Drury, one would have thought the heart of England, whose pulse may be said to beat in this huge and overgrown metropolis of London, was intent on nothing but fun and frolic, could throb to nothing but the mimic gibe, see nothing but the clown’s grimace, applaud nothing but the evolutions of the nimble harlequin, sympathise with nothing but the misfortunes of poor- battered pantaloon, chuckle at nothing but the successful wiles of grotesque huifoons and rogues when exer-eised at the cost of the more simple and matter-of-fact Scions of humanity. The truth is. that pantomime belongs to all times' and circuififetances ; that, whatever may be thé condition of things, there must be element for laughter in' the deeds and appearances both of ourselves and our neigh-, hours, and, in short, that it is not in the “ humane” creature to reach that standard at which all its ‘\faits etjestee” (as the old French chroniclers and romanists say) are above reproach, and consequently unexposed to ridicule—or, as the ironical among poets term it, “ wholesome satire.’’ , And thus, we gentleipen and plebeian of united Britain, although the actual moment is possibly one upon which hangs our future destiny as a political Power, if not absolutely as a nation, can afford to laugh when seemingly it would far better befit us to weep, or at least to hold our breath with anxious suspense rather than our sides with overcoming fits of hilarity. But so it is ; and so it will be, in all likelihood, when the hand that pens these lines has w ithered, and the existing generation has passed away. The pantomime was the absorbing idea, not only with the “ gods,” but with those who, being less than the “ gods” pay niofe—the occupants of the pit and boxes. At length, the wisked-for moment came. The orchestral preludq over, the curtain wqs raised, to the general delight, upoq the first scene, or tableau, of Jack and Gill, the “ new .	, and entirely original and extraordinary and fantastic and
mlinaryapd what not else, dGhristinas pantomime, which■ the enterprising Mr. ïï. T. Smith had been for some weeks-p&pàring for his cduntlesv friends and patron!.** “ Àndlhi' minated page in the history of England" and last and best, to a grand allegorical tableau with panoramic effects, in which there is an imposing spectacle of the military and patriotic kind, comprising allusions to the glorious battles of the Crimea, distributions of military honours, and othersuchjmat-ters,with “God save the Queen/’. “ Partant pour la Syrie,” and “ Rule Britannia,” all contrived with unexcèptîonahlè taste, and finally culminating in a magnificent amp d'œil, in which were combined all imaginable splendours of variegated light falling upon scenes and objects of bright and
various colours, glittering spangles, and sparkling tinsel, ad infinitum, and the really “ terrific ” flight (if it were not accomplished with so little effort) of the Italian brothers as a climax. This display of gorg^oqs effect and ingenious contrivance was vociferously cheered, and the curtain fell to applause sq unanimous that the success of the pantomime was placed beyond a question.” -
“ Morning Post,” Dec. 27th
“The new Christmas pantomime, entitled “Jack and Jill; or, Harlequin King Mustard, and the Four and Twenty Blackbirds baked in a pie,” and may be described iri general
. terms as. extraordionarv, literary, traditionary, comic, gas-tronomical, and peculiarly culinary, fantastical, domestic, and grand, The feats of agility are very extraordinary. One Italian Brother takes a flight from the front of the théâtre to the stage, where he is joined by his brother, and . they both performed on the suspended ropes. The allusions Wer^ numerous to the war ; .there were also’ a great many * changes, and two excellent masks, one of Monsieur Jullien and the other Soyer. The pantomime is full to overflowing, of bustle land “business,” and by no means deficient in loyàlty, as the audience had tp rise three times to the national anthem, and twice to “ Partant pour la Svrie.” The laßt scene is, if possible, still more elegant arid magnificent than that already alluded to, AU up the sides of the stage are revolving and illuminated columns, and in the centre is
a Temple of Fame, which also revolves, in the niches of which are splendidly attired allegorical fein îles ; to all this is added various coloured lights, producing an effect that defies description.”

“It is no easy matter now-a-days to fill the spacious area of Drury-lane, but this feat was accomplished last night by Mr. E. T. Smith, the lessee of the theatre, by the promised attractions held out in his pantomime of Jack -and Jill, or Harlequin King Mustard. The programme in the bills of the evening set forth a succession of jests that was irresistibly tempting, ami we are bound to add that the performance did not belie the promises. The pantomime is to the full as diverting, funny, and extravagant as one WQuldwish to see. The best critics of such pieces always are the young, and, tried by the test of their interest, the success of the pantomime was triumphant; the merry laughter of the children, alternating with their shouts of delighted wonder, kept up a running commentary upon the whole performance. Upon the whole, the pantomime at Old Drury this year is fully equal to any of its predecessors, and we know not tqat a, family,'in search of amusement at that festive season will meet .with it more readily than in witnessing the performance of Jack and Jill,''

There, is also, a grand panoramic tableau, illustrative of the triumphs of the allied forces iii the Crimea, and companies of Lilliputian heroes represent the British, French, and Russian forces. Our own national airs, and “ Ponrtaut pour la Syne,” were
loudly applauded. “ God save the Queen ” was even encored. Of the performers in the pantomime nothing can be said but what is to. their praise. .-Besides some graceful dancing by Mdlle.

Altogether the pantomime of Jack and Jill may be pronounced a great success, and^the large expenditure upon it will be sure to be amply repaid by its popularity. For some nights to come the multitude will rush only to judge of the spectacle and humour of the pantomime, the success of which was triump^nt^nd a crowded house expressed their unbounded

“Mr.‘El T. Smith has produced his Christmas panto-minffi'jwith ever}7 advantage which care, taste, and liberality could-secure, and the result is a most decided success.

n A pantomime at this theatre is no unimportant matter eithe 3 manager or the public. The former sees in it a large amount of profit—the latter a large amount of
enjoyment; "’and essential, therefore, is it that it should be good and well enriched with the element« of diversion, physical and visual, upon which the fortunes of a pantomime wholly ^depend. Mr. Smith has hitherto given plentiful proof .that he is fully aware of his responsibilities at thisIholi^y .'juncture, and the Million, for whom he so especially caters, have ratified his titles to consideration as an Cntrepfeiieur iu the fantastic and spangled world of buffoonery. His present effort is in no respect.inferior to what he has done upon former occasions. The vast theatre over wl|ish he presides is pre-eminently, adapted for scenic lisplays, and for those peculiar transformations and sur-
Tises which .the juvenile eye loves to look upon. Aware
of his advantages in the matter of space and machinery, and the opportunities that grow out of them, he has done his-best to meet the exigencies of Christmas, and his pantomime is»a triumph accordingly. It is very smart, very
Spnr.WAYl-.uu ji• ' - • y“H ’ •'¿Va/T.n TOT iwH p auli ^y^t-sruu 8 -ii>xt* MtauAU
bright, and-very comic. Altogether, the pantomime reflects credit upon everybody ooncerned iu it, especially Mr. Edward Stirling, the stage manager, under whose judicious care it has been produced, and we prophesy, without hesitation, its long continuance in the bills.”
^ ‘Bells Lift,’ Dec. 31st.
“ The curtain rose upon the pantomime of Jack and Jill, by Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The first sdeue presented an interior view of the Hall of Hypochondria, situated iu the
domain of Dulness. The blue devils, named Fog and Drizzle, Taxes and Quarterday, Spleen and Indigestion, Were busy about a weird cauldron, in which they cook melancholy for the million. Their mistress, Misanthropy, robed in black, and riding on a pale white horse, or else on her own nightmare, came in and exhorted her servants to make the world uncomfortable. The malicious intention of the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was expressed, by the entrance of her antagonist, Good Hu-mour—of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant representa-‘ five. The harlequinade is full of illusion to the great and little events of the (fay. A bare of “ Manchester stuff,” containing a Quaker gentleman who brought in an obnoxious letter, was particularly noticeable. We had comforts for the Crimea, and a box of soldiers thence, who fought to the discomfiture of the Russians. The entertainment ended with a military trophy surrounded by French and British soldiers, and with a martial song by Miss Rosina Collins, attired as a vivandière, and with several loyal and patriotic airs qf the iwo allied nations. It was a veiyvbrilfknt and effective spectacle, and the pantomime is sure to have a run.”	V jF JM

“ As might have been expected from the extraordinary preparations so solicitously made, the pantomime at this theatre has met with remarkable succees : it is entitled “Jack and Jill, or, Harlequin King Mustard and the Four-and-Twenty Blackbirds Baked in a Fie," 'and is indebted for its highly-meretorious introduction to Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The plot is of course, founded upon the ancient nursery legends suggested by the title ; but the author has evidently employed them as the means of allegorising the art of cookery. The pantomime at this house may compete with the most gorgeous at any other.”
1 Sunday Times,’ Dee. 3isi.
"‘It.is the avowed policy of Mr, E. T. Smith to make Drury Lane the theatre of the people, and this object he has assuredly effected, if we may judge by the solid masses of spectators which were closely packed in every part of the house on Tuesday evening. Notwithstanding the number of the àudience, unusual quietude prevailed, and the curtain drew up for the Christmas pantomime, Jack and Jill ; or Harlequin King Mustard and the Four-and-twenty Blackbirds Baked in, a Pie. A full description of the mysteries of the introduction, and of the prominent points in the fable, was given by us last week, and we trust it has made sufficient impression on our readers not to require
reiteration.' Tn respect to scenic adjuncts and splendour
of costume, Mr. E. T. Smith has certainly, in the present instance, outdone Ml his previous exertions, the scenes of the transformation aud the final tableau are more brilliant and fanciful than anything of the kind we have been accustomed to see on the stages such as that of Druiy Lane; in fact, this may be cited as a rare instance of the grand resources of the theatre being employed to the very best advantage. The appearance of the locality in which the transformation is effected excited universal enthusiasm, and in obedience to a, general call, Mr E. T. Smith bowed his acknowledgments to the audience. All the incidents and accidents of the pantomime find a worthy and fitting termination in the illuminated page of the History of England, where juvenile English and French bands perform patriotic melodies, andin the splendid Temple of Victory, upon which the green baize is loth to fall.”

Times,” December 27th.
To have witnessed the holiday-making crowd which thronged last night the precincts of Old Drury, one would have thought the heart of England, whose pulse may he said to beat in this huge and overgrown metropolis of London, was intent on nothing but fun and frolic, could throb to nothing but the mimic gibe, see nothing but the clown's grimace, applaud nothing but the evolutions of the nimble harlequin, sympathise with nothing but the misfortunes of poor battered pantaloon, chuckle at nothing hut the successful wiles of grotesque buffoons and rogues when exercised at the cost of the more simple and matter-of-fact scions of humanity. The truth is, that pantomime belongs to all times and circumstances; that, whatever maybe the condition of things, there must be element for laughter in the deeds and appearances both of ourselves and our neighbours, and, in short, that it is not in the “ humane ” creature to reach that standard at which all its "faits etjestee”
(as the old French chroniclers and romanists say) are above reproach, and consequently unexposed to ridicule—or, as the ironical among poets term it, “ wholesome satire.’’
And thus, we gentlemen and plebeian of united Britain, although the actual moment is possibly one upon which hangs our future destiny as a political Power, if not absolutely as a nation, can afford to laugh when seemingly it would far better befit us to weep, or at least to hold our breath with anxious suspense rather than our sides with overcoming fits of hilarity. But so it is ; and so it will be, in all likelihood, when the hand that pens these lines has withered, and the existing generation has passed away. The pantomime was the absorbing idea, not only with the “ gods,” but with those who, being less than the “ gods” pay more:—the occupants of the pit and boxes. At length the wished-for moment came. The orchestral prelude over, the curtain was raised, to t}ie general delight, upon the first scene, or tableau, of Jack and Gill, the “ new and entirely original and extraordinary and fantastic and culinary,” and what not else, Christmas pantomime, which the''enterprising Mr. E. T. Smith had been for some weeks preparing for liis countless friends and patrons. “ An illuminated page in the history of England * and last and best, to a grand allegorical tableau with panoramic effects, in which there is an imposing spectacle of the military and patriotic kind, comprising allusions to the glorious battles of the Crimea, distributions of military honours, and othersuch'mat-ters, with “ God save the Queen,” “ Partant pour la Syrie,”, and “ Buie Britannia,” all contrived with unexceptionable taste, and finally culminating in a magnificent coup d'œil, in which were combined all imaginable splendours of variegated light falling upon scenes and objects of bright and various colours, glittering spangles, and sparkling tinsel, ad infinitum, and the really “ terrific ” fiight (if it were adit accomplished with so little effort) of the Italian brothers as a cîimax. This display of gorgeous effect and ingenious contrivance was vociferously cheered, and the curtain fell to applause so unanimous that the success of the pantomime was placed beyond a question.”
“ morning Post,” Dec. 27th
“The new Christmas pantomime, entitled “ Jack and Jill; or, Harlequin King Mustard, and th e Four and Twenty . Blackbirds baked in a pie,” and may be described in general terms as extraordiouary, literary, traditionary, comic, gas-J ‘ tronomical, and peculiarly culinary, fantastical, domestic! and grand, The feats of agility are Very extraordinary.’ One Italian Brother takes a flight from the front of the theatre to the stage, where he is joined by his brother, and they both performed on the suspended ropes. The allusions were numerous to the war ; there were also a great many changes, and two excellent masks, one of Monsieur Jullien and the other Soyer. The pantomime is full to overflowing of bssfie ymd “business,” and by n© means deficient in loytlty, ft* thé audience had to rise three fames to. the national anther*, and twice to “ Fartant pour la Syrie.” The , last scene is, if possible, still more elegant and magnificent than chut already alluded to. All up the sides of the stage, are revolving aud illuminated columns, and in the centre is

a Temple of Fame, which also revolves, in the niche? of which are splendidly attired allegorical females; to all this is added various coloured lights, producing an ^effect that
defies description.” «14 8dT .a 3M332

“The pantomime at Drury-lane Theatre on “boding
night” was, as the readers, of The Observer,^ aware, entitled Jack and Jill. The,first scene presented ah interior view of the Hall of Hypochondria, situateti in- the5, domains of Dulness. The blue devils, named Fog and Drizzle, Taxes and. Quarterday, Spleen and’ Indigestion, were busy about--a weird cauldron, in which they cdoked ■ melancholy for the million. Their mistress, Misanthropy, robed in black, and riding, ou a pale white. lmr|^ or else qn her own nightmare, came in, aud.qxhorfed her servants to0 -make the world uncomfortable. The malicious intention I of the sombre queen was counteracted, as speri as it was expressed, by the" entrance of her antagonist, Good Humour, of whom Miss Arden was'fhe'pfeasant representative. She‘an-rved by the,w broad graruage line” of railway, in a car formed of a punch-bowl, and rolling ton pudding wheels. This was characteristically enacted-. The entertainment ended with a military trophy, surrounded by French and British soldiers, and with a martial song by Miss Rosina Collins, attired as a vivandière, and. with several loyal and patriotic airs of the two allied nations."',

“ A pantomime at thislhqatre js no Unimportant matter-' either to the manager or the public*. The former sees in it a large amount òr profit—the latter*- a- large-amount of enjoyment; and essential, thepj/ore, is it thatrit should be good and well enriched“ with the elements of diversion, physical and visual, upon which the fortunes of a panto-' mime wholly depend. Mr. Smith has hitherto given plentiful proof that he is fully aware of his responsibilities at this holiday juncture, and the Million, for whom he so especially caters, have ratified his titles to consideration • as an entrepreneur in the fantastic and spangled .world of buffoonery. His present effort is in no respect inferior to what he has done upon former occasions. The vast theatre over which he presides k pre-eminently adapted for scenic displays, and for those peculiar transformations and surprises which the juvenile eye- loves to look upon. Aware of his advantages in the matter of space and machinery, and the opportunities that grow out of them, he has done his best to meet the exigencies of: Christmas, and his pantomime is a triumph accordingly?

(as the old French ehrouiclcraand romaniste say) are ab< ive reproach, and consequently unexpose;! to ridicule—or. us the ironical among poets tetni it, wholesome satire.'’ And thus, we gentlemen and plebeian of united Britain, although the actual moment is possibly due upon-vvhiclt hangs our future destiny as a political Towel, if not absolutely as a nation, can afford to laugh .wired seemingly it 1 would far better befit us to weep, or at least to he ld ,nur breath with anxious suspense rather than' our sides with, overcoming fits of hilarity.

Their mistress, Misanthropy, robed in black, and riding on a pale white horse, or else on her own nightmare, caine ifc. and gxitorted her servants to make the world uncomfortable. The. malicious intention of the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was expressed, by the entrance of her antagonist, Good Humour, of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant Representative. She arrived by the “ jyroad gidhnage line ” of railway, in a car formed, of a punch-bowl, and rolling on pudding wheels. Thi$ wa? ghgy&cteristically enacted.

‘Era,’ Dee. 31st.
* A pantomime at this' theatre is no unimportant 'mattqr either to the manager or the nphU?- The’ farmer sees in it a large amount of profit-—thp la'tipr a Targe amount of enjoyment; and essential, therefore, is It that if should be good and well enriched with the elements of diversion, physical and visual, upon which the fortunes of u pantomime wholly depend. Mr. Sfeith has hitherto given plentiful proof that he is fully aware of his responsibilities at this holiday juncture,, aud. the Million, for whom he so especially caters, have ratified his titles to consideration; as an entrepreneur in the fantastic ifcd spaugled world of buffoonery. His present effort is irrho j&espeofc inferior to what he has done upon former occasions» The vast theatre over which he presides is pre-eminently adapted for scenic displays, and for those peculiar transformations and sur- „ prises which the juvenile eye loves to look upon. Awaxo of Ms advantages in the matter of «pace and machinery, and the opportunities thstf grow out. of them, he has done his best tp meet tip: exigencies of Christmas, arid-his pan- • tomime is a triumph accordingly. It is very smart, very
bright, and very comic. Altogether, the pantomime reflects credit upon everybody concerned in it, especially Mr. Edward Stirling, the stage manager, under whose judicious
Care it has been produced, and we prophesy, without hesitation, its long continuance in the bills.”

of the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was expressed, by the entrance of her antagonist, Good Hu-momu—of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant representative. The harlequinade is full of allusion to the great and little yvents of the day. A bale of “ Manchester stuff,” containing a Quaker gentleman Who brought in an obnoxious letter, was particularly noticeable. We had comforts for the Crimea, and a box of soldiers thpnce, who fofight to the discomfiture of the Russians. The entertainment, ended with a military trophy surrounded by French ana British soldiers, and with a martial song by Miss Rosiua Collins, attired as a vivandiere, and with several
loyal and patriotic airs of the two allied nations. It was a very brilliant and" effective spectacle, and the pantomime is sure to hare a run.”

“As might have been expected from the extraordinary preparations so Solicitously made, the pantomime at this theatre has met with remarkable succees t it is entitled “ Jack and-Jill, or, Harlequin King Mustard and the Four-and- Twenty Blackbirds Baked in a Pie,'* and is indebted for its hlghly-mereterious introduction to Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The plot is of course, founded upon the ancient nursery legends suggested by the title; but the »1 author has evidently employed them as the means of allegorising the art of cookery. The pantomime at this house may compete with the most gorgeous at any other.”
‘ Sunday Times,’ Dec. 31st.
“It is the avowed policy of Mr. E. T. Smith to make Drury Lane the theatre of the people, and this object he has assuredly effected, if we may judge by the solid masses of spectators which were closely packed in every part of the house on Tuesday evening. Notwithstanding the number of the Audience, unusual quietude prevailed, and
the curtain drew up" for the Christmas pantomime, Jack
arid Jill; or Harlequin King Mustard and the Four-and-twenty Blaekbifds Baked, in d Pie. A full.description of the mysteries of the mtfcdtictfon, and of the prominent points in the fable, was given by us last,week, .and we trust it has made sufficient impression on our readers" not to require reiteration. In,,respect to scenic adjuncts and splendour . df costume, Mr. E. T. Smith has certainly, in the present ■ ■ instance, outdone all his previous exertions, the scenes of the transformation apd the final tableau are more brilliant
and fanciful than anything of the kind we have been accustomed to see on the stages such as that of Drury Lane; in fact, this may be cited as a rare instance of the grand
resources of the theatre being employed to the very best advantage. The. appearance of the locality in which the transformation. i8 effected excited -universal enthusiasm, and jn obedience to & general-call, Mr E. T. Smith bowed his acknowledgments to the fudi,ence. All the incidents and accidents of the pantomime find a worthy and fitting termination-in the illuminated page of the History of England, where juvenile English and French bands perform patriotic melodies, andin the splendid Temple of Victor}-, upon which the green baize is loth to fall.’'

“ 1 “ Times,” December 27th.
“ To have witnessed the holiday-making crowd which thronged last night the precincts of Old Drury, one would
have thought the heart of England, whose pulse may be said to beat in this huge and overgrown metropolis of Lon-*, don, was intent on nothing but fun and frolic, could thrèh to nothing hut the mimic gibe,.see nothing but the clown’s grimace, applaud nothing but tho evolutions of the nimblë harlequin, sympathise with nothing but the misfortunes of poor battered pantaloon, chuckle at nothing but the successful wiles of grotesque buffoons and rogues when exer-; cised at the cost of the more simple and tnatter-of-faôt »cions of humanity. The truth is, that pantomime belongs to all times and circumstances ; that, whatever may be the condition of things, there must be element for laughter in the deeds and appearances both of ourselves and our neigh-h, hours, and, in short, that it is not in the “ humane ” créa-true to reach that standard at which all its “faits etjestee" (as the old French chroniclers and romanists say) are above reproach, and consequently unexposed to ridicule—or, as the ironical among poets term it, “ wholesome satire.*’ And thus, we gentlemen and plebeian of united Britain, although 'the actual moment is possibly one upon which hangs our future destiny as a political Power, if not absolutely as a nation, can afford to laugh" when seemingly i( would far better befit us to weep, 6r at least to hold our breath with anxious suspense rather thaii our sides with . overcoming fits of hilarity. But so it is ; and so it will be, in all likelihood, when the hand that pens these lines .has withered, and the existing generation has passed away. The pantomime was the absorbing idea, not only with the “ gods,” but with those who, being less than the “ gods”
, pay more—the occupants of the pit and boxes. Atjength ; the wishefi-for moment came. The orchestral prelude ovçr< the curtain was raised, to the general delight, upon the first scene, or tableau, of Jack and Gill, the “ new and entirely, orignal and extraordinary and fantastic and culinary," and what not else, Christmas pantomime, which the enterprising Mr. E. T. Smith had been for some weeks prepar ing for his countless friends and patrons. “ An illu-ruinated page in thé history of England ” and last and best, to K '■ a grand allegorical tableau with panoramic effects, in which , there is an imposing spectacle of the military and patriotic kind, comprising allusions to the glorious battles of the
Crimea,distributions of military honours, and othersuch'mat-. ters, with “ God save the Queen,” “Partant pour la Syrie,” and “ Rule Britannia,” all contrived with unexceptionable taste, anil finally culminating in a magnificent coup d'œil, m which were combined all imaginable splendours of variegated light falling upon scenes and objects of bright and various colours, glittering spangles, and sparkling tinsel, ad infinitum, and the really “ terrific ” flight (if it were not accomplished with so little effort) of the Italian brothers as a climax. This display of gorgeous effect and ingenious contrivance was vociferously cheered, and the curtain fell hjJto applause so ulanimohs that the success of the pantomime
was placed beyond a question.”
“ Morning Post,” Dec. 27th
“The new Christmas pantomime, entitled “Jack and Jill; or, Harlequin King Mustard, and the Four and Twenty Blackbirds baked in a pie,” and may be described in general terms as extraordionary, literary, traditionary, comic, gas, tronomical, and peculiarly culinary, fantastical, domestic, and grand, The feats of agility are very extraordinary.
■ One Italian Brother takes a flight from the front of the theatre to the stage, where he is joined by his brother, and they botli performed on the suspended ropes. The allusions
were numerous to the war ; there were also a great many • chariges, and two excellent masks, one of Monsieur Jullien 1 .and the other Shyer. The pantomime is full to overflowing of bustle and n business,*’ and by no means defcient in loyalty, as the audience had to rise three times to the hfcu tional anthem, and twice to “ Partant pour In Üyrie,” The last scene is, if possible, still more elegant and magnificent han that already alluded to. All up the sides of the .stage are revolving and illuminated columns, and in the centre is

The programme in the bills of thé evening set forth a sa	jest^atewas irre-

The best ëritlcr ofîmch^ces always are thé young, and, tried by the test ;of their Interest, the success of Abe pantomime was triumphant Aha merry laughter of the children, alternating with their shouts cf delighted wonder, kept up a running voVi meifi ary-upon tiie yyhole performance, Upon the whole, the pantomime at Old Drury this year is fully equal to any of its predeces-s6rs? aha we know not that a family, in search of amusement at that festivç seasoq will meet with it more readily than in witnessing thq pepformapee of Jack and Jill.”

cleveerly rendered; and the various evolutions of the small representatives of the armies in the Crimea were well exe euteod and much admired. Altogether the pantomime of Jtack and Jill may be pronounced a great success, and the large expenditure upon it will be sure to be amplly repaid by its popularity. For some nights to eomee the multitude will rush only to judge of the spectacle and lliumour of the pantomime, the success of which was triumnphant, and a crowded house expressed their unbounded udmiiration, calling for the lessee at the transformation scenee.”	*
“Globe,” Sec. 27th-
“3Mr. E. T. Smith has produced his Christmas panto* mimae with every advantage which cafe, taste, and liberality couldd secure, and the result is ft most decided success. Jackk and Jill, or Harlequin King Mustard and Four-and-Twemty Blackbirds baked in a Pie," betrays in its title the inciddents on which it is founded. A very beautiful scene follows, so beautiful and striking that the audience insisted on tthe lessee appearing to receive their congratulations. Thetre is an abundance of laughable incidents, clever trickles, and no want of bustle and action. Bruin is afterrwards attacked by a tiny Circassian chief—meanhfor Schaayral—and is muzzled and led off chained, tnifcl£ to the delight of the audience. There is also a grandJfpano-ramiiic tableau, illustrative of the triumphs of the allied forcces in the Crimea, and companies of Lillputian heroes reprresent the British, French, and Russian forces. Our owna national airs, and " Partant pour la Syrie,” were loudly appldauded. “ God save the Queen,” was even enCWed. The3 pantomime had, as we began by saying, a decided success.?, and is, wejdoubt not, destined to a long career.?
‘Observer,’Dee. 31st.
“‘The pantomime at Drury-laiie Theatre on **boxing nighht ” was, as the readers of The Observer are aware, en-titleed Jack and Jill. The first scene presented an interior r view of the Hall of Hypochondria, Situated in the dorcmains of Dulness. The blue devils, named Fog and Briazsle, Taxes and Quarterday, Spleen and Indigestion,
wenre busy about a weird cauldron, in which they cooked mehlaiichoiy for the million. Their mistress, Misanthropy, roboed in black, and riding on a pale white horse, or else on her r own nightmare, came in, and exhorted Her servants to makke the world uncomfortable. The malicious iutention of t the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was exppressed, by the* entrance of her antagonist, Good Hu-mouur, of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant representa-tivee. She arrived by the “broad grinnage line” of railway/, in a car formed of a punch-bowl, and rolling on puddding wheels. This was characteristically enacted. The entertainment ended with a military trophy, surrounded by ' French and British soldiers, and with a martial song by Misiss Rosina Collins, attired bar a tivandiere, fend with sevveral loyal and patriotic airs of the two allied nations.”
' “ A pantomime at this theatre is no unimportant matter eitlther to the manager or the public." The former sees in it t a large amount of profit—the latter a large amount of enpjoyment; and essential, therefore, is it that it should he goiood and well enriched with the elements of diversion, phhysical and visual, upon which the fortunes of ft pantomime wholly depend. Mr. Smith has hitherto given plen-tififul proof that he is fully aware qf his responsibilities at thhis holiday juncture, and the Million/for whom: he so -
especially caters, have ratified his titles to consideration ass an entrepreneur in the fantastic: and spangjed worjd of buufibonery. His present effort is in no respect inferior to wkhat he has done upon former occasions. The vast theatre ov»ver which he presides is pre-eminently adapted for scenic displays, and for those peculiar transformations and sut-. pnrises which the juvenile eye loves to look upon. Aware off hi? advantages in the matter of, Space and machinery, aiand the opportunities that grow out of them, he Mi done him best to meet the exigencies of Christmas, and bis pftn-tonmime is ft triumph accordingly. It ift Very smart, very
bright, and very comic. Altogether, the pantomime reflects credit upon everybody concerned in it, especially Mr. Edward Stirling, the stage manager, under whose judicious care it has been produced, and we prophesy, without hesitation, its long continuance iu the bills.” *
‘Bell's Life,’ Dec. 31st

“The curtain rose upon the pantomime of Jack and Jill, by Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The first scene presented an interior view of the Hall of Hypochondria, situated in the domain of Dulness. The blue devils, named Fog and Drizzle, Taxes ' and Quarterday, Spleen and Indigestion, were busy about a weird cauldron, in which they cook melancholy for the million. Their mistress, Misanthropy, robed in black, and riding on a pale white horse, or else on her own nightmare, came in and exhorted her servants to make the world uncomfortable. The malicious intention of the sombre queen was counteracted, as soon as it was expressed, by the entrance of her antagonist, Good Humour—of whom Miss Arden was the pleasant representative. The harlequinade is full of allusion to the great and little events of the day. A bale of “ Manchester stuff,” containing a Quaker gentleman who brought in an obnoxious letter, was particularly noticeable. We had comforts for the Crimea, and a box of soldiers thence, who foughf to the discomfiture of the Russians. The entertainment ended with a military trophy surrounded by French and British soldiers, and with a martial song, by Miss Rosina Collins, attired as a vivandière, and with several loyal and patriotic airs of the two allied nations. It was a very brilliant and effective spectacle, and the pantomime is sure to.have a run.”
‘Illustrated London Mews.’ ,dT Dec. 30th.
“ As might have been expected from the extraordinary preparations so solicitously made, the pantomime at this theatre has met with remarkable succees : it is entitled “ Jack and Jill, or, Harlequin King Mustard and the Four-and-Twenty Blackbirds Baked in a Pie,” and is indebted for its highly-meretorioüs introduction to Mr. E. L. Blanchard. The plot is of course, founded, upon the
ancient nursery legends suggested by the title ; but the author has evidently employed them as the means of allegorising the art of cookery. The pantomime at this house may compete with the most gorgeous at any other.”
4 Sunday Times,’ Dec. 31st.
“It is the avowed policy of Mr. E. T. Smith to make Drury Lane the theatre of the people, and this object he has assuredly effected, if we may judge by the solid masses of spectators which were closely packed in every part of the house on Tuesday evening. Notwithstanding the number of the àudienee, unusual quietude prevailed, and the curtain drew up for the Christmas pantomime, Jack
mid Jill ; or Harlequin King Mustard and the Four-and-twenty Blackbirds Baked in a Pie. A full description of the mysteries of the introduction, and of the prominent points ip the fable, was given by us last week, and we trust it has made sufficient impression on our readers not to require reiteration. In respect to scenic adjuncts and splendour of costume, Mr. E. T. Smith has certainly, in the present instance, outdone all his previous exertions, the scenes of the transformation and the final tableau are more brilliant and fanciful than anything of the kind we have been accustomed to §ee on the stages such as that of Drury Lane ;
in fact, this may be cited as a rate instance of the grand
resources of the theatre being employed to the very best
advantage. The appearance of the locality in which the transformation is effected excited universal enthusiasm, and in obedience to a general call, Mr E. F. Smith bowed bis acknowledgments to the audience. All the incidents and accidents of the pantomime find a worthy and fitting termination in the illuminated page of the History of England, veliere juvenile English and French bands perform p triot ic melodies, andin the splendid Temple of Victory, upon which the green baize is loth to fall.”

" Times,” December 27th.
•* To have witnessed the holiday-making crowd which - thronged last night the precincts of Old Drury, one would 1 have thought the heart of England, whose pulse may be . , said to boat in this huge and overgrown metropolis of London, was intent on nothing but fun and frolic, could throb to nothing but the mimic gibe, see nothing but the clown’s grimace, applaud nothing but the evolutions of the nimble harlequin, sympathise with nothing but the misfortunes of poor battered pantaloon, chuckle at nothing hut the successful wi)es of grotesque buffoons and rogues when exercised at the cost of the more simple and matter-of-fact «- • muons of humanity. The truth is, that pantomime belongs to all times and circumstances ; that, whatever may be the 1. condition of things, there must be element for laughter in the d,eeds and appearances both of ourselves aud our neigh-r boqrs, and, in short, that it is not in the “ humane” creature to reach that standard at which all its “faits etjeste'ë” (as the old. Trench chroniclers and romanists say) are above reproach, and consequently unexposed to ridicule—-or, as f.r the ironical among poets term it, “ wholesome satire.’’ And thus, we gentlemen and plebeian of united Britain, although the actual moment is possibly one upon which hangs our future destiny as a political Power, if not abso-lately as a nation, can afford to laugh when seemingly it would far better befit us to weep, or at least to hold our breath with anxious suspense rather than our sides with overcoming' fits of hilarity. But so it is ; and so it will be, in' fill likelihood, when the 'hand that pens these lines ■has withered, and the existing generation has passed away. The pantomime, was the absorbing idea, not only with , the “ gods,” but with those who, being less than the ■“ gods” pay more—the occupants of the pit and boxes. At length the wished-for moment came. The orchestral prelude over;, t^e curtain was raised, to the general delight, upon the first scene, or tableau, of Jack and Gill, the “ new j. and entirely anginal and extraordinary and fantastic and t	culinaryx” and what not else, Christmas pantomime, which
- ' the. enterprising Mr. E. T. Smith had been for some weeks j:i‘ (hearing for his countless friends and patrons. “ An illuminated page in the history of England” and last and best, to A i a ^'aiid'dlfogorical tableau with panoramic effects, in which there is an imposing spectacle of the military a id patriotic kind, comprising allusions to the glorious battles of the
f -Crimea, distributions of military honours, and other such'mat-. tors, with “ God save the Queen,” “ Partant pour la Syrie,” aud “ Rule Britannia,” all contrived with unexceptionable wqc taste, and'finally culminating in a magnificent coup d'œil, .win. which were combined all imaginable splendours of variegated light failing upon scenes and objects of bright and ’ various colours, glittering spangles, and sparkling tinsel, ad 'infinitum, ’and'the really “ terrific” flight (if it were not accomplished with so little effort) of the Italian brothers as a climax. This display of gorgeous effect and ingenious ■	. contrivance was vociferously cheered, and the curtain fell
to applause so unanimous that the success of the pantomime was placed beyond a question.”

Morning Post,” Dec. 27th
J“ Th ■ new'Christmas pantomime, entitled “Jack and. Jill; or, Harlequin King Mustard, and the Four and Twenty jjhckbh'ds baked in a pie,” and may be described in general . terms.aS extraordionary, literary, traditionary, comic, gas-ti^onomical, and peculiarly .culinary, fantastical, domestic, The feats of 'agility are very extraordinary.
One Italian Brother takes‘a flight from the front of the . .theatre toothy stage, where he is joined by his brother, and th% both prim med on the suspended ropes. The allusions were numerous to the war; there were also a great many changes, and two excellent masks, one of Monsieur Juilien and the' other Soyer; The pantomime is full to overflowing of bristle and “ business,” and by no means deficient in loytfi'tjqAs the attdienefe had to rist, three-times to the national anthem, and twice to “ Partant pour la Syrie.” The last scene is. if possible, still more elegant aud magnificent, lxan that already alluded to. All up the sides of the stage are revolving and illuminated columns, and in the centre is
a Temple of Fame, which also revolves, in the niches of
which are splendidly attired allegorical females; to all this is added various coloured lights, producing au effect that defies description.”
“Morning Chronicle,” Deo. 27th.
“ It is no easy matter now-a-days to fill the spacious area of Drury-lane, but this feat was accomplished last night by Mr. E. T. Smith, the lessee of the theatre, by the promised attractions held out in his pantomime of Jack and Jill, or Harlequin King Mustard. The programme in the bills of the evening set forth a succession of jests that was irresistibly tempting, and we are bound to add that the performance did not belie the promises. The pantomime is to the full as diverting, funny, and extravagant as one would wish to see. The best critics of such pieces always are the young, and, tried by the test of their interest, the success of the pantomime was triumphant; the merry laughter of the children^ alternating with their shouts of delighted wonder, kept up a running commentary upon the whole performance. Upon the whole, the pantomime at Old Drury this year is fully equal to any of its predecessors, and we know not that a family, in search of amusement at that festive season will meet with it more readily than in witnessing the performance $ Jfick and Jill." ,
' - “Morning Herald,”
27th.
“ Large aa this theatre is, it was insufficient for the host of holiday visitors who. flocked to it Iasi; wight, attracted doubtless by the very attractive bill of pantomime fare put forth jjy the manager. Although a crowded house, and boxing-night, the gods were not so noisy as usual. Jack and Jill, or Harlequin King Mustard indfour^nd-Tutntg Blackbirds baked in a Pie, betrays in its title the incidents on which it is founded. First appeares Hypochondriac Hall, tenanted by blue devils, who, when the curtain rises, are gathered round a cauldron in a cave dismally blue, brewing melancholy for the million. They are interrupted by the arrival of Good Humour in a fairy gar, of which a wassail-bowl forms the body and plum-puddings the wheels, and'.are put to flight almost at her very.appearance, so hard is it for spleen and melancholy to abide the sight of good-nature and good-humour. There is also a grand panoramic tableau, illustrative of the triumphs of the allied forces in the Crimea, and companies of Lilliputian heroes , represent the British, French, and Russian forces. Our own national airs, and “ Pourfcant pour la Syrie,” were Iqudly applauded. V God save the Queen ” was even en-feored. Of the performers in the pantomime nothing can be said but what is to their praise. Besides some graceful dancing by Mdll®. Therese, and Annie Cushnie, and- Miss Smith, the Italian brothers astonished the audience by their wonderful performances. The scenery, is .daringly beautiful, and would alone be worth a visit,”

The extraordinary sticcess attained by the presenl lessee of this theatre seems only to stimulate him to redouble his efforts, and to expend en magnificent novelties the profits thus deservedly acquired. The pantomime he lias produced has. evidently had no expense spared upon it
and tha gorgeous scenery, the magnificent dresses, the innumerable, ingenious contrivances in the way of masks, tricks, and transformations, equal if, t^ej do not surpass, anything we recollect, even in tire, most glorious! days of pantomime. This species of entertainment seems to be again fully iu the ascendant, and to hdvfe reconquered the hold on the public taste whiçh burlesque " for ft tlri usurped. The causes why this should do thus it were tedious now to tell, but so it is; and tnere tnust be some strong affinities with our nature in this specie of entertainment, that confer on it a perennial attraction. In the comic portion the tranepareooiei illustrating the war are

It turns entirely on the elopement of Miss Fanny Bung (Miss Love) daughter of Mr. Peter Bung, host of the Fly and Flcwer Pot (Mr. Glindon). The hostelry is situat'd near a country railway station. Fanny elopes from it with Harry Sparkle, a young student (Mr. Lingham), and is immediately pursued by her father, assisted by Jack Corker, an officious person in the neighbourhood (Mr. G. Wild) who at the outset in the chase captures a Captain Loveduck, an effeminate young officer much addicted to betting (Mr. Hall) under the impression »hat this person was Fanny disguised in regimentals, borrowed from the wardrobe of the captain, who was a guest at the Fly and Flower Pot. Soon after the discovery of this mistake, the scene charges to Regent’s-park, where the runaway lovers, with Fanny’s assistant, Letty bar maid of Mr. Bung (Miss E. Arden) are found on the eve of the tying of the hymeneal knot-while Sparkle and Fanny depart for this purpose, Letty remains, and is soon accosted by Corker, who is come to Louden in pursuit. After a little flirtation between the two latter, in the course of which they give vent to their own hymeneal inclinations in a duet, which was encored, Sparkle and Misa Bung are found at the Hotel de l’Eté, whither they are traced by the lady’s father and Corker. I Thè father is quickly reconciled to the situation of affairs, and the whole terminates satisfactorily. As to the title of the piece, its only foundation is the) fact that the whole of .he parties having a stake on a forthcoming race, and having chosen what turn6 out to be the winner, while they are congratulating each other on the result, they perceive through a window of the hotel an announcement over the shutters of the betting-office from which their winnings were to be drawn, that the owner was “gene to the diggings to get the money.” The attendance was an average one, and the audience had a satisfied look.

L’ETOILE DU NORD.	S \
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,—However much I may disagree with some of the opinions expressed in your to-daj’a notioe of L’Etoile dit Lord. I have, you will say, no right to find fault with them. Granted; butlam sure that your well-known and undeviating adherence to the great maxim, “ Fiat Justxiia,” &«., will induce you to give publicity to the following short correction of your, no doubt unintentional misstatement of the facts.
In yonr criticism, you say that you think it was unfair toM. Meyerbeer to produce his operanotwithstanding his remonstrance. Now, Sir, when I tell you that Mr. Reynold* son, by my direction, offered M. Meyerbeer 600 guineas merely to come over and superintend the production of his opera, giving him carte blanche as to all engagements—In short, the whole and sole control of all arrangements connected with it, I think yon will aoqnit me on the charge of unfairness. M. Meyerbeer, inhisreply, “did not remonstrate," he merely said that he had otherwise disposed of his work m this oountry. The following are his exact words :—"Tont en vous remerciant, Monsieur, des termes flatteuses et aimables que contient votre lettre, de la confiance que vota voulez bien avoir dans la valeur de mon ouvrage, et des offres pecuniares que voub me faites, j’ai le regret de ne pas pouvoir me rendre à vos désir, car j’ai déjà disposé autrement de mon ouvrage pour l’Angleterre.” Now, I never asked H. Meyerbeer’s permission to play the opera, be cause I was always aware that I did not require it. Conseq aeutly, the above offer was made solely to secure the most efficient possible reading of his great work. As I said before, I will not attempt to combat the opinions advanoed or your criticism. The public must decide between us. They have judged, are judging, favourably ; they are gratified and satisfied, and of coarse I am gratified and satisfied too. Fair play, I ask no more—fair play for the players, vocal and instrumental. I have Tol-becque, Nadaud, Prospère, Barret, the Griesbachs, Mount, Psque, Mann, Ac., in that orchestra which you flagellate so unkindly.
Sincerely thanking you for the very flattering terms In which you have spoken of some parts of L’EUrdt du Nord,
I have the honour to remain, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
March 1. I'VSf_____________________E. T. SMITH.

FROM THE ‘‘TIIES" NEWSPAPER, MARCH i 1855.
The “ adaptation from Meyerbeer s Opera, L’Etoile du Nord,” produced at Drury Lane Theatre on Monday Night before a crowded house, with “ a blaze of triumphis simply a translation of M. Meyerbeer s libretto, combined with nearly the whole of the music, and placed upon the stage, in respect to scenery, costume, awi/ wie-chantcal contrivances, m a manner highly creditable to the management, which has fairly put forth all its resources. The English version, by Mr. Reynoldsoni an old and experienced hand, m gooiZ, and one or two of the tableaux are so effective■ we would especially cite the termination of the second act, where, after the Czar /¿as revealed himself to the conspirators, the armies assemble,	¿/¿e/r various Military Bands, vivan-
dieres,	presenting an imposing and magnificent coup d’ceil, that we were not surprised
at the enthusiastic applause of the audience and the general summons for Mr. Smith. In short, the L’ETOILE DU NORD is a grand spectacle, a theatrical portraiture of the events and paraphernalia of camps, accompanied by the din and movement, the bustling crowds, and motley variety of shapes and incidents that characterize the soldier s active life, we have nothing but the agreeable duty of recording a verdict of almost unqualified approval, and of signalizing the representation as a decided and well-earned success.

FROM TOR “TIES” NEWSPAPER, NARCO 1, 1855.
The “ adaptation from Meyerbeer s Opera, L’Etoil© dll MO?d/’ produced at Drury Lane Theatre on Monday Night before a crowded house, with “a blaze of triumphis simply a translation of M. Meyerbeer s librettor combined with nearly the whole of the music, and placed upon the stage, in respect to scenery, costume, and mechanical contrivances, in a manner highly creditable to the management, which has fairly put forth all its resQurces. The English version, by Mr. Reynoldson, an old and experienced hand, is good, and one or two of the tableaux are so effective} we woidd especially cite the termination of the second act, where, after the Czar has revealed himself to the conspirators, the armies assemble, with their various Military Bands, vivandier es, Sçc„ presenting an imposing and magnificent coup d'œil, that we were not surprised at the enthusiastic applause of the audience and the general summons for Mr. Smith. In short, the L'ETOILE DU NORD is a grand spectacle, a theatrical portraiture of the events and paraphernalia of camps, accompanied by the din and movement, the bustling crowds, and motley variety of shapes and incidents that characterize the soldier's active life, we have nothing but the agreeable duty of recording a verdict of almost unqualified approval} and of signalizing the representation as a decided and well-earned success.

j have the honour to announce that, in oouseuuenee of their Imperial Majesties the Emperor and Empress of the French having commanded that Madame and Signor Gassier should sing before them in Paris at the commencement of this week, the OPENING of the Present season at the Royal Opera is necessarily DEFERRED until Friday next, the I3th ini-t. ...	.	,
li'piiinrf of t(ip di)pra.
Thi action of this charming Lyric is laid in one of the romantic valleys of Switzerland. Bellini composed no set Overture for it; but, after a short and gracefully written Symphony, the curtail rises to a joyous Chorus of Villagers, which introduces the “ Tutto e gioja” by Lisa, who, with feelings of bitterness and jealousy, sees her friends and neighbours, headed by Alessio, assembling to celebrate the nuptials of Elvino and Amina. The exceedingly quaint and characteristic Wedding Song (“ In Elvezia non ha rosa”) having been sung beneath the window of the bride, Amina enters, and, in the Recitative, “ Cari compagni,” the charming Cantabile, “ Come per me,” and the brilliant Cabaletta, “ Sora il sen,” expresses her thanks for the kiia congratulations of her friends, and the unbounded joy which fills her heart. The notary then enters with the marriage contract, and, almost immediately afterwards, Elvino
appears. In a most expressive Andantino, “ Prostrato al marmo,” he relates that his delay has been occasioned by his offering up a prayer for their future happiness at his mother’s tomb. The lovers now give utterance to their mutual felicity in an exquisite Duo, “ Prendi l’anel ti dono,” ani the contract of betrothal is signed, when the crack of the postillion’s whip and the rattle of carriage-wheels announces an arrival of importance. Count* Rodolpho enters; he is desirous cf proceeding at once to the neighbouring castle; but, as the road is bad and evening coming oi, he determines to remain for the night at the village auberge, of which Lisa is the landlady. A Cavatina is here sung by the Count, of which the popular Andante Cantabile, “ Vi ravisso,” forms the opening movement. The celebrated Phantom Chorus, “A fosco cielo,” follows next; after which the Count enters the auberge, the villagers depart to their several homes, and the lovely Duo, “ Son geloso,’’ between Amina and Elvino, brings the first scene to a close.
Tie action of the second scene takes place in the Count’s sleeping apartment in the
auberge. Lisa’s coquettings with ftodolpho being suddenly interrupted by a strange and unlookedfor visitor, she hastily quits the room, leaving her shawl behind her. The much-talked of and much-dreaded phantom appears. It proves to be none other than Amina, who, in a state of somnambulism, is wandering round the village, and now enters the Count’s apartment through the window. He will not take advantage of her helpless situation, but touched vith her pure innocence and truthfulness, quits the room; and Amina, after a magnificent dream-clad musical embodiment of the nuptial ceremony which is so soon to unite her to Elvino, snks calmly and unconsciously on the couch which has been prepared for the Count’s repose. Morning dawns, and the villagers come with an address of congratulation to their newly-anived lord. Them surprise at finding a female in his chamber is interrupted by the return o;' Lisa, who, having observed Amina’s entrance through the vrindow, now brings Elvino te witness the dishonour of his betrothed bride, who, being at length awakened, is discarded and treated with contumely by all except her foster-mother, Teresa. The Quintetto, “ D’un pensiero,” which Bellini has written for this interesting situation, is exceedingly effective, affording great opportunity for the pathos of vocalisation; and the Stretta of the Finale, * Non e questa ingrata core,” is a masterly development of intense feeling.
The last Act commences with a Chorus of Villagers (“ Qui la selva”); they are on their way to tie Castle to beg the Count’s interference in behalf of Amina, who, after their departure, enters, aad is subjected to the reproaches of her heart-broken lover in the justly-renowned Cantabib “ Tutto e sciolto,” and the no less celebrated “ Ah! perche non posso odiarti.” The scene then changes, and, after a vain attempt by the Count to convince Elvino of the innocence of his betrothed bride, the last Finale commences with the sudden appearance of Amina walking in her sleep. She enters through an upper window in the roof of the mill-house, and passes along a frail, wooden bridge which spans the mill-wheel. Her lover is now convinced of the injustice of his suspicions, and his bride, at length restored to consciousness and joy. closes the opera with the “ Ah! non giunge”—a brilliant burst of rapturous delight.

The third season of the Royal Opera—which, though it has experienced some vicissitudes, has not been without its uses, and has done no little towards giving the public, at very reasonable prices, a tolerably good notion of the best works of the Italian and German sohoob —commenced last night, in presence of an audience that filled every part of the theatre.
The opera was La Sonnamhula, tung in Italian. The oroheBtra was under the able and zealous superintendence of Mr. Tolly, and there was a numerous and efficient chorus* ‘Theistar ofthaftvenin'g was, of course, the' pniuqldonw.

In the duet with Elvino, at the end of the first act, a little more sentiment would hare been desirable; and in the bedroom scene (Act II), where she is discovered by Elvino in the chamber of the Count, the passionate accents, to which we have been accustomed by the greatest dramatic singers, were not exactly there ; but in the whole of the last scene her vocalization was singularly effective; «<? the famous rondo't “Ah non giunge,” in which Madame Gassier went np to F in alt. with the utmost facility, and performed other remarkable feats, created a furore. She was encored unanimously, and recalled by the whole Mdse at the fall of the curtain.
The opera was otherwise wdlt performed. M. Gassier (a Frenchman—husband of thejuama donna) sang the music of Count Rodolpho admirably ; and Signor Bektini was a more than a respectable Etvmo. If the demonstrations of the audience, indeed, may be taken into account, a more unequivocal triumph was never achieved. The applau-a was incessant and uproarious. After the opera the band played “ God save the Queen,”and Partant pour la Syria” ; and the performances concluded with a diverti&eitiCnt, ia which the carps de ballet (all ladies) was by no means, indifferent. On the whole, the cheap prices taken into consideration, a more agreeable entertainment Could scarcely have been provided.

MEMOIR OF MDE- GASSIER.
MADE- GASSIER, who is a native of Madrid, and a grand-daughter of the renowned Spanish actor, Don Pedro Cubas, commenced her musical studies at an
unusually early age, and gave promise of such great vocal talent, that she was sent to Italy to complete her education in the justly celebrated schools of Milan. After that severe course of study and voicing, without which no artiste can attain permanent eminence, she made her first appearance in 1847-8, with her husband, Signor Gassier, at the Teatro Carolino, Palermo. From thence she went, in the following autumn, to the Teatro Canno-biano, at Milan, and created so great a sensation among the cognoscienti, that the manager of “ La Scala ” secured her services for the following carnival at the Imperial Opera. Made- Gassier’s success in Milan necessarily brought several eligible professional offers, and, from among them, she elected to accept the proposals of the Impressario of the Teatro Carlo Felice (Genoa), for the Carnivals 1849 and 1850. The impression which she made in that city, especially by her voicing of the far-famed Valse, which was written expressly to shew her unrivalled
command of Jiorituri, led to an engagement for the ensuing spring on condition that a new opera should be composed for the occasion. This task was entrusted to
the young Maestro Cagnoni, author of “ Don Bucefalo,” who came to Genoa, and there wrote the “ Amore e Trappole,” for the gifted subject of our Memoir.
From Genoa Madc- Gassier was called to Venice, where, for an entire season, she alone sustained every rôle in the répertoire, and there Frederico Ricci wrote for her his opera, “ I Due ritratti.”
Afterwards Mad6, Gassier returned to Spain, and appeared with great eclat at Madrid, Seville, Barcelona, and Cadiz ;— and ultimately, tempted by the brilliant offers of the Director of the Imperial Opera of Paris, she last season appeared there in “ II Barbiere di Sivigi.ia ” (Rosina) with immense success, and from thence transfers her services to the Royal Opera, Drury Lane.
To conclude, Madame Gassier sang in •£ II Barbiere di Siviglia ” for thirty-six successive nights in Milan, and was for four years a pupil of Rossini.

/' ~ _
For something like a year and a half the Théâtre de la Gaieté, aa it proudly to vera above the smaller fry of theatres' on the Boulevard du Temple, has been observed to diaplaly upon its broad fiont a trauspaneney representing a terrified Cossack flying frim- a pertinacious dog. The appearance of-this picture demted that the performance of Les Odaaquer was going on within.
Novelties havi, indeed; been produced' at the Gaietésinca the 24th of Novimber, lS63i when- this literally immortal
work of MM. Abhonse Arnault and "Louis Judicis was first ■ «en by lampligit ; but the interruptions occasioned by ephemeral creatbns have been to3-elightto lessen the permanent charaetîr of Le» Cetaqy.es-. The picture of tha dog and the Cabnuek, though now and then pnt away for a few weeks, wai soon to be fetched baok from-its-hiding. place, furbished up anew, and fastened over the entrance to the Gaieté mire lustrous and-more imposing than ever.
So interminable seemed the. “ run” of Les Cosaques that its very longevity became an élément of attraction. Just as old Parr was t greater curiosity than a new-born infant, so a drama tbatadhered with such tenacity- to tbe boards was more invitiig than a novelty. The dramatic journalists began to take arithmetical notea of its progress, in which process they were kindly assisted1 by the theatre itself, for a figure denoting the age that Lee. Cosaques had attained was added to ths transparency, and, if we remember right, the 100th night was solemnized by -an illumination. Last week it attainedits 200th night,.and it shows no-signs of dying yet. Possibly the people on the 3hulevard.-iu»y begin to date time iron the first appearance of-that Hying Cossack, as the Mahomeians date &om the flight of the prophet, or the inhabitants rf Piccadilly from-Mr. Albert Smith's Ascent of Mont Blanc.
_ Let it not be imagined from all! this- that- Iris Cosaques is a El tracie of dramatic genius, It is nothing, of the sort. Far from being a good specimen of the modern French drama, it less resembles the pieoes ordinarily brought oat at theGaietéthanlhosewhioh form the staple commodity at tha Anoien Cirque. In other words, it may be compared to an Astley’spiece wth the horses omitted, and when Mr. W. Cooke cut two hours from its length and brought it out at Astley’s, in the course of last year, he by.nomeans took it to an improper region;
At tha same lime, au a pieceappealing.-tBcw to a national feeling than to Ihe interest normally taken in a dramatic entertainment, tes Cosaques ■ possesses ecnsiderable merit. The Btory of a blind mother and daughter who fall into the
-	hands of a Cosack hetman^ who would marry the young . lady against hai will, and demolish the -hopes of a better
man than him-df is notethe most riveting, nor does it gain a great? deal iron the introduction of a strong- willed woman —a Biave, at firit devoted to her wicked master, and afterwards appearins; as tha protectress of oppressed virtue. It is by the colisión of masses representing nations, and not by _ the firtunes of individuals,, that Les Cosaques hae attained iti popularity, and in.,riming and working these collisioni the authors have shown great skill. The scene is hid ia Champagne, at the time of the Kurman occupation, immediately before the “hundred days;” and a, the Cossacks thus appear as the oppressors, .while the FreDch are the oppressed, a good strong feel1 n; of national hatred i& at ooca established, and is constantly
-	kept alive by vsriouâincidents of petty tyranny which tha authors have leer at painato sprinkle over the entire action. Again, if there are any tv* things popular with a Parisian crowc tinao are an émeute* and a cafe chantant* Wbat therefore most be the effect of a riot in a co/á chantant] Th, Cessaoks, beings hateful throughout, are wisely made mere hateful, than- over, when they ascisi at

- ,p<>YAL OPERA, DRURY-LANB. /^LT
The favourable impression produced by .Madame Gassier at the opening of the season, in the part of Amina, was ratified on Monday night by her performance of Bosina in II Barbiere di Sivigiia, which is better suited to her both as an actress and a singer. The warm reception with which she was greeted in this character by the Parisian audience of the Théâtre des Italiens was readily explained by so brilliant a display. As a singer of bravura Madame Gassier may lay claim to a distinguished rank, while the freshness of her voice and the ringing quality of its upper tones give an additional charm to her moBt daring achievements—a charm, moreover, derived from the conviction that whatever she attempts is sure to be effected with perfect ease. In the cavatina, “ Una voce poco fa,” and in the duet with Figaro, “Dunque io son,” Madame Gassier, like the ms-iority of modern singers, introduced a profusion of ornaments and changes, passages of “staccato,” ko., which we cannot regard as improvements on the text of Bossini, but these were accomplished with admirable facility and a certain grace, resulting from the freedom andself-possesBion only to be acquired through arduous and well-directedstudy. Inthe leBSon &ceueMadameGasBier interpolated, according totradi-tionalcuBtom, a morceau (I occasion of her own choosing. This was a slow movement and rondo “à la raise,” with which Madame Bosio had already made tbe operatic pnblic acquainted. It ia a remarkably showy composition of its class, and Madame Gassier, who siDgs it in a fashion peculiar to herself, knows how to make the most of it. Here the flexibility and clearness of the higher register of her voice were exhibited to the greatest advantage, and her execution, in more than one respect, was as surprising as it was satisfactory. She was encored in a storm of plaudits, and repeated the valse movement with undiminished effect. The trio in thelast scene we liked less. The ornaments were all well executed ; and there was a C in aIt. that would have atoned for a multitude of unwarrantable liberties ; but the flowing and elegant melody of the first movement is for preferable as it stands in tbe score ; and really, now and then at least, we think Bossini might be allowed to speak for himself. We are aware that the music of Bosina is suited to a mezzo soprano ; and for this reason, that such singers as Grisi and Alboni are able to render it effective with few or no alterations, while a high soprano, as a measure of selfdefence, is in a great d-gree obliged to have recourse to them —after the example of Persian!. But there should be moderation in all things ; and tbe stanchest adherent of the florid sobool can hardly feel otherwise than gratified at having an occasional phrase of ench genuine vocal melody as that of Bossini delivered precisely as it was written by tbe composer.
The other characters were more ot less well represented. M. Gassier, though nimble and restless, is not exactly the volatile and amusing barber to which Bonconi, the prince of Figaros, has accustomed us. He bas neither the physiognomy nor the physique for the part. Nevertheless, he is intelligent, alwaje “<» scène.” and sings invariably like a thorough musician. Signor Bettini would do better as the Count if he made fewer attempts to be funny. He forgets that Almaviva ia a n -blernan, not a buffoon, and that, even were his drunkenness real,' instead of feigned, he could never bo far forget himself as to act in such an outrageous manner—and in presence, too, of the lady of his choice. Some of the music, however, was very well sung by Signor Bettini, whose voice, though small, is by no means without what the French term “distinctionIn the parts of Bartolo and Basilio Signors Susini and Fortini {both from the Royal Italian Op-ra) exerted themselves zealously. The former sang the fine air, “ La Calunnia,” with real spirit, although with an excess of gesticulation and motion to and fro not absolutely required. The latter restored the song in _ which Dr. Bartolo reproaches his young and supple ward— | so often and unnecessarily omitted. Both were applauded,
' The last movement of the trio abovementioned—the well-known “ Zitti-Zitti” —was admirably sang by Madame Gassier, Signor Bettini, and M. Gassier, and tbe unanimous encore that followed was amply merited. The audience were delighted with the performance from first to last ; and, indeed, it was one of the best ever provided at the Boyal Optra. The Btage manager, however, ihould take care, in future representations, that, while the music in the orchestra is describing the lull of the elements, the storm behind the Fcenes does not rage louder than ever —which was the c-ise last night. The house was crammed to the ceiling ; and we were more convinced than ever that, with judicious management, an opera at cheap prices— whether Italian, German, French, or English—might be made a profitable speculation.

Extract from the Criticism in ‘The Times,” of Monday
(yesterday), April 23rd.
For somtthiug like a year and a half the Théâtre de la Gaieté, as it proudly towers above the smaller fry of . theatres on the Boulevard du Temple, has been observed to dsplay upon its broad front a transparency representing a terrified Cossack flying from a pertinacious dog The appearance of this picture denoted that the pîrformance of Les Cosaques was going on within.
Novelties have, indeed, been produced at the Gaieté since the 2-th of November, 1853, when this literally immortal work of MM. Alphonso Arnault and Louis Judicis was first seen by lamplight; but the interruptions ociasioned by ephemeral creations have been too slight to lessen the permanent character of Les Cosaques
So interninable seemed the “run,” that its very longevity teearne an element of attraction. The dramatic journalists began to take arithmetical notes of its prognss, in which process they were kindly assisted by the theatre itself for a figure denoting the age that Let Cosaques bad attained was added to the transparency and, if we remember right, the 100th night was solemnized by an illumination. Last week it attained its 200tk night, and it shows no signs of dying yet. Possibly the people on the Boulevard may begin to dale time from the first appearance of that flying Cossatk, as the Mahometans date from the flight of the proplet, or the inhabitants of Piccadilly from Mr. Albert Smith’s Ascent of Mont Blanc.
It is by tie collision of masses representing nations, and not by tie fortunes of individuals, that Les Cosaques lias attained its popularity, and in timing and working these collisions the authors have shown great skill. The scene is laid in Champagne, at the time of the Russian occupation, immediately before the “ hundred days”; and no thing can be more exciting than to see the. French portion of the audience rise en masse against the Muscovite intruders, heap up the tables and benches into a respectable barricade, and fairly beat
the enemy. The emeute, which is capitally contrived, has been alvays talked of as the grand “ effect ” of
Les Cosaques
Another cement of popularity is to be found in the
two comie parts, admirably played by MM. Paul Menier and Alexandre. The first of these is a veteran sergeant, who, in a series of plots against the Russians, is forced to put on the most outrageous disguises and exert the greatest measure of astuteness, yet through all his movemeuts preserves a military stiffness that nothing can subdue. The other is a soldier with a strong Champenois dialect, who is the constant companion of the veteran, and whose unpremeditated oddities come out strikingly in contrast with the more formal enunciations of his elder friend. So popular did Sergeant Duriveau and Jean Panel (as these characters are called) become in Paris, that when, after the production of Les Cosaques, a military spectacle entitled
Constantinople was brought out at the Ancien Cirque, the fortunes of these gentlemen were further continued in the new piece.
The company of the Gaieté has taken London completely by surprise. After a very short preparatory notice it has established itself for a limited term, on the boards of Drury-lane Theatre, and on Saturday performed the immortal drama of Les Cosaques in the presence of a numerous audience. It is said that these aiüsts only arrived on Friday, but, be that as it may, there they all were, in good working condition, on Saturday evening. There was Madame Lambquin, who has so often drawn tears as an afflicted mother ; there was the grandiloquent M. Gouzet; there was
Madame Leontine, whose entrance was always a signal of mirth at her own theatre ; there were MM. Paul Menier and Alexandre, in the parts by which they have gained so much glory—there, in fact, was the Théâtre de la Gaité, which had been wafted through the air like Aladdin's palace, and had comfortably settled down in the neighbourhood of the Strand.
The performance of Les Cosaques is to take place on alternate nights with the opera at Drury-lane. The acting of MM. Paul Menier and Alexandre will repay all who visit the theatre for the sake of histrionic art,
and a good opportunity is offered for wiping off all re-memberance of the wrong that was committed against the company of the Théâtre Historique when it appeared at Dx-ury-lane in 1848.

The first of these is a veteran sergeant, who, iii a series of plots against the Russians, is forced to put on the most outrageous disguises and exert the greatest measure of astuteness, yet through all his movements preserves a military stiffness that nothing can subdue. The other is a soldier with a strong Champenois dialect, who is the constant companion of the veteran, and whose unpremeditated oddities come out strikingly in contrast with the more formal enunciations of his elder Mend. So popular did Sergeant Duriveau and Jean Panel (as these characters are called) become in Paris, that when, after the production of Les Cosaques, a military spectacle entitled Constantinople was brought out at the Ancien Cirque, the fortunes of these gentlemen were further continued in the new piece.
The company of the Gaieté has taken London completely by surprise. After a very short preparatory
notice it has established itself for a limited term, on the boards of Drttry-lane Théâtre, and on Saturday performed the immortal drama of Les Cosaques in the presence of a numerous Audience. It is said that these artists only arrived on Friday, but, be that as it may, there they all were, in good working condition, on Saturday evening. There was Madame Lambquin, who has so often drawn tears as an afflicted mother ; there was the grandiloquent M. Gouzet; there was Madame Leontine, whose entrance was always a signal of mirth at her own theatre ; there were MM. Paul Menier and Alexandre, in the parts by which they have gained so much glory—there, in fact, was the Théâtre de la Gaité, which had been wafted through the air like Aladdin’s palace, and had comfortably settled down in the neighbourhood of the Strand.
The performance of Les Cosaques is to take place on alternate nights with the opera at Drury-lane. The acting of MM. Paul Menier and Alexandre will repay all who visit the theatre for the sake of histrionic art, and a good opportunity is offered for wiping off all remembrance of the wrong that was committed against the company of the Théâtre Historique when it appeared at Drury-lane in 1848.

MEMOIR OF MDE- CASSIER.
MAD35- GASSIER, who is a native of Madrid, and a grand-daughter of the renowned Spanish actor, Don Pedro Cuhas, commenced her musical studies at an unusually early age, and gave promise of such great vocal talent, that she was sent ' to Italy to complete her education in the justly celebrated schools of Milan. After that severe course of study and voicing, without which no artiste can attain permanent eminence, she made her first appearance in 1847-8, with her husband, Signor Gassier, at the Teatro Carolino, Palermo. From thence she went, in the following autumn, to the Teatro Cqn.no-biano, at Milan, and created so great a sensation among the cognoscienti, that the manager of “ La Scala ” secured her
_	. t
services for the following carnival at the Imperial Opera. Made- Gassier’s success in Milan necessarily brought several eligible professional offers, and, from
among them, she elected to accept the proposals of the Impressario of the Teatro Carlo Felice (Genoa), for the Carnivals 1849 and 1850. The impression which she made in that city, especially by her voicing of the far-famed Valse, which was written expressly to shew her unrivalled
command of fiorituri, led to an engagement for the ensuing spring on condition that a new opera should be composed for the occasion. This task was entrusted to the young Maestro Cagnoni, author of “Don Bucefalo,” who came to Genoa, and there wrote the “Amore e Trappole,” for the gifted subject of our Memoir.
From Genoa Made; Gassier was called to Venice, where, for an entire season, she alone sustained every rôle in the répertoire,
and there Frederico Ricci wrote for her his opera, “ I Due ritratti.”
Afterwards Madc Gassier returned to Spain, and appeared with great éclat at Madrid, Seville, Barcelona, and Cadiz ;— and ultimately, tempted by the brilliant, offers of the Director of the Imperial Opera of Paris, she last season appeared there in
“ II Barbiere di Siviglia ” (Rosina) with immense success, and from thence transfers
her services to the Royal Opera, Drury Lane.
To conclude, Madame Gassier sang in “In Barbiere di Siviglta” for thirty-six . successive nights in Milan, and was for four years a pupil of Rossini.

ARGUMENT OF THE OPERA.

The action of this charming Lyric is laid in one of the romantic valleys of Switzerland. Bellini composed no set Overture for it; but, after a short and gracefully written Symphony, the curtain Uses to a joyous Chorus of Villagers, which introduces the “ Tutto c gioja ” by Lisa, who, with feelings of bitterness and jealousy, sees her ftiends and neighbours, Headed by Alessio, assembling to celebrate the nuptials of Elvino and A-miua. The exceedingly quaint and characteristic Wedding Song (“ In Elvezia non v’ha rosa”) having been sung, beneath the window of the bride, Amina enters, and, in the Recitative, “ Cari campagni,” the charming Cantabile, “ Come per me,” and the brilliant Cabaletta, “ Sovra ii sen” expresses her thanks for the kind congratulations of her friends, and the unbounded joy which fills her heart. The notary then enters With the marriage contract, and, almost immediately afterwards, Elvino appears. In a most expressive Andantino, “ Prostrato al rnarmo,” he relates that his delay has been occasioned by his offering up a prayer for their future happiness at his, mother’s tomb. The lovers iioav give utterance to their mutual felicity in an exquisite Duo, “ Prendi Xartel ti dono,” and the contract of betrothal is signed, when the crack of the postillion’s Avhip and the rattle of carnage-wheels «©noune^ an grrival of importance^ Count Rodolpho enters; he is des$fe$te of pf(> ’	'	'	'* :

A Cavatina is here sung by the Count, of which tne popular Andante (jantaoile, “ Vi ravisso,” forms the opening movement.- The celebrated Phantom Chorus, “ví fosco cielo,” follows next ; after Avliich the Count enters- the auberge, the villagers depart to their several homes, and the lovely Duo, “ Son geloso,” between Amina and Elvino, brings the first scene to a close.	‘	• *	• ■	* •	• •
_ The action of the second scene takes place in -the Count’s sleeping apartment iri the auberge. Lisa’s coquettings ivitli Rodolpho being suddenly interrupted by a strange and unlooked-for'visitor, she hastily quits the room, leaving her shawl behind her. The much-talked of and much-dreaded phantom appears. It proves to he none other than Amina, who, in a state of somnambulism, is wandering round the village, and now enters the Count’s apartment through the Avindow. He Avili not take advantage of her helpless situation, but touched with her pure innocence and truthfulness, quits the room ; and Amina, after a magnificent dream-clad musical embodiment of the nuptial ceremony which is so soon to unite her to Elvino, sinks calmly and unconsciously on the coûch which has been prepared for the Count’s repose. Morning dawns, and the villagers come with an address of congratulation to their, newly-arrived lord. Their surprise at finding a female in his chamber is interrupted by the retutn of Lisa, ivho, having observed Amina’s entrance through the window, no# brings Elvino to witness the dishonour of his betrothed bride, who, being at length awakened, is discarded and treated Avith. contumely by all except her foster-mother, Teresa. The Quintette, “ D’nn pensiero,” Avhich Bellini has written for this interesting situation, is exceedingly effective, affording great opportunity for the pathos of vocalisation ; and the Stretta of the Filiale, “ Non ê questa ingrata core,” is a masterly development of intense feeling.
The last* Act commencés with’a Chofins of Villagers (“ Qui l'a seUd") ; they áre on their way to the Castle to beg the Count’s interference in behalf of Amina, who, after their departure, enters, and is subjected to the reproaches of her heart-broken lover in the justly-renowned Cantabile “ Tutto è sciolto,” and the no less celebrated “ Ah ! perche non posso odiarti.” The « scene then changes, and, after a vain attempt by the Count to convince Elvino of the innocence of his betrothed bride, the last Finale commences with the sudden appearance of Amina walking in her sleep. She enters through an upper window in the roof of the mill-house, and passes along a frail, wooden bridge Avhich spans the mill-wheel. Her lover is noAv convinced of the injustice of his suspicions, and hxs bride, at length restored to consciousness and joy, closes the opera with the “ Ah ! non giunge”—& brilliant burst of rapturous delight.

ARGUMENT OF THE DRAMA OF “LES COSAQUES.”
The action of this piece takes place in 1814, at Troyes. The opening scene, Marion’s Canteen, introduces us to Plantureau and Montonnet, whose conversation concerning certain Cossacks who have been mysteriously killed and stripped of their uniforms, is interrupted by the entrance of Kro-katchcoff and two of his comrades. They are almost immediately followed by Duri-veau, Panel, and other French soldiers in disguise; a dispute arises about the sign over the door of the canteen, and the Cossack exits, threatening to report the impertinent landlady at head-quarters. Duriveau now gives Marion a bundle, and producing two swords from under his great coat, conceals them beneath the comptoir. The Cossack rushes back in affright, followed by Duriveau’s dog, who, like his master, seems to entertain an inveterate hatred for all Russians. A quarrel speedily ensues, and both parties exit to decide their differences with the sword. Maurice now enters, and from his conversation with Marion and Mdme Blanchard, we learn that this latter lady has unfortunately lost her sight; that her husband was killed during the retreat from Russia, and that when she was rescued from death by a certain Count. Manzaroff, who now holds the command in Troyes, her daughter Louise disappeared, and has not since been heard of. Her attendant, Olga, is looked on with suspicion by Maurice, who denounces Manzaroff as a treacherous villain ; Duriveau, Panel, and others enter; the former handing to Marion another bundle, which he informs her makes the eleventh. After a song by Rosalba, a funeral march is-heard. The French compel the Cossacks to uncover, and kneel as the remains of a deceased French general are borne past the window. Then closes the First Act. The next scene takes place in Manzaroff’s Hotel. We here discover that Olga has been placed
by the Count in Madame Blanchard’s service as a spy, and that Louise is not dead, but in Manzaroff’s power. Maurice attempts to rescue her, but fails, and is on the point of being assassinated, when Duriveau and Panel, rushing in through the window, the tables are turned, and the Count is for'the moment foiled. At the commencement of the next scene, Mad0, Blanchard is informed that her daughter is living—and, at its close, a meeting of c< n-spirators takes place; they are plotting to drive the Russians out of the city. The fourth and fifth Tableau introduce us to the celebrated Café de la Victoire, in which a quarrel again takes place between the Cossacks and French, and a terrific mêlée is the result. In the sixth scene (the Cossack**’ Camp) we find Duriveau and Panel, disguised as women, endeavouring, in conjunction with Marion, to effect the rescue of Maurice, and also of Louise, who has, however, promised to marry Manzaroff, on condition that the commandant be set at liberty.
The Fifth Act commences with the restoration of Louise to her mother’s arms ; but she again falls into Manzaroff’s power, together with Olga, who, having repented of heir treachery to her mistress, is now doomed to undergo the punishment of the knout for her treachery to her master.
In the last scene, Maurice, having been condemned to death, is led out to be shot ; but the firing party suddenly present their muskets at Manzaroff, who falls dead. This firing party consists of * Duriveau, Panel, and other French soldiers disguised as Cossacks. The sound of cannon in-the distance now proclaims that the French army is rapidly advancing on Troyes; the Russians take to flight—Maurice and Louise are united—and the curtain falls amid cries of “ Vive VEmpereur."

DRURY-LAKE THEATRE.
. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,—The alarm of fire on Wednesday evening, during: the performance of the Sonnambuta, was raised without any foundation. Nothing took place in the theatre to warrant! it, and how the report got circulated remains a mystery.
No theatre in Europe has such facilities of egress, so that; in case of fire the whole audience can escape in a few minutes. Three firemen are always in attendance, and Mr. Smith, the lessee, canses all the means of exit to be pro* pared previous to the commencement of the performance.
Those ladies and gentlemen who were preparing to leava the theatre immediately returned to their places, and' remained during the evening, perfectly satisfied with Mr, Smith’s explanation.
I am. Sir, your obedient servant,

ALARM OF TIRE AT UfiDRY-LANE XHEATBE.— During the performance of La SonnamLuia last night at Dmry-lane Theatre an alarm of fire was caused by a gentleman in the boxes, who fancied he saw smoke arising from a part of the proscenium. A great many of the audience rushed out of the theatre, ana the crush at the doors was so great that it was feared some fatal result would have occurred from the pressure ; fortunately, no accidents happened, and the alarm proved a false one. Mr. Stirling, the stage manager, came forward on the stage, and assured those who remained that there was no cause to be alarmed, and Mr. Smith, the lessee, gave the same assurance from
one of the private boxes. Order was in consequence after a short time restored, and the performance Droceeded.

THE PLOT
First, how Citesby wished to save: Moiteagle from au airy grave. How, before their coming quarrels: Fawkes and Catesby paced the barrels. (Not of the Lynn or Yarmouth School: but kindly lent by Mr. Rule,) because Guy Fa vkes declared that century : should see the first Train Parliamentary. How, whilst Fawkes sought his evening beer : Monteagle came in feeble fear. And how by Citesby being chidden : was by him ’neath the barrels nidebn. How, in a serious long palaver: Fawkes found that Catesby seemed to waver. How each determined, in a duel: the other should procure his gruel; (A “Desperate Combat’ of the age: when Hicks adorned tie Surrey Stage;) How, beaten, Fawkes essay’d to bolt: but was restrain’d by Catesby’s “Colt." How Astaroti claimed Fawkes, and seized him: aud how a fairy good releas’d him. And how, amidst recrimination : they all came to the
transformation.
Lest they escape from Memory’s cells: we name again those Active Swells :

Barber,	...	...	Mr. RYPOPHAGON.
How Columbine and Harlequin: the Pantomimic “ Trips” begin; and now the Clown and Panta’oon: upon their heels are followiig soon. How very badly they behave : and ’gainst his will the Daudy shave. The Harlequin is ki'leI outight: the Clown is in a dreadful fright. Then comes a scene of war and bustle: worthy the pen of William Ruseli. And wounds and blows are freely dealt: in what is called the “Spill and Pelt.”
SCENE III.

Maids of AU Work	...	...	Miss TRUNDLE and Miss TIDY.
How Pant doon and Clcvu, in sport: the servant-maids commence to court. A game of Cribbage now begins : Clown always most unf.irly wins. How then our much-loved friends are got: the warming-pan and poker hot. They go to bed pit out the light: and pass a most uneasy night. J3y Harlequin, whom they have killed the room witt dreadful ghosts is filled: in each of whom, the eye will greet; a Corsican from
Oxford Street.
SCENE IV.
BE L G R A V E SQUARE.
(OR ANY WHERE ELSE YOU PLEASE.)
The Dandy out a-shocting goes: but ignorance of sporting shows. The Clown meets a potato-man: and hides Poor Pussy in hiscau. Harlequin dressed as Dumilatre : now figures in a Pas de Quatre. The Clown and Pantaloon are presait: and Fludyer Norwood as a peasant. And here our Clown will do liis best: to sing “HOT CODL1NS,” like the rest.
SCENE V.
EPSOM ©0W$S.
(AND VERY LIKE THEM.)J
Though the crowd’s drss low breeding tells: yet some of them are really Swells. We now endeavour to get through: what each iniis own case can do. Columbine with her twinkling feet: Perea Nena tries to beat. Next, from his cart, Ceap Jack advauces: and Harlequin a Hornpipe dances. M. LE GRAND now nimbly
dances: upon
THE TIGHT ROPE,
and entrances : an eage* and admiring crowd: who their delight express aloud. Our Juggler next a basin takes: and with a peacock's feather makes: a series <-f uncommon feats: as good as those done in the streets; whilst three young Nickers draw out tones; uncommonly like Pell’s, from bones. The Thimble-Riggers do the
flats: aud next appear

\OYAL OPERA, DRURY-LANB.
/CPS'
Don Paquale was represented last night, for the first time, by tie company at this theatre, and with complete success. True, there" was no inimitable old bachelor, Uke Lablache—no pink of family physicians, like Tambnrini— and no ¡resistible lover, like Mario ; but in the parts of Don Pasqiale, Doctor HalateBta, and Ernesto, Signors Suaini, Gseier, and Bettini were far beyond respectable (Signor Gtssier more especially). These ventlemen displayed, inleed, eo familiar an acquaintance with the music ana all th» stage traditions, and oo-operated so efficiently in the morcetux d'ensemble, that it would be unfair to criticise them becaise they are not what our allies, on the other side of the Clianr.il, denominate “[artistes Itorsligne.” The melodious and cleveiy wriiten qnartet for “ principals”—at the end of Act 2—ws remarkably well sung and encored. The same complimeit was paid to Signor Bettini, in the wellknown serenade aid chorus behind the scenes which Ernesto gets np in his nistresa’s honour; and the lively duet, where Don Pasqnale unbosoms himself to Malateeta, won hearty applause hr Signors Susini and Gassier.
Madann Gassier’s Norina would stand in need of no apology a( any'theatre. The exceptional talent detected in this lady tom the first seems to develops itself, together with her peculiarities, in each new character. Her acting last night was ixtremely natural, to say nothing of its archness and spirit. Ikr singing throughout was artistic and finished. There is nit so much room for the exhibition of mere vocal facility inthe music of Norina as in that of the other two parts in vhich Madame Gassier has been heard at Drury-lane The dr e; but the scene where the animated youDg widow tosnents and perplexes Don Pasqnale, until ho is too deliglted to be rid of her, is amply calculated to test the resounes of a real dramatic singer ; and in this Madame Gassier ajpeared to very great advantage. A little mire movement and impetuosity would perhaps have been desirable jus here ; though, as Signor Susini was unaccountably torpii, considering the vexations he has to endure from his inaginary spouse, it was not easy to make any strong shiw of vivaoity in his presence. In the garden duet, which is (f a more sentimental colour, Madame Gassier Bang with the itmost taste and feeling; while Signor Bettini, as inthe preeding serenade, at intervals was slightly out of tune. It was enored ud repeated. The rondo finale, however, w as the decided “ h* of the evening—a fact the more noticeable, since sane singers, regarding it as ineffective, are apt to substitute another bravura of Donizetti’s in its place. Madame Gassier nevertheless rendered it exceedingly effective ly the neatness and point of Tier execution and the brilliant }oritwre with which she embellished it, including the trillo she dwells on with such ease, original “ staccato” passages mtirely her own, and that special high note, to attain wlich sometimes Bhe contrives the most ingenious expedient. This performance ra;sed the audience to enthusiasm, anl Madame Gassier, being loudly summoned, osme forward with her three companions amid unanimous plaudits. The house was very crowded.
1>0*AL OPERA,	DRURY-LANK—The
XV Directors l\p,ve the honour to announce, that in col sequence of the brilliant reception accorded to Madame Gassier in the rftie of Noina, Donizetti's opera, DON PASQUALK, will be repeated THIS EVENING.

DRURY-LANE THEATRE.
/J>fi

The gentlemen of the Fieldbg Club, who immortalized themselves by the extraordinary feat of performing an amateur pantomime at the Olympic, arrived at the culminating period of their glory last night. The fame of their achievements had reached the ear of Royalty itself, and they were requested to play in the presence of Her Majesty on the
uroad stage of old Drury.
The house presented & inost brilliant appearance. That large salle, which the greatest enterprise and talent have so often failed to fill, was crowded to repletion, and, as the audience was only admitted by high-priced tickets, every part looked as gay and fashionable as a dress-circle. Nor did even the huge throng there assembled represent any* thing like the number who desired to see the famous pantomime of Guy Fawkes. Those who had applied in vain for tickets were, we understand, nearly as numerous as those
who had been successful.
Her Majesty, Prince Albert, and the Royal children took their seats in the Boyal box shortly before the performance, which commenced with Mr. Planohfi’s Romantic Idea. Represented at the Lyceum by Mr. Charles Mathews and the company which was under his rule some half-dozen years ago this piece used to be agreeable enough, but the ama-teuiB of the Fielding do not distinguish themselves nearly so much in comedy as in pantomime, and consequently the introductory piece proved rather a dull affair. The pantomime itself is so very long that it might reasonably furnish an evening’s entertainment, without any preface whatsoever beyond Mr. Taylor’s prologue. We have already spoken bo largely on the subject of Harlequin Guy Patches, that we need only remind our readers of the agility of the Harlequin, the humour (now, alas ! a rare quality) of Mr. 3. Robins’s Clown, of the business-like decrepitude of Mr. Arthur Smith’s Pantaloon, of the grotesque perfection of Mr. Holmes’s Guy Fawkes, of the ease and vivacity of Mr. Albert Smith's Catesby, and then add, byway of a supplementary remark, that the several performers perfectly maintained themselves at the very high level they had established at the Olympic. Prophets of evil had hinted that an enlarged stage would bring with it a corresponding enlargement of difficulties; but, whether this was the case or not, the difficulties, if any, were admirably surmounted, and never did a set of professional pantomime actors look more at their ease than the gentlemen who laBt night made the walls of old Drury reverberate with laugh-ter._ They had constantly in their presence Miss Rosina Wright, one of the best danseuses on the London stage, and yet we never felt that Mr. J. Robins was one whit less a Clown than Miss Wright was a Columbine.
The alterations mad6 in the pantomime were very slight. In the bedroom scene the ghosts, instead of being sheeted spectres, became a mob of “ Corsican brothers,” and in the lines of the introduction spoken by Miss M. Oliver an allusion was made to the object of this particular performance—namely, the increase of the funds devoted to the i‘ Wellington College.”
Let us conclude by remarking, that among all the delighted spectators of the pantomime, none seemed more heartily amused than the occupants of the Royal box.

Thia theatre was reopened last night at farther reduced prices. The opera was La Sonnambula, with Madame and M, Gassier. The ballet divertissement of La Pera followed, in which Mademoiselle Palmyra, a danseuse from Marseilles, appeared with great success in a grand pas de deux and a 1 national Spanish dance. This lady is young, agile, and a thorough mistress of the mechanism other art, bat deficient in'giace and “eeolt'’—toase the conventional term. Mademoiselle Palmyra, however, completely won the favour of the audience, and was enoored in one of the variations of the pas de deux, in which she highly distinguished herself by her command of “ pointesand other manifestations of pedal dexterity. The house was crowded to suffocation, which muBt have been the more oousoling to the management if it bs true, as we heard, that there were no free admissions. “ Crcdat Judeeus.”

V} Drury Lane Theatre. / 7^r
The experiment of a “ cheap opera ” at this theatre seems to be attended with very fortunate results. The houses have been crowded —literally to overflowing; and that, too, not by the “ sons of free-i dom,” but by good honest people who pay their money, who enjoy I what they hear, and who applaud boisterously when the music I tickles their fancy. Mr. Smith has now a troupe of large dimensions I under his roof, and the weekly expense of maintaining it must be | considerable. To Madame Gassier, the prosperity of the under- ! taking has been mainly indebted, for this lady has proved herself to be a vocalist of no ordinary calibre, and one who would shine brilliantly even in the aristocratic hemisphere “ over the way.” jBut we have now another prima donna in the person of a Millie. Arga, whose name we never heard before, but who comes, it is said, from Paris. On Friday evening the Norma of Bellini was performed by way of debut for this lady, whose abilities were thus displayed under very prominent circumstances. We shall be better able to judge of the capability of Mdile. Arga when we hear her again. She laboured on the present occasion under very palpable nervousness, and she never fairly recovered herself throughout the evening. She seemed to understand the traditions of the part, and gave a very tolerable version of the Druid priestess, whose wrongs she illustrated with an energy which, by-and-by, will doubtless take a more decisive and forcible shape. She has a fine voice, although somewhat liable to get sharp when passionately exerted, and siugs in a style that implies good culture. The Oroveso of the cast was Mr. Hamilton Braham, and the Adalgisa, Mdlle. Magner, a lady who has been frequently met with in the concert room, and a singer of taste and acquirement, A Signor Armandi was the Pollio, the music of which he sang with taste and excellent judgment. Tlie opera passed off with great enthusiasm, and the two principal mor-ccaux were loudly encored.

The Pest of tib Ballet.—Ann Kirby, a decrepid old woman, in ragged attire, wlo might “ look” the part of Meg Merrilies after t her temporary deceise, was charged with various robberies behind j * the scenes of Drurylane Theatre. It appeared that for a long time * past there had been bitter complaints among the ladies of the corps ds ballet touching the mysterious disappearance of their private |
. and professional garments. Often had a “ Venus” or “ Mercury”.
| been shorn of her far proportions by the loss of a stiffener only five 1 ' minutes before beiig due ou the ramparts of the enchanted castle, j or on the front seatof a blue cloud capable of accommodating sir angels on the ro>f. Madame Louise, the reputed mistress i of the ballet, had made every effort to trace out the authorr of these frequent <ases of petty larceny in the dressing-rooms i of her little band but without the least avail. Lace sleeves, brilliant scarfs, and wen golden wreaths were not held sacred from the polluted touch d the pilferer. At length, on the afternoon in 1 question, suspicion f-ll on Mrs. Kirby, the charwoman of the estab-1 lishraent. She was seen leaving the attiring room of Miss Helqc 1 Jack with some nna<customed appendage hanging from beneath bar 1 gown. An alarm wis raised. Miss Eugenie Marshall, and a dozea of her fair coadjutor, were speedily on the spot. In vain did Mrs. Kirby protest that hr garter had simply come undone. By the J sanction of MadameLouise, she was fairly overhauled, and a num-1 her of articles—too delicate to mention, but all belonging to the ^ corps—were found oncealed beneath the prisoner’s petticoats. She * was, therefore, comuitted for trial. 9 i *,	/ oiry

Ju^ lx. VRVRT-LANE THEATRE, ¿Js% ~
The benefit md final appearance of Madame Gassier took v place last night,. In presenoe cf an audience that filled the iheafi-e to overlowing. The opera of the Barbitre di&iviglia and the last B.ene from La Sminambola were presented.
Our opinion of Madame Gaesier’s performances in Roaina . , and Amina has been stated more than onoe. Without recapitulation, therefore, we may state that she sang in her fp ■' most finished tnd bnlliant manner, and raised the house . Ml to the highest pitoh of enthusiasm. In the " valte” ■ , I of the lessor scene (which is by the late Strauss, and not, as tie bills have persisted in stating, by “ Ven-zana,” whose name was never previously heard in this - country), aod in the rondo finale, “ Ah non gionge,” Madame Gassier vas encored unanimously At the conclusion , of both opera) she was recalled before the footlights, rapturously applauded, and literally “ assaulted’* with bouquets. In the course of the evening a ceremony was ( gone' through upon the stage which, no doubt, had a 1 H meaning, but 1o the bnlk of the audience was about as intel- ' ligible as the ' music of the future” to the amateurs of “ the
Present,” “ Ur. Smith and a committee of gentlemen,” or reasons only kno.vn to themselves, presented Madame , Gassier with apiece of plate, stated to be " subscribed for her by her friuids and admirers, her brother artists, and the public.” That “friends, admirers, and brother artiste” should have cubbed together to present a testimonial to an amiable and accomplished lady is quite intelligible; but what “ the public” oan have to do with the matter is , not so easy to understand. Madame Gass* rr has not snng grade for pubic gratification, and consequently no obligation has been tontracted on either side. The delight created e by the talent <f the singer baa been paid for, in money and applause; and thus, to ail intents and purposes, Madame Gassier and thj English public are “ quits,”	.
Between the opens there was a vocal and instrumental concert, in wlich Madame Favanti, Mademoiselle Sedlat-zeb, Mademoiselle Eloise d’Herbel, and Herr Knhe—the former an infatt, the latter a fall-grown piaoist—and Meagre.
G. and V. Collins (violoncello and violin) took part; and after the Somambula a ballet. divtrtwiancat, in which Mademoiselle thereee, Miss Smith, and M. Friand appeared, brought the eitertainments to a close.	/ r /	. 1

i A semi-musical semi-dramatic performance took place Slast ¡light at this theatre, under the patronage of Her Ma-pestj the Queen, for the benefit of the French Charitable I Asacciation. The programme offered a great variety of at; tractions, commencing with Moliere’s comedy of Lt Depil Ammrtmx, and terminating with an act from Wallace’s opera of Murilana, the company of St. James’s Theatre assisting in the former, that of the Royal Opera, l)rnry-iane, in the latter. There was also a concert of vocal
and instrumental rnuais conducted by Mr. Tolly, in which // -several well-known English and foreign artists took part. '
The chief feature in the entertainment, however, was the , second act of Racine’s A thalie, comprising the virion and ' the ilalogne with the child, Joss. Mademoiselle Rachel, 'who had offered her services for the occasion, took the part -of Atbalie. This sublime performance was ail the more im-
pressive on account of the size of the theatre, which is i
i m
^evidently favourable to the French tragedian, -whoee voice 9

From

Sept. 1st, 1855.
“We have a large marrowbone to pick with the Directors of the Opera at Drury Lane. The other evening we attended the performance of DER FREISCHUTZ at that Theatre. The Overture, to he sure, was admirably played. Caspar did his spiriting not gently indeed, but, we will confess, extremely well, dramatically and musically. Agatha, or Agnes, sang characteristically in the character of an angelic kind of girl. We never saw or heard a better JRodolpho, alias Max; nor so good an
Anne, As to Zamiel, he played the deuce with a fine appreciation of the part.	,
/
Kuno,and the Hermit, all of them, behaved very well toWEBER; and Prince Ottoear acted with almost as much propriety as that which distinguishes Prince Albert. The Owl was effective in the Incantation scene, which the Audience wanted to	.
But to all of these personages the fashionably constituted mind will discern one insu* perable objection. Who was Caspar? Hr. Hamilton Braham. Rodolphol Mr. Arthur Lock sle y. Oltocar1. Mf-Glanville. Kunol Mr. Hodges. Killian1. Mr. CharlesWest. Zamieli Mr.CosTBLLO. Agnesi Miss(nofMdlle.)Lanza. Anne1. Miss Dyer. Th eHermWs name was omitted in the playbill—it was probablyJoHNSON. ((This brings us to our marrowbone. All these ladies and gentlemen were plain Misters and
Misses; there was not one Herr, Monsieur, Signor, Madame, or Mademoiselle, in the whole cast.
\
It is very true that the Chorus sang so well that it might have passed for German; and that the Conductor would have been taken to be a modern Roman, if, instead of preserving the final y of his name, he had denominated himself SIGNOR TuLLI. But the marrowbone remains:—The Artists above named were so many examples of talent considerable indeed, but merely native. We cannot say that the Owl and /Supernumerary Imps did not come from La Scala, or the Dresden or Berlin Opera—they hooted and danced well enough to warrant the pretence that they did, but it was not alleged. The Opera was performed, too, after the German manner; the whole of Weber’s Music retained, and the condensation done by cutting down Snooks’s dialogue.
“ Justice compels us to add, that the Drury Lane Operatic Company, conscious of the serious want of foreign names and a corresponding accent, appreciate their own abilities accordingly, so that
Their Prices for Admission are expressed by Low Figures, and anybody who simply wants to hear Good Music, can get that article very cheap at their Establishment.”

IVUlTirF*—Directors have been anxious, during their present short IttPiiLEi, season, to produce some of those .yric Plays, which, from their alliance with the beautiful Music of Sir Henry Bishop and others, have for years held rank amongst the most popular Lnglish productions, but they have
hitherto been prevented, for the want of such a rep» esentative of the leading Histrionic Part, as they felt necessary to do justice to thosePlays. They have great pleasure in announcing that they have prevailed upon the Eminent Tragedian, Mr.
JAMES R. ANDERSON
to appear for a few Nights, previous to his Departure for California, in the Characters of BOB HOY, and GAMBIA, in The SLAVIJ. It was also their intention to have produced shakspeare’s MACBETH, with the whole of LOCKE*» Music, and had made arrangements with Mr, Anderson to that effects—But objections having been made by the Lessee, that that Play did not properly belong to the repertoire of an Operatic Company, they will be unable to produce MACBETH as originally announced; and, under the circumstances, Mr, Anderson has most kindly consented to open in twOB BOY.

THE TROUBADOUR (IL TROVATORE)
^L,^Q2E3SER»S52S?SSSS --The Directoi's avail themselves of the completion of the first half of their short season, (which must positively terminate on the 29th of September) to return their grateful thanks for the liberal Public support awarded to their Experiment of GRAND ENGLISH OPERA AT POPULAR PRICES, the success of which has exceeded their most sanguine hopes. This success is the more flattering, as they have had to combat against the outdoor attraction of weather of unusual beauty, the absence of the Court, and of thousands of Excursionists from_
the Metropolis; and it convinces them that there may be found a sufficient number to support an Opera AT ANY
SEASON, if properly represented, and at proper Prices.	_
The Directors have been desirous to produce some of those LYRIC PLAYS, which, from their alliance with the beautifu, Music ot Sir HENRY BISHOP and others, have for years held rank amongst the most popular of English productions, but they have hitherto been prevented, for the want of such a representative of the leading Histrionic Part, as they felt necessary to do justice to those Plays. They have great pleasure in announcing that they have prevailed upon the celebrated Tragedian,
Mr. JAMES R. ANDERSON
(formerly Lessee of this Theatre) to appear for a Few Nights, previous to his Depaiture for California, in the Character« of ROB ROY, and GAMBIA, in The SLAVE—supported by Mrs. J, YU, WALLACK, Mr. STIAilT. and the Entire Strength of the Operatic Company. _
~The COMPANY of the “ltOYAL OPERA” now includes:—
LUCY E 8 € O T T
Miss DYER,	Miss FANNY REEVES and Miss LANZA.
Mr. ELLIOT GALER,
Mr. HERBERTE.	Mr. J. HALFORD,
Mr. GLANVILLl, Mr. WILLIAMS.
Mr. FARQ IT HAIiSON and Mr. II A MILT O N. BRAHAM.
Mr. JAMES H. ANDERSON
(Who can appear for a Few Nights only)
Mr. BARRETT	Mr. RAY,	Mr. STUART,
•	Miss FORREST, Miss WOODS.
AND
______Mrs. J. W. W A L LACK.
Up to this period the Directors have produced (irrespective of Musical Burlettas;—The Bohemian Girl, (Balfe)
Maritana, (Wallace) Der Freiscliutz, (Weber) Mountain Sylph, (Barnett) ROB ROY, (Bishop) Sonnambula, (Bellini) and Masaniello, (Auber) and The Slave, (Bishop). And they have in preparation,
Faust A Marguerite (Tuliyi Daughter of the Regiment, (Donizetti) Acis & Galatea, (Handel) FraDiavolO, (Auber) and The Troubadour, [II Trovatore] (Verdi) Thirteen Operas in Ten Weeks; a
sufficient evidence, they trust, that success has not made them idle, or unmiudful that the recognition by the Public of their services should stimulate them to fresh exertions. They regret that the arrangements of the Lessee for his Dramatic Season will prevent them from prolonging THEIR SEASON, which will Positively Terminate on Saturday. September 20th.___________________________________

A NICI	HI with the NATIVES
AT DRURY LANB,”
From w UMttttV’ September 1#/, 1855.
“ We have a large marrowbone to pick with the Directors of the Opera at Drury Lane. The other evening we attended the performance of DER FREISCHUTZ at that Theatre. The Overture, to be sure, was admirably played. Caspar did his spiriting not gently indeed, but, we will confess, extremely well, dramatically and musically. Agatha, or Agnes, sang characteristically in the character of an angelic kind of girl. We never saw or heard a better Rodolpho, alias Max ; nor so good an Anne. As to Zamiel, he played the deuce with a fine appreciation of the part. Killian, Kuno, and the Hermit, all of them behaved very well to Weber; and Prince Oltocar acted with almost as much propriety as that which distinguishes Prince Albert. The Owl was effective in the Incantation scene, which the audience wanted to encore. But to all of these personages the fashionably constituted mind will discern one insuperable objection. Who was Caspar ? Mr. Hamilton Braham. Rodolpho ? Mr. Arthur Locksley. Ottocur ? Mr. Glanville. Kuno ? Mr. Hodges. Killian 9 Mr. Charles West Zamiel ? Mr. Costello. Agnes ? Miss (not Mdlle.) Lanza. Anne ? Miss Dyer. The Hermit’s name was omitted in the playbill—it was probably Johnson.
“ This brings us to our marrowbone. All these ladies and gentlemen were plain Misters and Misses; there was not one Herr, Monsieur, Signor, Madame, or Mademoiselle, in the whole cast. It is very true that the chorus sang so well that it might have passed for German ; and that the Conductor might have been taken to be a modern Roman, ii, instead ot preserving the final y of his name, he had denominated himself Signor Tulli. But the marrowbone remains :—The Artists above named were so many examples of Talent considerable indeed, but merely native. We cannot say that the Owl and Super-numerary Imps did not come from La Scala, or the Dresden or Berlin Opera—they hooted and danced well enough to warrant the pretence that they did, but it was not alleged. The Opera was performed, too, after the German manner; the whole of Wkibr’s Music retained, and the condensation done by cutting down Snook’s dialogue.
“ Justice compels us to add, that the Drury Lane Operatic Company, conscious of the serious want of foreign names and a corresponding accent, appreciate their own abilities accordingly, so that their Prices for Admission are expressed by Low
Figures, and anybody who simply wants to hear good Music, can get that article very cheap at their Establishment.**_________________________________________________

“ We have a large marrowbone to pick with the Directors of the Opera at Drury Lane. The other evening we attended the performance of DER FREISCHUTZ at that Theatre. The Overture, to be sure, was admirably played. Caspar did his spiriting not gently indeed, but, we will confess, extremely well, dramatically and musically. Agatha, or Agnes, sang characteristically in the character of an angelic kind of girl. We never saw or heard a better Rodolpho, alias Max ; nor so good an Anne. As to Zamiel, he played the deuce with a fine appreciation of the part. Killian, Kuno, and the Hermit, all of them behaved very well to Weber ; and Prince Ottocar acted with almost as much propriety as that which distinguishes Prince Albert. The Owl was effective in the Incantation scene, which the audience wanted to encore. But to all of these personages the fashionably constituted mind will discern one insuperable objection. Who was Caspar ? Mr. Hamilton Braham. Rodolpho ? Mr. Arthur Locksley. Ottocar ? Mr. Glanville. Kuno ? Mr. Hodges. Killian ? Mr. Charles West Zamiel ? Mr. Costello. Agnes % Miss (not Mdlle.) Lanza. Anne ? Miss Dyer. The Hermit’s name was omitted in
the playbill—it was probably Johnson.
“ This brings us to our marrowbone. All these ladies and gentlemen were plain Misters and Misses; there was not one Herr, Monsieur, Signor, Madame, or Mademoiselle, in the whole cast. It is very true that the chorus sang so well that it might have passed for German ; and that the Conductor might have been taken to be a modern Roman, if, instead of preserving the final y of his name, he had denominated himself Signor Tulli. But the marrowbone remains :—The Artists above named were so many examples of Talent considerable indeed, but merely native. We cannot say that the Owl and Supernumerary Imps did not come from La Scala, or the Dresden or Berlin Opera—they hooted and danced well enough to warrant the pretence that they did, but it was not alleged. The Opera was performed, too, after the German manner; the whole of Weber’s Music retained, and the condensation done by cutting down Snook’s dialogue.
“ Justice compels us to add, that the Drury Lane Operatic Company, conscious of the serious want of foreign names and a corresponding accent, appreciate their own abilities accordingly, so that their Prices Jbr Admission are expressed by Low
Pigures, and anybody who simply wants to hear good Music, can get that article very Cheap at their Establishment.**	R. S. Francis. Fruiter. \ Catherip* Street, fc'trwta,

The Opeba at Dru;y-Lane Thbatee.—Ty Re Heney Jaeeett.—This insolveit, who had been musical director at
Drury-lane Theatre, applied to be discharged from Whitecross-Street Prison. Mr. Brickhill, a yrinter, appeared to oppose in persoil, and a gentleman on the part:>f Madame Martini; Mr. Sargood supported. The case was maitioned on a former occasion, when an application was made for jail, but not proceeded with. The insolvency in the present iustaice was to the insufficiency of the receipts at Drury-lane Theatre to neet the expenditure. The debts were £1,680, and last year whet the insolvent took the benefit of the act, they amounted to a considerable sum, Mr. Commissioner Phillips told the party who appears! for Madame Martini, whom it was stated could not attend, tint he could not be heard on her behalf. The complaint of Mr. Bridthill was, that a debt had been incurred with him under false repr&eutations. It appeared that Mr. Brick-hill printed for the French company at the theatre, and when Mr. Brickhill was absent throigh illness, in April last, the insolvent e tiled at his place »f busimss, and ordered some bills at the rate of A Os. per bundled. The wife of Mr. Brickhill was seen, and it was > alleged that the insolvent rad represented to her, that he had agreed with her husband at 6s. p r hundred. Work was done to £14 14s., and there had hecn paid £3., and £1 on account, leaving the present debt £11 4s. The msolveit denied that he made the representation alleged, and the ciediloraiked for an adjournment to produce his wife, who was at Ramsgate on account of ill health. Mr. Cornmis-sioner Phillips was mclintd to grant the application, but consulted the Chief Commissioner m the subject He read the opinion he had received, which he sad was not satisfactory, and he (Mr. Commissioner Phillips) propose! to consult Mr. Commissioner Murphy on the point, whether the case should be adjourned for the attendance of the wife of the creditor. At the same time, very little benefit to the creditor woild arise, as the debt was under £20, and tie detainer could be lodge!, even if a case was proved. Mr. Sargood com plained that there wasno pretence for saying this was any case ag»t Mr. Jarrett, who waaa gentleman well-known in his profession, and who had been connected with Drury-lane Theatre. His client was m prison, and was hoto be detained on such a com plaint ? Mr. Commissioner Phillips siggested that Mr. Commissioner Murphy should be consulted in tie morning. After some discussion, the case stood over until Tu-sday. As soon as the case was adjourned the parties consulted, andin a short time returned, and Mr. Sargood announced that the insolvmt could be discharged, as the creditor was “ satisfied.” Mr. Commitnoner Phillips thought it was the best end i of the case. Mi-. Sargood said it was certainly “ the best end,” as the insolvent would now le discharged. The insolvent was declared entitled to the benefit of tie act, and ordered to be discharged forthwith.	» t'cfti'f'
Is Re George Woabwsll. — This insolvent, the keeper of a menagerie, applied to be lisebarged. There was no opposition. It was elicited from the insovent that he had very large losses on the sale of his collection, lie had lost about £500, and under three executions very little wis realised on the sales by auction. The Court discharged the inolvent, subject to a notice on a creditor being set right. Seeing he smallness of the receipts, the learned Commissioner thought itwould have been better bad the insolvent ceased business at an easier period. In answer to a question, he said he was the nephew u Wombwell, the original exhibitor. rm ar &	• tt«	i
