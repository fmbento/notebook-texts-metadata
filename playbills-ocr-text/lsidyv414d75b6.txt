ventures to flatter herself that her Absence will be excused, and hopes to provo, by her slrunuous Exertions (when her

AFTER the repeated disappointments which have lately been attendant
on the Theatre, Mr. BART LEY is at a loss to find words to express his regret at being obliged to publish the following letter from Mrs. Jordan i
" SL Alban's, Five o'Clock, Tuesday.
*« DEAR SIR,
" Iwe?it this morning from my bed into my carriage, having been confined
to the former for some days, but my illness increased in so alarming a manner
before I reached this place, that I have been obliged to take to my bed here, and if
I am not with you by two o'clock on Thursday, you may conclude that I have been
under the necessity of returning home*
" I am too ill to feel much for my own disappointment; but I am truly griev*
ed at disappointing the public, if. it can be called a disappointment.
" Excuse this scrawl: if lean judge from what I suffer, it will be the last I
thall write for some time at least, perhaps ever.
Your's sincerely,

DORA JORDAN."
** To G. Bartley, Esq.
" Theatre Royal, Birmingham."
Mr. BARTLEY has only a few remarks to make upon this unfortunate
subject: he has waited until two o'clock, as the letter advises, though the
present bill was prepared in case of the worst much earlier, and at the abovementioned hour he now publishes it, with the positive declaration that Mrs.
JORDAN IS NOT ARRIVED.
The Theatre will notwithstanding be opened with the performances before
announced, and the part of the Widow Cheerly, which was to have introduced Mrs. JORDAN, will be sustained by

MRS.

DOBBS,

whom Mr. Bartley takes the liberty of recommending most particularly to
the attention of the audience, for the very great readiness with which she has
undertaken the arduous task of supplying Mrs. Jordan's place on this distressing occasion,

Change of Talent and new Pieces, worthy the Attention of the Patrons of theTheatre, will be presented to their
Notice.----~-.The Nights of Performance will (as at Bath, Bristol, Liverpool, and Edinburgh) depend on Circumstance*, which cannot be controuled, as it will frequently happen during the Season, in Consequence of the very
short Period that the London Theatres will be closed this Summer, that the Aid of eminent Performers cannot
be obtamed for more than three or five Nights, so that the Number of Performances in each Week must be uncertain, to give the Public the Advantage of witnessing an interesting Variety.
