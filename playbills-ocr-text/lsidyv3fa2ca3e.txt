Tub Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet again attracted a crowded audience at this Theatre last night, who testified their delight at the performance of Miss Fanny Kemble by loud and repeated plaudits. . On Monday evening her Royal Highness the' Duchess of Clarence came to town from Bushy for the express purpose of seeing Miss Kemble perform, and wa9 so much pleased that she desited Miss Kemble might be presented to her after the Tragedy. Accordingly between the play and entertainment Mr. Kemble had the honor of introducing his daughter to the Royal Duchess, who condescended to thank Miss Kemble for the p’casure she had received in witnessing her admirable performance. Pocnck's Drama of The Roller’s Wife was the Afterpiece, ia which Fawcett, Kee'ey, Blanchard, and Power exerted themselves most laudably. Blanchard's Lawyer deserves particular mention ; it is one of riiat dorer ooto.’a most perfect studies from nature- Red Rody loses all its terrific prominence in the drama, but Mr. Evans did nil that was required with the part as it stands One or two of the scenes are highly wrought, and are very effective in the acting. The drama altogether went off with great éclat. There was a row, in the first circle during the second act of the Tragedy, which was only pat a stop to by the whole audience standing up, and an unanimous call to “ turn them out.’’

Last night, the Comedy of She Sloops to Conquer was excellently performed at this house, and was warmly applauded in all its principal scenes. Miss Mordount was uncommonly clever as the heroine ; while Liston’s Tony, and Farren’s Hardcastle, were as perfect specimens of rich comic acting as we would ever wish to witness. After the Comedy, the Operetta, called “ A'o !” was acted for the second time at this Theatre, and was received in the most favorable manner. This Operetta was originally brought out at Edinburgh, and afterwards performed at the Surrey and Adelphi Theatres, though it !s merely a translation of a French Vaudeville. The plot is very simple, and tarns opon Sir George Doubtful laying a wager of £50 with his lady, that she, and the remainder of his household, would not be able to answer every question, within a given time, by the negative monosyllable of “ No !" The wager is accepted, and some ridiculous incidents happen in consequence. Miss Graddon and Mr. Sinclair were in excellent voice the latter introduced the pleasing air of ‘ The Bonny Breast Knots ’—There were two or three encores. Mr. \V. Bennett and Mrs. Orger, as Sir George and Lady Doubtful, acted

extremely veil ; and Mr. Browne’s Commodore Hurricane was highly humorous. The p:e<fe is tfery short, but if was so amusing, and so well acted, that we could hare wished it had been longer. The Farce of The Happiest Day of my Life concluded the evening's entertainment in a most agreeable manner ; Liston, Mrs. Glover, W. Bennett, and Miss Faucit, sustaining their respective characters with great ability
The new Comedy entitled Snakes in the Gras», to be brought out at this house on Tuesday, is cast with all the comic strength of the establishment : it is expected to prove a decided hit.
The directors of the Royal Academy of Music have decided upon giving a series of Italian Operas, at the new Concert Room, King’s Theatre, to commence at the latter end of next month. The sanction which had been given for the performances at Brighton by the pupils of the academy has been withdrawn.
It is said that Poole, in his farce of Simpson and Co. took the character of PeterSimpson from a respectable man of the name of Terry, (uncle of the late Mr. Terry the comedian) who carries on business in London ; and the portrait is said to be a faithful one. The nephew, it will be recollected, was the original representative of the character.
Messrs. Mathews and Yates have engaged the celebrated elephant which performed with such éclat at Franconi's Cirque Olympique in a melo drama called the King of Siam. The Stage door in Maiden-Lane has been widened in order to admit this great actor, who is now on his journey.
To the Editor cf The Theatrical Ohserter.
Dear Mr Editor, I address you from the Cigar Divan, King-street, Covent Garden, having just popt in to take a enp of Coffee, whiff a true Havannah, (till an hour over one or two of the Morning and Evening Papers—skim the
Magasines, and play a game of Chess—delightful place-Just wish to say a
word—beg pardon, hope 1 don’t intrude—but will you excuse me—I have to mention, that I've arranged So as to rub shoulders with my fiiends, and the fashionable world, at one or other of the Gran'/ Lounges abouttown.
On Monday, mu.st take another peep at the two new views, at the Diorama Regent’s Park—was puzzled to decide which was the most beautiful, St. Peter’s or the Village of Thiers—both exquisitely painted—the pictorial illusion complete—the water flowing, smoke ascending, sun shining—quite nature itself.— Had difficulty to persuade a fair lady next me, that we were really viewing merely pictures. Shall put off my journey to Italy, as I’m told, sub rasa, we shall have other views from that classic soil ; and if as good as St. Peter’s will satisfy me.	' J *	.	'
On Tuesday, I drop into the Exhibition of Sculpture, in Old Bond Street, to view the figures, life size, of Tam O’Shanter and Souter Johnny—work of a self-taught artist, James Thom—delighted beyoud measure—fully expected to hear Tam’s up oa ious laugh—the expression so perfect ; posse of figure« admirable. Whoever has read Burns, (and who has not?) must see them — This very ingenious Exhibition closes in the course of six weeks.
On Wednesday, I took a walk to inspect the magoificeut exhibition of Musical and Mechanical Automata—found them removed to the Argyll Rooms, Regent Street, where they now appear, in great splendour.
On Friday, I drop in to examine Miss Linwood’s curious Needle-Work, in Leicester Square; .
‘ Bring me, my love, a boltie of Godfree's all potent,’ thus I exclaim after my day’s perambulation—Itoa^t my King * God bless him’—Mrs.P. sips, smiles, and declares, the Wines from the London and Westminster Mart, inspire her— she delights me with Moore’s Planxty, * Fly not yet, ’tis just the hour,’ Ac.— but l intrude—beg pardon.

b<,'*;Lord Glengall has unquestionably written 'wtifi j Sheridan in his mind’s eye; and it is not, perhaps, ' saying morw . A is merited, when we add that the character of the dialogue bears more resemblance to ‘ of The School for Scandal than any other piece we at present remember; it is lively without affectation of spright- >. liness, and a good deal of judgmem has been shewn in adapting it to the particular personages; so that each may, in some sort, be said to have a style of his own. In want of truth, heart, and decency, all the characters meant for fashionable representatives are alike ; but in other respects they have strong shades of difference.
The only respectable persons in the Comedy are, the Old , Citizen and the Country Squire; and what amends Glengall may be able to make to his compatriots of the Green Isle for the insertion of Major O'Simper we know t v not: heis a sort of Sir Lucius O'Trigger, withoutaparticle . y-gi

of his sense of honour, and a most confirmed and wanton liar. Besides, Lord Glengal has put into the Major’s mouth sundry general and roost unjust imputations upon his countrymen, as, when in a dilemma, he calls upon “ the Goddess of Impudence, who never deserts an Irishman when he is bothered," to assist him. VVho ever, till now, h»* ,. ¡.hat the natives of the sister kingdom were at all remarkable for their effrontery ? But we have not space for particular criticism, and except;^ 0De point regarding “diners out by professi?),"'which is taken from a paper In the New Monthly, we cannot call to mind anything for which the Noble author is not indebted to his own resources. We may remark by the way, that we were hardly aware until this Comedy came out, of the extreme importance of newspaper criticisms ■ and paragraphs in the circles of fashion.
We may dismiss the performers in a few sentences, not because they do not deserve more, but rather because they deserve so much. Walx. ack was easy, but hardly • | sufficiently gentlemanly with his ease. Jones had but one . deficiency, and that was, that his manner was too slight ’. and whiffling to drawdown upon his part the full weight of ‘ contempt and scorn which ought to be feU for it. W. ) Barren left nothing uaattempted or unaccomplished to , make Counter an admirable contrast. W. Bennett was hardly good enough for his part, but this fault is of old standing with him : Cooper was discreet, but never ’ anything but Cooper. H. Wallace made a much better Irish Gentleman than we expected, though we could have endured (which is saying a great deal) a little broader bregue ; his gait has too much of the tragedy - strat for comedy. Miss Mordaunt was quietly pointed, rather wanting action than emphasis, and voice more than either:	she spoke a lively epi-
logue tamely. Mrs. Glover was just the rich merchant’s wife—not absolutely vulgar, yet anything but genteel. Miss Faucit must not fancy she is graceful, and a notion that she is not so would be of use to her. Mrs. Newcombe was sufficient for her character, and Mrs. ORGERmore than sufficient for hers. From the first there was an apparent indisposition in many ef the audience to be satisfied, but although some of the scenes were too long, the comedy so improved as it proceeded, that even they were compelled at last to applaud, and to make a bad parody of a good line.
“ Tbo** »ho cam» te hist remained to clap.”
The approbation was universal and zealous when ^Wallace gave out that the piece wou'd be repeated on Tuesday.	.	.

DRURY-LANE. > w " 'j The new Pantomime at this House,called Jack in the Box, Mid the Princess cf the Hidden Island, may be said to have been entirely successful; for although slight disapprobation was here and there expressed at the slow movement of some of the scenes, rather than of the scenery (which performed its duty very satisfactorily), yet, on the whole, the applause so greatlj- pr «dominated that the few hisses may almost go for nothing in the account. It concluded at so late an hour that «e shall forego any sagacious introductory remarks we intended to have made upon the Pantomime in general, and proceed to a brief narrative of the story (as far as any could be collected), and the succession of the scenery and incidents.
The first part, or introduction, relates to the story of Jack, who was confined in an adamant box by Peep-bo (Barnes), as guardian enchanter, for letting out the secret of the hidden island, where a Princess was confined, who was to be released by a Chinese Knight, attended by his ’Squire. The deliverance of the Princess by Heigh-ho i Howell) and his follower, Rum-go (J. S. Grimaldi), is represented first in “ a Vision of the Hidden Island,” and subsequently by the Knight and ’Squire in propria persona, the former cutting off the hand of the giant king, in whose possession she appears to have been held. The figures of his Highness and of her Biguess (the Queen), are extremely well managed, and excited bursts of laughter, especially when the former, getting a little too much wine into his head, became intoxicated and sleepy, and thus afforded the Knight an op portunity of accomplishing his enterprise. The giantess faints away during dinner, being represented rather in that condition in which women “ wish to be who love their lords.” We are thencecarried to the craterof a burning mountain, where the Box, with Jack in it, is deposited, and where we find the Enchantress watching over it: fal-ing asleep, she is surprised by the Knight, who seizes hextalisman, Strikes the box, and Jack leaps out. In reward for his liberation, he declares that the Knight and the/Jrin-cess (Miss Rvall) shall be married , but he does not seem to be able to effect their union until the parties have undergone a certain probation. He then converts the Knight and Princess into Harlequin and Columbine, and the Enchantress and the ’Squire into Pantaloon and Clown, at a slap; so that all the chief characters of a Pantomime are manufactured ' at once by a coup de maine. Le Chasse then commences, but not until the Clown, as usual, aiming a blow at Harlequin, has knocked down his master. These transformations take , place in a beautiful imaginative scene, called the City of Mists, in the Hidden Island, & from thence we are transferred at once to the lime-kilns nearGravesend. This scene may be , advantageously shortened, as nothing of interest occurs in it, and the kilns art in themselves no very pleasant or picturesque objects. The New Post-Office is next displayed,
with mails and omnibuses starting, and here the Ciown is extremely active in purloining coats, boxes, &c. with as much dexterity as any Cad” at the White Horse-cellar covdd display. An old gentleman loses his wig, and finds it in the hern of the Guard, which may t>e meant for a Cockney pun upon the air (hair) which ordinarily proceeded from that instrument. A stroke of Harlequin's sword converts the Post-office into a street with shops, in the windows of which “ the Annuals” cut a prominent figure, and the Clown, endeavouring to steal one or two, receives an unwelcome Forget me Not and a Keepsake from the owner of the house. Severely as some of these productions have been treated by the Reviews, we have nevei seen them so ill-used as last night, when they were hurled about the stage most unceremoniously. What is called Celuti in speculum, and which represents Harlequin and Columbine dancing before two supposed mirrors, with other figures dressed exactly to correspond, imitating their movements, was managed with the greatest skill and precision, and the dance was deservedly encored. A joke about a hundred pound note, taken from a letter addressed to Signor Paulo, (the Clown at the rival Theatre,) we did not understand; and we think the audience in general were quite as much in the dark. In future it may be omitted. The view of Mount Edgecumbe is a slight variation of Stanfield’s View of Portsmouth last year, and so good, that it will bear repetition. Here we are presented with a dance by the Siamese Youths, that is, two boys dressed to imitate them; and with a very capital and novel scene of its kind, in which all “ the scaly monsters of the deep,” or at least a good many of them are brought upoD the stage. The shell-fish were excellently dressed (as shell-fish ought to be), particularly a lobster, which sported its tail, ready boiled; to use Pendragon’s phrase, it performed parts with great e-claw. The music was adapted from Masaniello, and p. parody was sung upon “Behold, how brightly breaks the morning.” After some ridicule of the Fire Kmg, who is defeated signally by the Clown, who continues to swallow a glass of gin, instead of a couple of ounces of Prussic acid, we arrive at the most extraoidinary exhibition of the evening, in the person of Meinfierr Von Klushing the German Phenomenon, who performs the part of a huge monkey, in a most wonderful manner, shewing such a pliancy and convertibility of limb, that it might be almost supposed that he was made’ of Indian rubber,and had not a bone in his body. He shouldered his legs, just its one ofthe footguards shoulders his arms, and by most singular and hitherto-un-tried contortions of figure, astonished the weak minds of the beholders : some of them were really painful, and on this ground, if no other, offensive. Thu was the most extraordinary exhibition; the most beautiful was of a different kind—“ Stanfield’s Grand Local Diorama,” embracing views in succession, of Windsor, Eton, Virginia Water , and, finally, the artificial falls there, in real water. We cannot praise the skill displayed in these moving scenes adequately; earth, water, and air, axe depicted with equal truth and beauty, and the artist has taken a succession of most beautiful objects on which to exercise his almost matchless pencil. The cascade, surprisingly contrived, is seen through the temple of “ the Fairy Luminaria, and it forms the grand finale of the Pantomime. Thirty-nine tons of water (as we are informed by the pixy-bill) are discharged from the highest point to which they can be raised in the Theatre, and it is made to fall from crag to crag, and scatter its foam and spray on all sides. This was, of course, the most splashing scene of the whole performance, and it was well chosen as a conclusion. Grimaldi (who, some how or other, has left Covent-Garden) gave out the Pantomime for repetition, without any opposition, amid the most general applause.
