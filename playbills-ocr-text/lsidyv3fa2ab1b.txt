Theatrical Fund.
Several Lovers of the Drama.having made Enquiry into the State of the Theatrical Fund, at Covent Garden.; for their Gratification, and that of the Public at Large, a ihort and accurate Account
thereof is here fubjoined:
fjpHE Inftitution was eftabliihed in 1765, under the Aufpices of the late Mr. Beard and Mrs Rich ; and received the San&ion of Parliament in 1776. There are now, and have been for more than Twenty Years, feveral Annuitants fupported by it,chiefly Families andWiDows. Yet, notwithftanding it has been fo long fet on foot, the Intereft ariflng from the Funded Capital has never been equal to defraying One-HalV of the Annual Diiburfe-ments. The deficiencies have been continually fupplied by prvgrcffive Weekly Contributions from the Performers.
When this is confidered, it is refpc&fully prefumed, the
A
geueiofit) of a Britiih Public will be exerted this Night, in favor of io. liberal and beneficial an Inftitution.
