Capt. KETTLE begs leave to state the imperious necessity that has compelled
him to have recourse to a measure so repugnant to his feelings. In consequence of the Bankruptcy of the late Distributor of Stamps for this County,
he has been deprived of an Annuity payable from that Office, of 100l. per
Annum, exclusive of a considerable sum which would be now due. The
consequence of this serious loss has so much embarrassed him, that he is now
under Arrest and in Confinement. As his present embarrassment has not
arisen from any Imprudence of his own, he throws himself upon the generosity and well-known humanity and benevolence of his fellow townsmen.'

This is the very Falstajf Shahespear drew."
But all good honest Flesh and Blood and Bone,
For you, with Diffidence he bids me say,
And weighing, more or less, some thirty Stone;
Upon tlve Northern Coast by Chance we caught him, Should you approve, you may command his Stuy,
And hither in a broad-wheeledPVaggon brought him, To lie and swagger here another Day.
If not, to better Men he'll leave his Sack,
For in a Chaise the Farlet ne'er could enter,
And go as Ballast in a Collier back.
And no Mail Coach on such a Fare would venture.

FIRST NIGHT OF

S. KEMBLEs
ENGAGEMENT.

Sir JOHN FALSTAFF,
Which Character he has performed with diftinguiflied Applaufe at both Theatres in London and in
mod of the Provincial Cities and Towns of Confequence in the United Kingdom.
A Falstaffhere to Night, by Nature made,
Lends to your favourite Bard his ponderous Aid;
No Man in Buckram he—no Muffing Geer,
No Featber-bed, nor e'en a Pillow-bier,
But all good honest Flesh and Blood and Bone,
And weighhig, more or less, some thirty Stone;
Upon the Northern Coast by Chance we caught him,
Andhilher in a broad-wlieeledfVaggonbrought him,
For in a Chaise the Varlet ne'er could enter,
And no Mail Coach on such a Fare would venture.
Blest -with Unwieldiness, at least his Size

Must Favour find in every Critic's Eyes;
And should his Humour, and his mimic Art,
Bear due Proportion to his outward Part,
As once 'twas said of Macklin in the Jew,
" This is the very FalslajfShakespear drew."
For you, with Diffidence he bids me say,
~\
Should you approve, you may command his Stay, C
To lie and swagger here another Day.
j
If not, to better Men he'll leave his Sack,
And go as Ballast in a Collier back.

L-l _.

A Falstaff here to Night, by Nature made.
Must Favour find in every Critic's Eyes ;
Lends to your favourite Bard his pond'rous Aid;
And should his Humour, and his mimic Art,
No Man in Buckram he—no stuffing Gecr,
Bear due proportion to his outward Part,
No Feather-bed, nor e'en a Pjllow-bicr,
As once 'twas said of Macklin in the Jew,
But all good honest Flesh and Blood and Bone,
" This is the very Falstuff Shakespear drew."
And weighing, more or less, some thirty Stone ;
For yon, with Diffidence he bids me say,
•,
Upon the Northern Coast by Chance we caught him.
Should you approve, you may command his Stay, v
And hither in a broad-wheeled Waggon brought him.
To lie and swagger here another Day.
)
For in a Chaise the Varlet ne'er could enter.
If not, to better Men he'll leave bis Sack,
And no Mail Coach on such a Fare would venture.
And go as Ballast in a Collier back.
Blest with Unvvieldiness, at least his Size

This present WEDNESDAY, November 1, 1809,
Will be prefented the celebrated Tragedy*of

The Grecian Daughter.
The Intereft of this Tragedy is greatly heightened by its being drawn from an hiftorical Fail, and though many Centuries hive
elapfed fince the Occurrences tranfpired, yet we have a ftrihing Similitude in theprefent Times of an aged virtuous Monarch drugling to exterminate Ufurpation and Tyranny. It alfo inculcates an excellent Moraf—for what can be more edifying to Youth, or
grateful to mMuVe Judgment, than the fliining Example of Euphrafia, in whofe Character is united all the Domeftic Virtues of tl«
duteous Daughter, affectionate Wife, and tender Mother; the Extremities to which flie is driven forthePrefervation of her venerable
Father, excites the moft lively Sorrow in the Audience, and the Cataftrophe of the Play it well calculated to foothe tbofe Feelings, by
a glorious Proof that pel fevering Virtue is in the End triumphant.
