The Public!, is, with the greatest deference, itiform'd, that, the ANNUAL LICENSE
.* THIS THEATRE is extended to FivE MONTHS ; belag one Month longer thin the
• nal grant. In consequence, therefore, of this protraction, end, in consideration of the
ST-ttnini season of the year, the Proprietors have agreed to venture on receiving
SECOND* PRICE ;—which their heavy expenses do not permit during the preceding
nths when their competition with various other places of Summer Amusement (whose
"(tractions are, then, at the height) proves a most material drawback upon their profits ;-—
T d when the length of the day*, and the general heat arid fineness of the weather, induce
thousands of this Metropolis to leave the Town entirely, or to prefer numberless modes and
rd-ices of Entertainment, to the exhibitions of a London Theatre.
To establish the receipt of SECOND PRICE without a certfm.ty of logs, those prices
re now adopted which were taken on former, and similar occasions .-—namely,-when t h .
House was hired by the Drury Lane and Covent Garden Managers, and when the chief
Proprietor here carried on the performances, on his own account, for the greatest part of
the Winter, during the rebuilding of the late Drurv Lane 1 heatre..—The only departure
from those precedents will be that the SECOND PRICE to the Pit will be Sixpence less.
The following Prices, to be received from the 16th of September, to the 1.5th
nf October inclusive (when the Theatre will close) are most respectfully announced.
