MR CALCRAFT
Begs respectfully to apprise the Public that he feels most deeply tlio disappointment to which they were exposed last night, and assures thorn that he was not made acquainted with Mr. Khan's inability to perform until ten minutes before the time of opening the Doors. Mr. CALC RAPT went to Mr. K ban's Hotel immediately and saw that he was suffering under a sudden and most severe attack of illness which rendered him totally incapable of rising from his bed. At the late hour it was impossible to acquaint the Public, or to make any substitution of performances and nothing remained but to close the Theatre. Mr. CALC RAPT pledges himself that the above statement is strictly correct, and at the same time does not impute the smallest blame to Mr Kuan. who he f««U convinced only delayed the communication of his illne»» from a hope that he might be enabled to appear, and an anxiety to fulfil Ids dutie- to the Public and the Theatre.
