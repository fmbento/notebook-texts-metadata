..?■£*	— Dhuky-LXi^,
A Dramatic R^tonce,called Bln^Brurd, iranjjatcd from the FrencfTby*Mr. Colma,n, was performed latt night,.for the firtl time. It h taken from the old (lory, and? “as a dramatic fwoduftion, poffeffes a fuffi-cient (hare of mterefl to render it attractive; but its chief pretenfions ip public favour rclf neither on the ftory, which is too romantic to be con fide red at all probable, nor upon the dialogue, which is weak and incoherent. Its merit conltlls In the beauty of the mufic, the fplcndqur of the feeuery, and the ingenuity of the machinery. Thefe, indeed, form a powerful aid to the piece, and will not f|il tp bear it through in popular tijumph.—The fpeflaclt is of the moll magnificent deferiptiqn. The procefiion of Ntie Beard to thp hqufe of lirafmnti to bfing Jwme his intended brtde, Fatima, exceeds any thing <>f tlje kind we Hhve for a long time witneljed ; and the fcenic decorations are bevond any thjag the EnglifU $age lraa lately exhibited. Of the mafic too much cannot be faid : it is at once gr«^nd, fimplc, and fcientific, and adds *a frefli laurel to the mufical fame of Kelly.—An e'ephant, two camels, and fever a I hoifcs, a If aijihrtal, are tntmdbrcr cd in the pageantry, and produce the aol) pleating eftefr. In the courfe of the reprefentatior* many blunders in working the feenory, which are u#avoidab e in a ftrft repsefentation of «his- nature, occurred, and th® delays v/huh took place were confequenily.very great. I'he gratification which the audiyce expertraced from the exhiaiiion, however, amply cbmpenfated for the inconvenience attendant upon thofe protractions, arid the whole went off with great ectai. It was 12 o’clock before the certain dropped, owing to the frequent interruptions caufed by the ttujjnitudeofthe fceucry, and the difficulty of erecting fotne jwrts of it: hut thefe obflacle^ will of codrfe be obviated by repetition, ?nd we have no doubt but that Blue Beard wil) long cotuiuut to ‘attrail crowded Houfcs. The expfence of getting it up ts faid fo be not lefs than two thoufand p6undi. Moll of the for.g'. were delervcdly encored, and fotne of the fentimeuts were highly applauded : the rerioui p .rt of the dialogue is by far the bell : the wit Is, for the moil part, very mediocre. A political tllufion, “ that it was t fine thing to be a great man in office, when no one could turn him out," was well received, although a long contention, in which the ayes had decidedly tne advantage, arofe in confe<jueiice of it.—;-Palmer, Kelcy, Mrs. Ci&uch, and Mif» Decamp, exerted their abilities throughout with the l^ppiell efted, Mrs, CaOucn looked divindl/, and Her dreis, wliich was becoming and decent, formed a ftrtlung contrail to the indelicacy to which Mifs' D e-caIap hid recoilrfe, tp dtfplay the fymirietry of her net {on.	*
m,	.*	Drüiy-ianjî.
The fplpndid fp?3*cje of Blue Beard was lafi nighu repeated to a crowded and brili^aut audience, and with fuch alterations a< cannot fail of rendering Tt a H-vourite with the Public. The dialogue, which» ia entertainmîutî like this, foould not weary the attention, or retard too much the progrefs of the aflion, ha* been very properly abridged, and fome political »liufions, which on the firft reprefenuùon, although,, they excited cotiftdenble applaufe on the one hand,-cnjfed much difapprobation on the other, ate judici-oufiy omirtwi, / ¿ fie exhibition of iho blue cAamber ¡a the firll aft, ts now difpenfed with ; the bufinefs is merely deicribed, and thus the effeft of it? in »he fécond *ta n wonderfully increafed, by th; audience not being ranriliarired »0 this feene of horror. The grand and compficateu foensry wa$ managed with improved (kill and increaicd facility % and among the minor alterations, the drefs of \Mifs Dkcam?, which <jn ttie firfl night was bjr/jr too Jhtvy, not to fay indelicate, was rendered m^pPfcon-fiûent with the commendable principle oftà&nM» decency. ITe performance of thw Lady, oo‘ the* top oi the Tower, in the fall feene, w«ia« very
freat ; and Mrs. CseocM'i delrneatton of the iflrclfes of Fatima was truly excellent. Ktl x.y, to whom sve are indebted for the roufic of the PTec’, acquitted hunfelf with his ufoal ability a* a Performer ; Pài-.u^k, Bannister, and Str&r r, Jëüi nothing undone th» could be accompHfhed in theif refpeëivt fitu-ttiuns i and Pasisot ai: ipUy«* hcr çr#e%l »S. tuuiles to llic admiration of ¿very fpeftator* •

J,	.}iP D«uat.L*!iirt
A ChmeJv, called Knave or Nrt, wa per4 formed laJl ni.-ftn. for »he firft time. The reception ii experienced was Uj very Unfavourable, rimr the ¿Mana geis, in all probability, will not judge it their interefl to attempt to repeat it. Governed by this opinion, oiJr<>b-fervaiions will neceffarily be general and brief. Indeed, were it pofftbfe for us to think otbenviie, we ihould not c mfider the piece as entitled to particular attention. i'he Inbjtfft is of a nature the* moll incoherent and objeftmn »••le. Whatever meaning it has, goes to a very immoral a- i dangerous, e'.id. All legal uiages and focial cufloms a s dclined ail!! held in contempt: laws ate reprefented a formed for the purpofe of protecting the gtii/fy and pumfhin* the innocent; every man is branded as a knave in principle, and a villain at heart *, individual who are rich are indiferiminately difhotiell \ and titles are obt lined for the purpofe of fcrcening the darkeft crimes. When the eilablrfhinem of fin.h pernicious principles as thrfc is the aim of an author, his total failure cannot afford much matter of regret to the moraltO, or to the advot.au; of focial order. As a literary compoli-tion, it deferves bu hide better, mention. The dialogue is exceedingly crude and dull, and where any thing like fenpmrnt occurs, ft is fo far ovcrflraihed a» to become wholly unnatural. The aitempis at fpiighdinefs, or vvii, are low and contemptible and the ferious parts are, on the whple, u n- i-f. With te/peft to the general con-ftrmliou of the piece, wc fhall only ehfeive, that we have feldom known a more puny performer,.e, and that the incidents are wholly irrecortcilcablc to b-afon. 1 he Peifoitftctsdid every thing in their power to plead the caule of the “ Knate,1*but the audience, b rrowing the a fer part » F j)r title from tbe aiuhor, very generally prnncmftred the difnpproving moncdvl igMc “ Kni.” The junior Ban n isrER, in the cua-Ira ter of a fpoiled boy, tnade the troll of his office *, but what „Ie talent? If there is not art opportunity afforded to difplay them ? Suth wa* (he cafe oCthis admired Aftur, who had eu railed to his csrc a irida burjtling, who had fcareely a natural good cjutlity to recommend bi n to the patronage of die lVtbltc. pAtMCR was m able reprefema'ms of a Knave, who wfts fullered to hold up to contempt and ridicule fopic of the midi amiable train of ctv.li»d mm; and WkouciI ft>N, Barrymorc, Sttfcrr, and \VTwit*e* gave the ut.ru >11 of their aid to the piece. Mr*, Jordan, Mils	and Mifs Ob
Cam?, alfo afforded their ftrengih ; but the Knave ■was >ot to be borne, and he may be faid to have literally fallen to the ground, The Epilogue is a very poor poetic; The put port of it U a compliment Co the versatile talents of Mrs. Jordan; and, ft range to relate, a ridicule of the moll popular pieces (the VaJUt Spt.6lre end Blue Beard) that, have for fume time been proJuced at this Theatre. The Houfe was very Full.
Wc find, fince writing the'abavfe, that the fecond re-prcientatioii of the piece is announced in the bills for this evening. \Ve muft therefore conclude, that conSdcr-ab!e alterations are ¡mended to be made $ in which cafe wo (hall Dot fail to make an impartial report of tbajr fetcrifs.
ó ‘	DRCAY-LA^t.’'
#fhe new Comedy of Knave or AW, was repeated Uft nighuto a very orderly audience, there herog « general Convlntion of thè Author's friends. Several judicious alterations and neceffary omi(lions having taken place in the dialogue, the whole prfcfented itfelf in ft lefs objeftionablc fhape. but the cloven foot has not yet been amputated, and ihe’/C*t<n* continues to ftrnt about in monllrous pace, marked with nvny of bis original unnatural deformities : forno of his mod for. bidding features have affumed a anco nuli! and conciliating appearance ; but the ou/k which has boon thrown ©verni» hateful naturo«oly ferve* to cover the cxlcint blemiChci of his character» not to hide the hideous 'oloui 4, of his heart.—Tho Peffo*trtm were ill in high {piriti* and the ardour with whu h they exerted their redactin’C (giems was much appUi Ud by (Tie audience. «
Previn*» to the conmeocetnent of the.picce, Mr. Whwuouitom came forward and read a few lines which he had received from the Author, in which he diklaioaed any particular alluOoj», and begged tho indù Igeoca of the audience to tiear the Play with calarne ft before they delivered their decifion upon its merits* i his’feu sefl wi* well receded, and lincili* complied wi ll. The whole was diipaflionittely heard, and, o« the third reprcfonration being atmouuced, a duufuift took place, Htica (lie dyes appeared to have »decided uuyo<uy,—The Epilogue, as well as the dialogic o£ the Piece, has undergone tome alteration.
Bair Botri followed, and concluded, lise evening's entertainment wuh jpkndui lue cefi.

The feene is laid in Germany. Of the plot, the following is an cut line :
Count IVuibuurg, from vexations in his ftmtty, and dif-guded wjthjthe world, become»a MifanthropiR. and, ddi-rotrs oi beiug fcqueftcred from the world, retires to a cottage, whiejt he obtatos pofleflion of, tn the abfence of Count fCinter/tn, frpm his Reward.—The Countrfs fruit/wi havin'* been feduced. and cloned from ber hulbiudiin the hour, contrition had bef; veiled the protection of L^Jytt'ist ' and had obtained it, in the character of an upper I keeper, w1k> was intrnftcd with-the imtm houfehoM, during the (hortaWence of the interval the Strom*** atn imituaUv occitffced, r\ ipot, m act» of fccrct bonevt»»cnc-.\ avo.o:rg o\t< c ntribufing much to tiic relief of a dilteifod p< affords them great fcope for humane flections.— Sattnton, the Reward^ his Ton Pdf th? fcmnt oi the Strang.r, are characiei ui their fcver.il Rations until the main	,u
commences, by thoreturn from their excurflon of family, who confift ot the Count /Tinterfun and Ms l.ady\ with their brother, the Baron Steinfort.*-At tiiH light the Baron iscapiivaied with the »¡fumed hpuiekcvpcr, reveals hts paflton to her, who receives it with £urpide,»nd.a delicate obiettion, becoming her fcitllble and u ticking fnm l During tin» ullociation the Count is employed in attending to furvey the improvements uudein ml grounds during his aUfentc, and accidentally, by the breaking of a Clmreic bridge, is.Touted oyer bead and e >rs in a filh-pond, from which he is extricated adventurouUy by the Strang* r, who happens tn bo near the foot. This creates a curtolity to become acquainted with Ids lingular charaAer, who, on all occanoni', aff&Cts to be a determined hater of the human race. Chance, however, throws him in the way of n« Stetn/ort, wlto, even in the 11 range difguife of an emaciated hermit, difeovers him to be his intimate friend Charles, the Count IVaibourg, and learns the melancholy cattle or bin fcuueilcred Hate, which is principally amounted for by tit?
I eduction and elopement of his wttu, oy whom he had two children, who arc at nurfe in tiic lame neighbourhood.“-The imercefhtm of Lady Hlnttrfou with Mrs. Hal'tr, 1« behalf of her brother, bringson an explanation of her real condition. By degtv« the two nliumctl changers are uu* cimfcioufly brought into the prefeneeof each othet; adif-covety takes place, and, by the generous inteMrcnuoo of the Baron, who is at the fame time the friend of the hulbuui, and tiic lover of the wife, mutual confcflfoitt, co^eetflnns,' and forgivenef* take place, which affords a njoil Itttetelting and ttilciftiiig tale of connubial woo.	“ ‘
Bj VIC uimcruauu mm riecc to o<s>f irannauon iroOT the German, and indeed it pofleffes throughout too much of me German flyle of dramatic writings. The liory is lïighJy imerefting, and the ferious parts of the dialogue^ vfrith the exception of a few*iuflances of erro-nibiis metaphor, are very pathetic, frequently making -the moltfforcible appeals to the feelings, afid as often c;41mg form the'tear of fymratllf. Its interefl, however, experiences a dreadful drawback from the ¡n&fferablc redioufnefs that charaflerifT. aimed every fcenc. The palBons are, for a time, verj fuc-cefeludy worked upon, buL the fubjefts arc - invariably fpun out to fueft an mjudicious and extfava gant extent, that the deep effect prodiAed ip the be-ginn'mg feldom fa-la to be loll in the diUended dulneT of the tale. The dialogue muft therefixe be eon fide rably abridged, as well for the purpofe of pre fervittg jhe ir.tercft of the piece, as foa ihortcrung the tune of reprefeutuiou, which is at leall an hoar too loftg. tt being^alf paft ten before the curiain dtUpt. The coml^iarts of the dialogue pof-.r,s_r; ;^lthe ti ¡.»htefl claim t^ approbation: th«f are grotcrq.ie an^	witliout a fmgte trait of nie^nLry
in their compofition ; and if i!wi efttira omillion of mi charatier of Solomon (an unmeaning pretender to con-fequence) h included in the curtailments, the Stranger will be ridded of a very irkfame incumbrance — .With fU the imperfetHons of a firft p^jfjrmancc, the Play was weu received. The intereft, although artfing more from die pilîton* than from lire judgment, improves progreifively ; rhe connexion is drfeovered in the thtrd atf, but the denouement is not evident until the conclufion.- On the whole, it is a very imprdJive produftioti, and, if jndiciouily curtailed, will not failtp enfurethe Stranger many a hearty welcome.
There is very little originality of character in the Piece. We h^ve air aly feen Kk.mule as a mifan. thrope, and Mrs. Siodons as a feduced repentant w'tlV. 'Mie atfing oi the formsT was truly gieat -, and that of the latter would have been more hippy had her delivery been .'eft fumai. All the other performers acquired thentiilves with much credit. Mts. üî-and and Mils l.EAXare introduced to ling a duct, befide which the former has a very pretty ait allotted to her, which was nniver(ally encored.	-	• fAt.	• .
The Play was announced for repetiticn with very general upplaule.	'	.
The Prologue, which was fooken by Barhymorf, contains nothing ffukicg. i ne Epilogue is fomewhat wbindiefl, and Was delivered by Suktt, in the chs-riSer of a Norwood Gipfey.

REPORT.

COURT OF KING'S BENCH, Wait t*
J	GlANii |b»f. *	‘	’
j tlVM^HRKVS v. tOHO CAj*JM<*0*p.
According*« Mr. Gibbs’s apenfr>g<*this wa&an a#ion for ¡a very violent aflault and battefy, brought by Mr. Humphreys agaiaft the Right Honourable Lord Caroelford. Mr. Hotftpbreys wsj* tile fou of a very rf^peftable Clergyman in the coimtry, had been brought up to tratW, and wA> now fa Chemift in Fleet ftrect. The Learned Counfel faid, he was extremely lorry to think that a Nobleman of Lord Camelford's high rank auci ffotfon fliould have been guilty of fucii an ¿(fault. But it lhotfld.be-rpmembered, that, bou eVor efe-. ' a id-pis 1}ariosi might be, no man in Lowland was above the law,. (,
> ‘This wanton, unprovoked, ami violent took place at the Theatre, the circtfu?fta«oc&*dii which we Until ftate frqnrthe evideoce of foe x,|t-ndffirs.	* .• .
■Mr. Bennet faid, he was-a Boxykttperqjt'&ni** •ry-lane Theatre, and was attending his duty therw on the ad of April laiL- Two Gentlemen were locking in at the box-door,/through thefwindow^ when he-ihdarj (^e of tH^fe &^u(Iet^e|i fa>\! “ I have as good a right-to look through as you*”«— Immediately upon that, the witneis few Lrttdl&aP melford, the tithq^of i,h? \wq, knock Jtht qtfepr down. He could not tefl which pf-the two hfrU the wonts, “•Ihaveaa-good aright to look through as you.” Mr. Humphrey^ fell head ov§r jkeeia< down fon*e flops., He gpt up again, and afked Lord Camelford what he meant bv fhar? He did not hear more words pais, but Lqrd Camelfacd knocked Mr. Humphreys dpwn a fecond naif. He fell down the four fteps again. Mr. Humphreys got tip, and aiked his Lord (hip what he meant by fuel* conduit? He alio aiked a Gentleman who was ttaudiug by for a pencil, to give Lord Camtlford bis addrefs, and he aiked his Lordftiip to give him his; to which lie made no aniwer. Mr. Humphreys then called his Loro (I dp a icoundrei. Lord C. then turned round, and gave him four Mows on the face, and about the eyes, and cut Ids face open near the eyes. Tlie blood ran down face, handkerchief and waift-coat. His Lord (Up thea went away to another part of the houfe.	•	.
On croft-exarj.in&tlon the witnefs fepj, that halfprice bad been proclaimed jdit nbouc-that tim . Some people «KutfHy cAme up at riiat lithe to loci: through the doer, V>j.\t that w^(;u6tk!ie Cafe that night, Thefe two Gcmtiemcl^vveiu the only perrons then prefent, and two <5emlem^nmi^tfook tliriiugh very eafiiy at the i&ne tiro«. U'hW Mr. Humphreys got up after his tall, heenme elide up to .Lord Cam cl ford, ami aiked him what be meant by that? His Lordibip might have given fofog anfwer to that, though the v/itud* did not h ar it. ¿After Mr. Humphreys had been twice knocked dotfhbj’ lArrf U^nielforU, he laid, “ You behave like; a/cttUijdr^l.” .	.
' Two other witiiefTes were ¿ailed on the paft of the P&nitiff, who fatly confirmed the evidence of the laft ivitneG». Catiierme Bowman, .-n* of thefe witnell'e«, laid, when the few Mr Humphreys fell down the Tops head over heels, flu thought his ne^k mult be broken. It appeared from the evidence of Mr. Cooper, another witnefe, that thefe
blows were (truck by Lord Camelford with great violence.
Mr. Burrows, a furgeon, faid, he attended MK Humphreys in confluence of this aifttrit. His face was very much (welled, cut, and disfigured, and he appeared to be very bad.
Mr. Lrfkinc, on the part of Lord Camelford, called no with HT«, but made a very eloquent ipcech in mitigation of damages. He lamented, that from the nature of the cale, the Jury could not be informed how this difpute commenced.— Tlie firil words which were fworn to were tbofe of Mr. Humphreys, Who faief, M I have as g «od a right to look through » you*’—now ibis very ex-preffion proved that fonie altercation had raken place between thcjji before It was a rnnft improbable circumflance indeed, that Lord C. if he had received no provocation whatever, fhould haveftruck Mr. Humphreys; but the expreffion he had juft alluded to proved that fon# difpute had taken place between them. The Jury, would obferve, that half-price had begun at that time, and the perlons who cam? in were of courte anxious to get {daces, and were looking into the boxes for that pnrpofe ; and Lord C. and Mr. H. having met at one of the doors, that kind of Play houfe (cuffie which conftituted the firft afliult, might eafily hâve taketi place. What was Mr, H/s conduct after he was puflied down flairs?.—Why he applied to the Noble Lord an epitiiet which no man pf Lirit could biar. If it was true, as Mr. Qjjrhi Wad fîaied; that Lord C. iva*^,e aggreflor in the ®ft inftance, and that Mr. H. was mcjfowd to fetk redrefs from a Court of Law-hcftiould ÿCyë kept himlelf in the right, throughout the •ftion4 inflaad o! which he ui«d exprcffioO6 which no Gentleman could put up with, ,and wbion n»v turaliv produced the tecond afiault. Even if Mf. H. ‘had bee«* inclined to have appealed for fatil-(wSUou to what ware called tut Lawk of Honour,, but-which ought urtt to be named in a Court of Juftice, even in that cafe, he ought not to have made ufe of an expreffion, which under AferfUfg cumftances one Gentleman ought to ufe to *00-, ther. Upon the whole the Jury, he hoped, would be of opinion 4hat thi» was a playhoufe (cuffie, and that very moderate damage* would be fufficient.	’ ‘	.
Lord Kenyan oblerved* that the anxiety and eloquence difplaved by tMtaknted Couulel, in making an apology for the 0efendant, only tended the more to iatfcty hfc mind how imp-rfeH that apology was. Thete was one observation made by him, which he coukl not pafs over unnoticed. He had told the Jury there were ta o ways of redreffing an.Thjury ; one as » Gentleman, by an appeal to the Laws of Honour ; and the other, by an appeal td the Laws of the Country. It wits thefefote for thé Jüry to decide, whether ,'tbt Piaiiititf had made a proper choice ; and •he (incerely hoped the Jury would, by their ref-dift, convince the world,that when perfons were infulted, and ma*le their appeal to a Court of Jtiftfce, and the Laws of their Country, fuel* appeal (hoold not be made ineffectually. ■
The Jury retired a very fliort time, and re* turned with a verdi# for the Plaintiff—Damages FIVE HUNDRED BOUNDS.
Mr* Gibbsrequefted his Lordfhip to ceî|ify.-
Lord Kenyon faid, he certainly would. He highly approved of the verdi#. Young men of high rank and naftv tempers, he Cud, ought to have fuch a kflbn read to them...	■	•’J. j
