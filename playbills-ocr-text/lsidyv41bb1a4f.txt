Mr. SMEDLEY
Having become the Proprietor and Lessee of the Theatres Wakefield, Bradford, and other places in the County of York, and finding that the necessary attention in Towns so large, and a company so numerous, to be more than he couid himself do justice to, he is induced to retain his eldest Son’s assistance, at least until his second Son is old enough to be of the same service. He therefore, in the mean time, has committed the management of those Theatres which have been in his possession so many years to Messrs. ROGERS and MOSLEY, whom he has selected for their talent, activity, probity, and good conduct, and if the public have hitherto thought kindly of Mr. S. of which, he is assured by the support he has met with, he can with confidence recommend the Gentlemen he has appointed as every way worthy of their patronage and support*

Public.—Now what ito you, trim have seen this Piece, think of it ? I can speak my opinion, for I have suffered myself to he rolleti up in the Act drop, in order to witness the rehersal: It is the drollest, the most inguisitive, most unfortunate, blue-coated, straw-hatted, umbrellabearing Individual, that was ever yet beheld. However, as you have attended tome so long. I’ll just fell vou the characters, and their representatives; in the first place, the Hero of the Piece may be thus noted.
Paul Pry (a person, who—■—No! he cannot be described!) .... Mr. POWELL.
f a gentleman who has wime exquisite ideas of parental authority, albeit, not Old Button / Impertinently severe, as he doe. not mention duty and obedient e more than * Mr GEORGE. 50 times in as many lines.

Crimp (a Lady that knows every thing) Mrs. G. POWELL.
Now, between you and me, there may be another character, or two, such as a servant, or so ; but ’tis no business of mine, so let it pass: I would tell you all the incidents, but I am afraid you will think it too intrusive, and besides it may go further: between you and me, I should n’t wonder if the theatre was to be crammed, I would n’t intrude, but for myself I should go early, / am afraid I hum kept you some time reading this bill. / now wish you a very good morning, afternoon, or evening, and suit your own time. I hope I do n’t intrude! but should it happen to rain, do n't stay away, but bring an umbrella with you : if not I ’ll lend you mine.

Fisher-women . Misses BLAND and MANSELL.---------Sailors, Servants, &c. &c. by Supernumeraries.
This very singular Performance commences with Don Juan’s endeavouring to seduce the betrothed Mistress of his Friend, the Commandant's Daughter Anna. In disguise he slays the Lover and murders the Commandant; after which he escapes to the Sea Side. Don Juan and his Man, Scaramouch, are seen crossing the Ocean. A violent S,,inn of thunder, lightning, hail, and rain ; the Ship becomes a wreck, and Don Juan is cast on the Shore, faint, and near expiring, when the two Fisher-women compassionating his situation, raise him and kindly support him to their Cottage. Scaramouch is now seen swimming over the waves upon the back of a Dolphin ; Don Juan (though the very Elements combine against him for his enormous Crimes,) perseveres in further Wickedness by seducing the Fisher-women, and shooting one of their Husbands; a pursuit of Justice causes him to fly. when meeting with a set of innocent rustic Villagers celebrating a country Wedding, he decoys the Bride during the Dance, and carries her off.
Act 11.---Commences with Don Juan returning to the Citv, and a View of a
PEDESTRIAN STATUE of the Mufdered Commandant, underneath which is the following Inscription:
“ To the Memory of the late Commandant."
Which soon changes to LETT*ERS OF BLOOD upon the Pedestal:—
“ By thee 1 fell, thy fate’s decreed,
“ Heaven trill avenge the bloody deed.’’
Fearless he looks on the Statue, nodding as it were at such enormous wickedness; Scaramouch seeing it, and terrified at such a phenomenon informs his Master, who in disdain challenges the Statue to give him the meeting at a banquet, where he next appears in a scene of dissipation and riot; dreadful and uncommon Noises surround the Tavern, and all is thrown into confusion, the Ladies fly, and the Statue of the Commandant entering, seats itself opposite to Don Juan at the table, who with unprecedented daring, asks it to eat and drink, which the Statue refuses; then (after inviting Don Juan to Sup with it at midnight, in the place where his murdered remains lie,) goes off, and Don Juan, after a moment’s reflection, giving-orders to Scaramouch, follows it.
The next scene is a dismal Cave, where the Ghost of Don Guzman is discovered leaning on a Tomb, which Don Juan entering and observing, is for a moment struck with horror, but recovering himself, goes up to the Ghost, and in action says “ Here I am, where do you sup?”—in reply the Ghost points to his Bones, and bids him eat them, one of which Don Juan indignantly breaks and casts upon the ground. An awful scene of expostulation takes place, but the Statue finding him determined not to repent, seizes him and dashes him on the ground, where he expires in despair.	(/>'. Smith, Printer, Southam.

OUTLINE OF THE FABLE OF MOTHER GOOSE.
AVARO, the miserly guardian of Colinette, breaks a promise he had given to Colin to marry his ward, in favor of Squire Bugle, a rich widower of repulsive manners, and as completely disagreeable to the young and sensible Colinette as Colin is, on the contrary, a favourite. The story proceeds with preparations for the Squire's marriage with Colinette, which are interrupted by the remonstrance of Colin—during the bustle this occasions, the Beadle and Rustic Parish Officers bring Mother Goose before the Squire as a reputed witch, and beg she may be punished. The Squire condemns her to the ducking stool. Colin, from the natural humanity of his disposition, opposes the sentence and warmly espouses the cause of Mother Goose, who escapes from her persecutors, raises the ghost of the Squire’s first wife, and puts an end to the festivity of the intended nuptials. Colin, however, cannot prevail on Avaro to keep his promise and is giving way to the deepest despair, when Mother Goose, in gratitude for his late interposition in her favor, makes him a present of the Goose so famed in fable for possessing the wonderful ability to lay a Golden Egg every day, with permission to give this curious bird to Avaro, in exchange for the hand of Colinettc.
Avaro receives the gift with rapture, but instigated by the natural rapacity of his disposition, refuses to give his ward unless Colin will consent to open the enchanted animal, in the hope of producing all her wealth at once. Colin refuses, and (’olinette entreats for the life of the bird, but Avaro is inexorable ; the Squire is again introduced and about to carry off the lovely prize, when Colin, fearful of losing his betrothed, gives a rash consent to sacrifice the gift of his patroness, who indignantly appears, rescues the bird, and condemns Avaro, Colin and the Squire to wear the shapes of Pantaloon, Harlequin, and Clown, and wander in mutual contentions for Colinette (who is changed to Columbine) till the Golden Egg, which is cast into the sea by the enchantress, shall again he produced by one of the
offending parties.------The pursuit of the Lady commences and continues through a variety of scenes and situations as
before described. Mother Goose at length relents, and unites the affianced lovers.

The Popular TRAGEDY of	^
George Barnwell.
Thh Play has tot so many years been acknowledged the most useful example to jouth of all ranks that <Ver Was given to the world in a dramatic habit. The unhappy hero is a young gentleman fent from the Country, and put apprentice to an eminent merchant. You first behold him in possession of as inanv virr .<*% as human nature can bfe capable of receiving, till, becoming acquainted with a vile prostitute, he is bv her «educed from his innocence, tempted to break his trust, rob his honored master of considerable sums of »toney, and at length (to support fier extravagancies) persuaded to murder fits Venerable uncle as he is reading in a grove near his house. Stjuck, however, With the gteatness of his crime, he flies in his temptress f©r shelter, without being hardened enough to add to his guilt by taking that wealth which she so earnestly Cx|ieiicd. Disappointed in her views of plunder, this monster sends fur tflkers of j j.tice, has him ge z?J and becomes his accuser fof the crime which she herself contrived, and even oblige« him to commit, here the justice of Heaven is more conspicuously discovetable in causing the wretch herself to be taken op (nt>t-tvi hstanding her art in becoming the first accuser) and tried and executed as an accomplice T he fifth a£f discovers the unhappy youth in one oi the cells of Newgate, chained, and prepared for his unhappy fate, hi» friends weeping round him ; and, With that tranquillity which nothing but true penitence can give, he i* at the fatal tree a vidbm to public justice, yet an o’-jtci to whom the eye of humanity cannot withhold the tear of pity. The.e is not in ouis, or any -ether language, a 1 ragedy beter calculated to deter youth from 'ice,or rtcomfnend virtue and religion, shewing how cautious young persons ought to be in their ehoice.of acquaintance, and how much upon then guard agaiiui theft St approach!sof sin.

BARNWELL
This Play hHifor many yean been acknowledged the most useful example to youth of'all ranks ever given to the World in a dramatic habit.' The unhappy hero is a young gentleman sent fiom the country, and put Apprentice to an eminent merchant. You fret behold ifim in poaecsidon of at many virtues as human nature can be cai able ot revet.ini, till becoming acquainted with a vile prostitute, he is by her seduced from his innocence, tempted to break hts trust, rob his honoured Master of considerable sums of money, and al length (to support her extravagancies) persuaded to murder his venerable Uncle, aa lie was reeding in a Grove near his honse. Struck however with the greatness of ids crime, he flies for shelter without being hardened enough to add to his guilt bv taking Ihac sreaith which she so earnestly expected. Disappointment in her views of plunder this monster sends for the officers of justice, has him seized and becomes his accuser for the crime winch she herself contrived, and even obliged him to commit. Here the justice of Heaven it more conspicuously discoverable in rausing the wretch herseli to lie laken up (notwithstanding her art in becoming the first accruer) and tried and executed at an acconti lice. The filth act discovei s the unhappy youth in one of the Cells of Newgale, chained and prepared for his unhappy faie, his friends weeping around him, and with lliat tranqui iity vrhh h nothing but tiue penitence ran five, he is led to the fatal tree, a victim to publie justice, yet an object ter whom the eye of humanity cm.not withhold the tear of pity.

This Play lias for many years been acknowledged the most useful example to youth of all ranks that was ever given to the World in a dramatic habit. The unhappv hero is a young gentleman sent from the country, and put Apprentice to an eminent Merchant. Yon first behold him in possession of as many virtues as human nature can be capable of receiving, till becoming acquainted with a dissolute female, he is by her seduced from Ins innocence, tempted to break his trust, rob his honoured Master of considerable sums of money, and at length (to support her extravagancies) persuaded to murder his venerable Uncle, as he was reading in a Grove pear his house. Struck, however, with the greatness of his crime, I e flies for shelter without being hardened enough to add to his guilt by taking that wealth which she so cartwstiy expected. Disappointed in her views of plunder, this monster sends for the officers of justice, has him seized, and becomes his accuser for the crime which she herself contrived, and even obliged him to commit. Here the justice of Heaven is more conspicuously discoverable in causing the wretch herself to he taken up (notwithstanding her art in becoming the first accuser) and tried and executed as an accomplice. The fifth act discovers the unhappy youth in one of the Cells of Newgate, chained and prepared lor his unhappy fate, his friends weeping around him, ami with that tranquillity which nothing hut true penitence can give he is led to the fatal tree, a victim to public justice, yet au object for whom the eye of humanity cannot withhold the tear of pity.

On Monday Evening, Sept. 28th, 1835,
Will be presented the affecting Tragedy of
JANE
Or, TM li RjriVfL FTFOR/IR«.
The Incidents on which this Tragedy is founded are perfectly historical. The Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard the Third, to answer his ambitious purposes, arcuses Jane Shore of Witchcraft. Every proof of her guilt in that instance having failed, she was rext charged with other crimes which it was in vain for her to deny, and by the sentence #f »he Ecclesiastical Court, she was made to perforin gen 'lice in St. Paul’s Church, and then to walk barefoot through the Streets of London; and as tradition reporis, perished with hunger. Rowe has produced, from the incidents ot her singular life, this favoijte play; and the wife ot a Goldsmith of Lombard-street, has drawn tears from the rich and poor for 300 seats past, and will nevet cease having power over the hearts of a British Audience whilst the sorrows of the unfortunate Jane Shore can be felt and remembered.

This Pjecc is founded upon the celebrated 1billet LA SOMNAMBULF, of M.M. Scribe and Aumer, which, on its first production at the Theatres in Paris, So much engrossed the attention of the French Critics. Its reception in the English Metropolis has been equally fortunate. The story of the Piece is at once simple and tourhing, A young village maiden, on the eve of her marriage, and who i* (we may *ay) afflicted with SOMNAMBULISM, is found in a stranger's room at Midnight! Every thing fails to convince her lover of her innocence, till he himself witnesses what he had before considered a delusion. Ernestine having retired to repose in despair for the rejection she has met witii, is seen to

Her Foot touches the Board—It snaps beneath her Feet—The Spectators are convulsed with horror—Her
destruction seems certain !!!
THE WHEEL TURNS RAPIDLY AND THREATENS TO
CRUSH HER TO ATOMS !!
Recollection seems to aid her—she returns—advances to her friends—and, still sleeping! "is jnadfi-jbappy by her lover’s band joined with her
own—and, instead of awakening to Misery and a Horrible Death,
SHE FINDS HER FELICITY COMPLETE, HER INNOCENCE FULLY

On Wednesday Evening, Sept. 21st, 1836,
Will be presented the effecting Tragedy «f
Jane Shore!
*	Or, Vhe WSieal Favourites.
The incidents on which this Tragedy is founded are perfectly historical. The Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard the Third, to answer his ambitious purposes, accuses Jane Shore of Witchcraft. Every proof of her guilt in that instance haring failed, she was next charged with other crimes which it was in vain for her to deny, and by the sentence of the Ecclesiastical Court, she was msde to perform penance in St. Paul’a Church, and then to w alk barefoot through the Streets of London ; and as tradition reports, perished with hunger. Rowe has produced from the incidents of her singular life, this favorite Play ; and the Wife of a Goldsmith, of Lombard Street, has drawn tears from the rich and poor for 390 years past, and wi I never cease having power over the hearts of a British Audience, whilst the aorrows of the unfortunate Jane Shore Can be felt and remembered.

To conclude with, first time here, the Merrie Mysterie of
KINGE
Or, ye Mt.MTTEi, OF MB OS JV OUTM FJKLfl.
* "
Being a familier alteration of the celebrated History, by a Gentleman from Stratford, in Warwickshire, called
Ye True Tragedie of Kinge Richard ye Third, containing his Treacherous Plots against his Brother Clarence; ye Plttieful Murther of his Innocent Nephews; his Tyranical Life and Most Deserved Death together with ye Landing of ye Earl of Richmond, and ye BATTEL OF BOSWORTH FIELD.
Thb Text is. of course, improved by copious alterations, additions and omissions. Many of the original passages by the Gentleman from Stratford, although no doubt abounding in beauties, being beyond the comprehension of the Adaptor, he naturally supposes (like Colley Cibber) that the Public must be as ignorant as himself, and will prefer the Drama of Effect to the Drnma of Literature.
Thb Costume, under the immediate superintendance of Mr. Byles, pere, (the hero of a thousand private and public plays) is splendid beyond description; in fact, that justly celebrated Costumier has personally visited Bosworth Field, and all other remarkable places where relics relating to the events of the period exist, and passed several sleepless nights in ransacking illuminated manuscripts for authorities to eclipse all his former triumphs.
The Armour, to encourage native talent, has been manufactured at Birmingham, and the lustre of numberless suits of brass, steel and tin harness, will, it is hoped, astonish the oldest play-goer.
The Scenery, by Mr. Channing, embraces every known effect, from the earliest Carpet to the latest Diorama—indeed it ¡s feaied it is too real.
The Properties, by Mr. Tapsell, exhibit the usual brilliancy and research for which this Management has so long been distinguished.
The Action (which now-a days is half the battle) has been arranged with the strictest attention to the wild and beautiful, by a Gentleman thoroughly conversant with the Pictorial Drama. In short, the Mysterie is got up in a most unapproachable style of magnificence, totally regardless of Expense.
King Henry ye Sixth (a very mild and pleasant Monarch, who would do any thing for a quiet life) - Mr. VIVASH Edward, Prince of Wales (afterwards Kinge Edward V.) f (Sons of Edward IV. two remarkably interesting \ Miss VIVA8H Richard, Duke of York	-	-	i	Royal Babbies)	j Miss M. OLIVER

There is a irndflu u current among the inhabitants of the coast, that the bell was cut from the float, and stolen, and that the person who committed this nefarious set afterward* met his fate by shipwreck on this very rock, during,, dark and stormy night On this tradition Mr. Bsu. has founded his niece, which is judicious, V thoRon for dramatic interest mad effect—Exvaarf fmou Panvaca.

which has been for several weeks in active preparation, entitled THE
Dramatiaed by C. A. SOMERSET, Esq. from the Work by C. DICKENS, Esq. with entirely New Scenery, Machinery, and Appointments.
John Feerybingle ........... (the c«*,)	...	Mr. UNO
“ That lumbering, slow, honest J ohn: that J olm to heavy, but so light of spirit, so rough npou the surface, but so gentle at the core: so dull without, so quick within t so stolid, but so good.”
Tackleton	• • • •	fth, Toy Maker)	............... Mr. J. FENTON
“ He didn’t look much like a Bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face Bird a screw in his body, and his hat jorked over the bridge of his nose, and his hands stuck down into the bottoms of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self peering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number of ravens.”
Caleb Plummer •••• (hu Man) .... Mr. CRAVEN
“A little, meagre, thoughtful, dirtv-faced man, who seemed to have made himself a great coat from the sack-eloth covering of some old box; for when he turned to shut the door, he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription G. and T. in large black capitals.”
The Stranger	•	Mne.WZZ.SON
“ Hi« garb was very quaint and odd—a long, long way behind the time, lie had long white hair s good features singularly bold and well defined for an old man; and dark, bright penetrating eyes.”
Mrs. Peerybingle ....	■ • • • (familiarly known as •' Dor ”)	—	.... Miss J. TRAFFORD
“ Fair she was, anti young—though something of what is called the dumpling shape r but I don’t myself object to that.”
Bertha	(Caleb Plummer’. Blind Child) .... Mrs. KING
“ She and her father lived all alone by themselvos, as the Story Books say—and my blessing 5 with yours to back it I hope r on the Story Books, for saying any thing in this work-a-day xvorid.”
May Fielding	....	. ..	. ..	. ..	Miss OLIVER
“ Tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question. May was very pretty."
Mrs. Fielding -	(her Mother) .... Mrs. HASTINGS
“An old Laxly with a peevish face, who was very genteel and patronizing. The majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap, calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe.”
SlOWboy	....	(a Ponndllng)	....	Mr. J. WOOD
“The maternal and paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to fame, and Tilly Imd been bred by public charity a Foundling) which word though differing only from Fondling by one vowel’s length, is very different in meaning, anil expresses quite another thing.”
Dot’s Father and Mother	•••• Mr. XZASTZNG8 and Mrs. OLIVER
Spirit of the Cricket	.......... Miss OLIVER
“ The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room, and stood hr fairy shape before him,”
C HI III* THE FIRST.
JOHN PEERYBINGLE’S COTTAGE—DOT S WELCOME to her HDSBAND.
“ The Kettle and the Cricket, at one and the same moment, and by Rome powers of amalgamation best known to themselves, sent each fireside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the window, and a long way down the lane.’*
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE STRANGER.
" If you please I was to be left ■ till called for,’ sai<l the Stranger, mildly. * Don't mind me.’ With that he took a pair of spectacles from one of Ms large pocket«, and a book from the other, anxl leisurely began to read, The Carrier and bis wife exchanged a look of perplexity.’’
Visit of Caleb and Tachleton. The Suspicion* of the Carrier awakened ! t
“ The good Carrier was puzzled and made uncomfortable and uncertain in spite of himself. He couldn't help shewing it in bis manner.”
THE ALARM.
“ She only answered by beating ber hands together and falling into a wild fit of laughter. Then sinking from his grasp upon the ground she covered her face with h« apron, and wept bitterly.”
THE STRANGER RECEIVED INTO THE CARRIER’S HOUSE.
CHIRP THE SECOND.
THE ABODE CT CALEB PLUMMER,
TOY-MAKER!!
“ A little cracked nutshell of a houae, but no better than a pimple on tbe prominent red-brick nose of Gruff and Tackleton. ’flu' premise« of Graff and Tackleton were the great features of the Btreet; but you might hare knocked down Caleb*« dwelling with » b unmcr or two, and carried of the pieces in a cart.”
THE BLIND GIRL AND HER FATHER.
" In the midst of all these objects Caleb and his Daughter sat at work. The blind girl busy as a dell's dressmaker; and Caleb painting and glaring the four-pair front
of s desirable family mantioa.'*
MRS. PEERYBINGLE’S PIC-NIC.
" I declare I wouldn't go to Bertha’s without the Veal and Ham Pie, and things, and Bottles of Beer, for any money. Regularly onte a fortnight, srer since we hare been married, John, hare we mads our little Pic Nic here. If any tiling was to go wrong with it, 1 should almost think we were never to be lucky again.''
THE BLIND GIRls'S CONFESSION.
" While speaking, she had released May Fielding’s hands, and clasped her garments in au attitude of mingled supplication and love. Sinking lower and lower down, as she proceeded in her strange confession, she dropped at Inst at the feet of her friend, and hid her blind face in the folds of her dress.”
“ Great God, * exclaimed her Father, smitten at one blow with the truth,' have I deceived her from her cradle, but to break her heart at last.”
THE STRANGER JOINS THE PARTY.
“ A chair in the corner, and leave to sit quite silent and look pleasantly about him it all he cares fur.”	The Fearful Discovery ! f
The Carrier clinched his strong right hand at first, as if be would have beaten down a lion. But opening it immediately again, he spread it out before the eyes of Tackleton, for he was tender of her, even then, and fell down, as weak as any infant.”
^CHIRP THE THIRD.
THE CARRIERS COTTAGE.
** He oat brooding on hie hearth, now cold and dark."
THE CRICKET ON THE HEARTH—THE FAIRY VISIONS OF HOME.
“ For all the Cricket tribe are potent spirit*, even though the people who hold converse with them do not know it, (which is frequently the case :) and there are not in the unseen world, voice** more gentle and more true , that may be ao implicitly relied on, or that are so certain to give none but teuderest counsel, aa the voices with which tlie spirit* of tho Fireside and the Hearth address themselves to human kind "	The	Carrier’* Determination ! !
M Staunch Cricket on the Hearth ! loyal household fairies "
The Revelation of Dot’s Falsehood.
•* Heaven help me ! cried the Carrier, this is uorae than all."

Dramatized by C. A. SOMERSET, Esq. from the Work by C. DICKENS, Esq. with entirely New Scenery, Machinery, and Appointments.
John Peerybingle	....	(the Carrier)	....	Mr. KING
" That lumbering, alow, honest John : that John so heavy, but so light of spirit, so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the core : so dull without, so quick within: so stolid, but so good.
Tackleton	....	....	(the Toy Maker)	....	....	Mr. J. FENTON
" He didn't look much like a Bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face and a screw in his body, and his hat jerked over the bridge of his nose, and his hands stuck down into the bottoms of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self peering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number of ravens.*'
Caleb Plummer ... (his Man) .... Mr. J. CRAVEN
" A little, meagre, thoughtful, dirty-faced man, who seemed to have made himself a great coat from the Back-cloth covering of some old box; for when he turned to shut the door, he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription If. a id T. in large black capitals.”
Tbe Stranger . ..	....	....	.... Mr. EDGAR
" His garb was very quaint and odd—a long, long way behind the time. He had long white hair ; good features singularly bald and well defined for an old man ; and dark, bright penetrating eyes.”
Mrs. Peerybingle ••••	•••• (familiarly known as "DOT") ....	.... Miss Stoker
“ Fair she was, and young—though something of what is called the dumpling shape: but I don't myself object to that.”
Bertba ........... (Caleb Plummer's Blind Child) ...... Mrs. NORMANTON
" She and her Father lived all alone by themselves, at the Story Books say—and my blessing ; with yours to back it I hope : on the Story Books, for saying any thing in this work-a-day world.”	*	1	6
May Fielding ....	. ..	....
*« Tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question. May was very pretty.”
Mrs. Fielding ....	(her Mother)
Miss OLIVER
Mrs. W. PARKER
' An old Lady with a peevish face, who was very genteel and patronising. The majestic old soul htd adorned hereelf with s cap, calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of aw«.”	*
Tilly Slowboy
(a Foundling)
Mr. J. WOOD
'* The maternal and paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity a Foundling ; which word though differing onlv from Fondling by one vowel's length, is very different in meaning, and expreesea quite another thing.”	°	si
Dot’s Father and Mother	•••• Mr. W. C. SMITH and Mrs. OLIVER
Spirit of the Cricket ...	... Miss OLIVER

On FRIDAY Evening,March 6th, 1847,
Will be presented a Domestic interesting Play, dramatised from the Works of Mrs. Opie, entitled
H? im H. AAXill r
AND
DAUGHTER
Or, SMILES AND TEARS.	'
This Drams is founded on Mrs. One's "Father and Daughter; ” a story that has drawn so many tears, that, as it is elegantly said, if we could convert them into pearls, they would form the richest coronet that was ever bestowed by the hand of sympathy to graee the brow of genius. A story of such deep interest and pathos, told with so much simplicity and truth—so mournfully intense and so brief, that so single perusal can satisfy the mind: we recur to it again and again, with increased delight; such delight as terror and pity inspire.
It has receive«! due honor by being translated into many of the modern languages ; and the Foreign Theatres have drawn ahum, dant tears by Dramas founded on its heart-rending scenes. The Italians have a prose Drasaa on the subject by Philippo Caesari, and an Opera, “Agnese." by Lmg.r Bonovoglio, composed by Paer. The French have Melodramatised it; and the German« have transferred its powerful interest to their stage. In England, Mrs. Charles Kemble has formed an effecting episode of it in her Comedy of “Smites and Tears;’* and Mr. Moncrieff has produced "The Lear of Private Life” which preserves much of the sacred sorrow efthe original- relieved with a few smiles that lighten the hearts of the Spectators.

entitled,
Jonathan
Bradford;
OR, THE
MURDER
. AT THE ROAD-StDE INN !
The Music composed and arranged by Mr, Turle.
This Drama has been allowed to possess the most affecting incidents; speaking volumes to every heart. The happiness of the Innkeeper, Bradford, and his Wife, surrounded by their family—the arrival of Mr. Hayes—the deep villainy of Dan Me Craisy—the ludicrous accident of Caleb Scrummage—THE MURDER—the affecting interview of Bradford and his Wife previous to execution—-and the discovery and awful Death of the Real Murderer, form a picture, that must at once assure the spectator, that Justice, though often delayed, eventually strikes the guilty. It is only necessary to add, that this Drama has been played 2LI successive nights, and is still running a career of unabated success.

WOODMANS HUT.
As performed upwards of One Hundred and Fifty Nights at the Theatre. Royal, Drury-Lane.
This admired Piece, Ihe most successful one ever produced since Pizarro, and Blue Beard, was twice commanded by the Royal Visitors, Ihe Emperor of Russia, and King of Prussia i an honor which never fell to the lot of any Author before, and sufficiently speaks the high estimation in which it is held.
The chance of War having left Count Conenberg at the mercy of his rival, the Barott Ilernhausen, he demands, as the price of Peace, the hand of the Count's daughter, Amelia, who cannot be persuaded to espouse the man she has been taught to detest, he therefore seeks an opportunity of seizing Iter by force t she escapes from her jailors, and lives seven years disguised, in a miserable cottage on the outskirts of a forest. In the mean while ¡tie Count dies and Amelia being considered as lost, the estate is taken possession of by his nephew, who is determined to revenge the violence done (o his con-in, and agian declares war with ihe llaron. At I his juncture the piece commences.—-When the Baron dispatches his emissaries to seize the Count by'stratagem, in which they succeed and convey him away as a prisoner! being overtaken by a storm, they are induced to take shelter in the very cottage where Amelia resides, when she recognises her cousin and determines to save him, Tor which pur[K)»e she drugs the refreshment given his Guards with an opiate which sends them to sleep, during which time the Count and Amelia escape; the tempest increases and the Guards aiWTnHsed from their slumbers by a Thunder-bolt which breaks a large cavity in tlie cottage, through which the Count and Amelia are seen escaping in a boat actoss the river, to an almost impenetrable forest that forms a peninsula, and being but one way ol approaching i1. Hus they cause to be guarded, and set fire to the forest In order to force the fugitives out, in the mean while the Count’s soldiers and vassals arrive, and by force ol arms gel possession of the bridge, to aid the escape of their Master, but cut it down to prevent tlial of bis pur suets; thus the guilty perish in the very flames ■ intended for their innocent victim.

THE
The Plot of this Piece lies at Surinam, a Duteh Settlement OR the coffrit of Guinea, the most striking and deformed part of Africa, is the trftfie that is carried on in the persons of Men^-the British Settlements of Sierra Ledne and Bulama, and the Danish one at Aquapin, are directly opposite to the Slave Trade. The object of these colonizations is to raise there, by the hands of Freemen, the productions* of the West Indies, t<> cultivate useful knowledge among the natives, and to establish a commerce which may be beneficial to Europe and Africa; a commerce unpolluted with blood—may the angel* or messengers of help to the most abused portion of the human race, sec the happy effects of their pious labours ; and may the hands of their opponents be chained up for ever from the continuations of the abominable practices, the comic part of thin play sets gravity at defiance. The author as nevet been more deservedly successful (by the elegant and energetic language of Gambia) in proving that Negroes have capacities like other men ; and the Slaves Gratitude to Great Britian cannot be more feelingly .expressed than ih H Jast speech—
‘England shall I behold the;?. Talk of fabled land or magic power! but what land that poet ever sung, or enchAtftef swayed, cah equal that, which when the Slave’s foot touches, he becomes frte—his prisoned soul starts forth, his swelling nerves burst thé eham that enthralled him, and in his own strength, he stands, as the Hock he treads oo, majestic and secure»

On FRIDAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 10th, 1837.
Will be presented the new Play, written by Sheridan Knowles Esq. (the successful Author of “Virginias,” “ William'fell,” “ The Hunchback,” &c.) called
A TALE OF MANTUA.
The numerous splendid dramatic productions of that highly gifted Author, Mr. Sheridan Knowles, and the universal delight created by his late talented effort, “The Hunchback, are too well ¿Down to the admirers of the Drama, to need praise or comment. The Play now advertised surpasses all his former efforts, and may confidently be pronounced his chef d’revet. What made the golden age of those noble dramatists of the olden time, but the poetry which they drew from the “bidden soul of things” and with which they infused life into a thousand beautiful creations—creations whose materials were in the hopes, fears, joys, sorrows—the universal susceptibilities of the human race, but whose existence was of “imagination all compact.” And herein lies the vast depth of gratitude to Mr. Knowles—he has felt that the dramatist needed to be a poet, and he has browrht to his work—a fine spirit of hope and of love—in the stern patriotism of Viroinius—in the exquisite simplicity of his child—in the wayward pride of the capricious, yet feminine Jin ia, he has idealized whatever he has touched, Thus it is with his present Play, “The Wife,” it is fraught with the poetical—that poetry which is in us, and yet apart, what in the common place of daily existence may be somewhat worn, but which exists in our remembrances, in our dreams, and on ail occasions of strong emotion. The plot of the piece need not be analyzed, the readers of a daily press must be already familiar with it, and it is a matter of conscience not to forestal the developement; suffice it to say, it is full of striking situations, and that the interest never flags to the last.
The Sun of Mr. Knowles’ genius has once more burst through the Clouds which lowered on the dramatic horizon ; and every Theatre in the Kingdom is receiving fresh impulse from the performance of this beautiful and successful Play.
WIFE
“A woman hath in every state Most need of circumspection; most of all When she becomes a wife ! she is a spring Must not be doubted ; if she is, no oath That earth can utter, will so purge the stream That men will thi.ik it pure.”

Where instruction esn he blended with amusement, every good parent will be anxious—every master will be desirous—and every teacher will recommend the attendance of their pupils. That the Tragedy of George Barnwell exposes vice, and its never-failing consequences, while it exhorts and stimulates the youth of both sexes to the practice of virtue, the greatest enemy to the Thoatre will not deny ; surely then it cannot be offensive, if it be strongly recommended to the heads of families, and indeed earnestly solicited of them, that they wilt permit the young people under their protection to he present at the representation of the moral, instructive, and awful Tragedy of George Barnwell.

111 POLL
AYR IY PARTNER JOE,
As performed at the Royal Surry Theatre, London, upwards of 200 Nights.
Tlic following remarks from the pen of a dramatic critic, in relation to this popular Piece, may not prove uninteresting.—“ Among the naval Lyrics that roused and kept alive the ardent spirits of our gallant Seamen, is “ My Poll an! ray Partner Joe.” We remember when every true British heart beat to this national melody—once so sweetly vocal. It is now instrumental in filling many a bright eye with tears, and attracting thousands to witness its representation. The Drama is as truely national as the Song, and promises to rival it in popularity. The British Tar, ‘bold as Mars,’—‘brawny as Hercules,' and, true to nature in every sense, is truely depicted. The Author has chosen a happy subject, and it well deserves the unprecedented Success that has attended its production.”

COUNTRY
SQUIRES
OR, THE OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN.
This admired Drama is purely English ; English in construction, language and tharaeter Our love of country sparkles in the eyes of all daring its representation, and when in the last scene the song of “The Old English Gentleman’’ is played and illustrated, it has never failed to have a most exciting effect; all seem wishing to shake “The Country Squire's’’ hand. The Old English Gentleman, one of the olden time, inay here be seen on the anniversary of his birth, entertaining his neighbours and tenantry in true, old English style, under the bine canopy of heaven, himself anxiously attending to their wants, walking from table 1o table, and by his affability winning golden opinions from those less elevated in life than himself but fro» whose efforts flow the riches of the land, both in money and matter.

THE EAST NIGHT OF
MR. YOUNG’S
ENGAGEMENT.
ON THURSDAY EVENING, JULY 19th, 1838,
Will be performed Shakspeare’s Tragedy of
OTHELLO
The Moor of Venice.
The beauties of this Play impress themselves so strongly upon the attention, that they can draw no aid from critical illustration. The fiery openness of Othello, magnanimous, artless, and credulous, boundless in his confidence, ardent in his affection, inflexible in hi* resolutions, and obdurate in his revenge; the malignity of Iago silent in his resentment, subtle in his designs, and studious at once of interest and revenge; the soft simplicity of Desdeniona, confident of merit, and conscious of innocence; her artless perseverance in her pursuit, and her slowness to suspect that she can be suspected, are such proofs of Shakspeare’s skill in human nature, as it is vain to seek in any modern writer.

On SATURDAY EVENING, JULY 21st, 1838,
Will be presented Wie much admired Tragedy of
viiiidvini
OR, THE LIBERATION OF ROME.
Written by James Sheridan Knowles, Esq,, Author of “ William Tell,” Sfc. ifc.
No Tragedy of modern date can boast the pre-eminent success of “ Virginias.” It is remarkable for the singular purity of its diction and sentiments ; there is no startling paradox, no metaphysical subtlety, no strange blending of virtues and vices, no florid extravagance, no pomp of words. The chief characters,—the brave yet most gentle Icilius—the honest rough-faced, tender-hearted Dentatus—the fond and hlgh-souled Father—and the sweet Victim—are conceived with great distinctness, and singular keeping. The beauty of the character of Virginius is that which can never be out of date, and of which it is delightful to catch a glimpse amidst the majestic sorrows and crimes of History. The piece blends, in some degree, the classical and romantic ¡ it has the precision of a Grecian Statue, with th# breath of life in its youngest and most delicate bloom.

The business of Plays is to discountenance Vice, and commend Virtue, to shew the uncertainty of human greatness, the sudden turns of fate, and the unhappy conclusions of violence and injustice! it is to expose the singularities of pride and fancy, to make folly and falsehood contemptible, to bring hypocrisy and every thing that is ill under infamy and neglect. The wit of man cannot invent anything more conducive to Virtue, and destructiva to Vice, than the Dranla.

The Author of this Play lived and flourished during the reigns of James the l. and Charles the I., and received his education at the University of Cambridge, where he was stiled “the ornament for wit and ingenuity of Pembroke Hall.” He was a very great Benefactor to the English Stage, having exclusive of his aid lent to Middleton, Davy, Heywood, Webster, Massinger, Ac Ac., left us Five Plays of his own composing, and one in which Shakespear himself afforded him some assistance.
The Manager conceives that he cannot perform his duty better to the Modern Drama, than by the restoration of a Play of the golden age of Poetry.

Will be presented Shakspeare’s Tragedy of
KllWtv
«Jinn. <jLw
King Lear is beyond all comparison the most affecting Tragedy that can be found in any language, a father in blind confidence, giving up all to his children, those children requiting bis parental kindness with scorn and ingratitude, rebelling against him, turning him out to the wild tempest, to desolation, and madness; presents a picture so superhuman and appalling that nature sinks from the contemplation of it. Yet Shakspeare, in the conduct of this Drama, has displayed such wonderful art, that nothing seems overstrained, the effects however shocking to humanity, result as naturally from their causes, as in the ordinary affairs of life. The madness of Lear is inevitable, since after such bitter provocation, it was impossible that reason could any longer hold her seat in a mind so formed of passion and sensibility. And whether we consider the ungovernable violence of the unhappy King in the banishment of Cordelia, and the faithful Kent; his credulous fondness in giving up all to his daughters, and relying upon their duty and affection, for the support and comfort of his old age ; his rage and disappointment at finding himself deceived ; his bitter imprecations on their ingratitude; his remorse for the ill-treatment of her whose only fault was sincerity ; his madness and death, with all their accompanying horrors ;—a more overwhelming picture of human misery, never hnrrowed up the feeling or crushed the heart.

BRIGAND.
Allesandro Mnssaroni, the Italian Robin Hood, was one of those daring spirits that seem to hare been created to correct the unequal distribution of good and evil. Chief of the lawless band infesting the moun, tains near Rome, his name spread terror throughout Italy. No place was secure from his emissaries; and so skillful were his arts of disguise, that he was often made the confident of plots laid by enemies to entrap him. He was a strict dispenser of moral justice ; if he made free with the rich, he was the almoner of the poor ; and never did he resort to violence but when tempting booty and stout resistance stood in the way. A mystery hung over his birth ; his mother being a young Florentine, who having been seduced and deserted, had died of a broken heart, and the only family record he possessed was her miniature, which even in the wildest moments of rapine and disorder, produced in him the compunctions of returning nature that shewed he was worthy of a better fate. Such was Massaroni, nurtured by the fiannitti—once their comrade, now their Chief.

The chief incident in this Piece is taken from a Story called “ The Rivals,” by the Author of “ Thi Munster Festivals.” In a burying-ground in the wild country of Wicklow, is a tomb, respecting which a legend is told that furnishes the leading scene of “ The Dream at Sea.” By removing the scene to the equally romantic shore of Cornwall, the author was enabled to imagine characters that could not have existed in Ireland, and which could not fail in obtaining for this Drama the great success which has attended it.

On Monday Evening, March 30th, 1840,
Will be preseated a Play, written by James Sheridan Knowles, Esq. (Author of “ William Tell,’’ “ The
Hunchback,” &c.) called The
The numerous splendid dramatic productions of that highly gifted Author, Mr. Sheridan Knowles, and the universal delight created by his talented effort, ‘The Hunchback,’ are too well known to the admirers of the Drama, to need praise or comment. The Play now announced surpasses all his former efforts, and may confidently be pronounced his chef tPoeuvre. ‘The Wipe’ is fraught with the poetical—that poetry which is in use and yet apart, what in the common place of daily existence, may be somewhat worn, but which exists in our remembrances, in our dreams, and on all occasions of strong emotions. The plot of the piece need not be analized, the readers of a daily press must be .familiar with it, and it is a matter of conscience not to forestall the developefnent j suffice it to say, it is full of striking situations, and that the interest never lags to the last.
“A woman hath In every state Most need oi circumspection * most of all When she becomes a wife—She Is a spring,

THE EAST WIGHT BUT ONE.w
FOR THE BENEFIT OF
MR. GEORGE and MRS. BECKWITH.
Wfrt,
On Friday Evening, April the 10, 1840,
Will be presented the admired Tragedy called
BRUTUS
#r, tie full *f
As performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, with reiterated bursts of applause.
This Tragedy is founded on one of the most prominent parts of Roman history, viz.—That of Lucretia and the consequent overthrow of the Tarqnins. The affected madness of Brutus, and the guilty passion of Sextus for Lucretia, his infamous mode of gratifying it, the indignation of the Roman people, the heroic exertions of Brutus who now disclaims his madness, and the abolition of the kingly office in Rome, constitute the action of the piece during the first four acts; the savage Tullia, wife of the King, rendered perpetually infamous by driving her Chariot over the corpse of her father (murdered in the Senate by the faction of her husband) is likewise introduced. But the greatest and most impressive part of the action is no other than the celebrated judgment of Brutus on his Son, who is apprehended in a treasonable act, his guilt is proved, his companions are sentenced to death, but the Senate, in respect to the many virtues of Brutus, remits to him the heart-rending task of judging him. The Patriot is consistent, and condemns his ton, who is executed in his presence.

On FBII>»ir Evening, September 14#*, 193%.
Will be presented, for the first time in tbis Theatre, the last new historical Play,
Written by Sheridan Knowles, Esq. author of Virginias, William TeH, $rc. called
ALFRED THE.GREAT;
’ Or, The PATRIOT KIJTG.
Dedicated by Permission to his Majesty, King William XV.
The opportunities presented by history for the selection of the dramatist, are essentially more interesting than any which mere invention can suggest. Thf conscionsness of tbe previous existence of the characters represented, adds a powerful charm to the inserest of the scene, and fdao affords a writer the opportunity of representing the most,vivid and interesting events of past ages in the most forcible and pleasing form that they can be brought before the imagination. The history of the patriot AI fifed, in any shape, abounds with all the interest of early association. The daring hardihood of the stratagems by which he rescnod his nation from usurpation—the purity and justice of his Jaws—the division of the country into different compartments—the establishment of trial by jury—have so endeared his character to the contemplation of Englishmen, that he will ever continue the object of unqualified sympathy, reverence, and admiration. The supremacy of the author of tbia production in the list of historical dramatists is undisputed and unrivalled, he has developed the character in his usual natural and striking form, and keeps awake the interest, till summed up by the most powerful and unexpected catastrophe.

Amidst the various scenes of foreign and domestic warfare that have at different periods desolated the beautiful land of tire Greeks, none can be found more eventful and important than the era which the author of tile Evil Eye Iras chosen ns the ground-work ol the present drama, in which he has pleasingly blended historical facts with the existing superstitions of that ill-fated people. Lord Byron, in reverting to many of the popular fallacies of the Greeks, particularly notices the belief in tire Evil Eye, and observes, *■ Man is by nature superstitions : in Scotland we have our Second Sight, in Greece the Evil Eye and even to ibis day, such is the received conviction in the truth and fatal effects that attend the visitations of this Fiend, that the efforts of reason are perfectly unavailing to counteract the fatal consequences that too often result from the early prejudices this national belief occasions. The fttbor has given a powerful antidote to these phantoms of imagination, proving they have too often their source in the wicked exertions of the interested and designing, than in the super-human agenoy of evil flora another world.
Incidental to the Piece, the following Scenery, painted by Mr. Northouse:— Scene I.—A VIEW OF THE PORT OF NAPOLI DE ROMANIA,
With Greek Vessels at Anchor. ^

THE NEW SCENERY PAINTED BY MR. BATTIE.
It was in the early part of the reign of George the Second, that the facta occurred upon which the Melo- Drama of Jonathan Bradford is founded, and although the circnmstance« are well authenticated, are of so extraordinary a complexion that they appear to border oa the region of fiction and romance. In addition to the excitement. produced by the incidents themselves, the Author has introduced a system of illustration perfectly novel in representation, and entirely new to the British stage. The Scenery is so arranged that the audience see, in one moment, the proceedings and actions of erery party concerned in the drama, at its moat interesting period, by a division of the stage into fonr compartments ; by this novel arrangement, effects are produced that have given a new impetus to dramatic action that mast be witnessed, in order to be properly appreciated and understood.
The Public are respectfully assured that no exertion has been omitted to produoo this interesting piece In a way that will render it acceptable to their notice and support.

FOR TIIE BENEFIT OF
BY DESIRE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE
On TUESDAY EVENING, MARCH 16th, 1830
>	Will be performed the popular Melo Dramatic Play of the
SIBERIA
Or, Russian Clemency
This interesting and successful Play is taken from Madame f’ottin’s celebrated French Work of "Elisabeth, or the Exile of Liberia.’’ The story, language, sentiments, and striking situations are closely copied from this excellent original, which has been universally read and admired throughout Europe, and has been translated into almost every modern language. Were the narrative merely tha creation of fancy, it would be considered as affecting a fiction as ever met the public eye; but as it is generally known to be founded on truth, and to be actually an embellished fact, tenfold sympathy is naturally excited by this Dramatic representation. The heroine of this piece was a character that really existed in our own time,—who undertook a painful and dangerous journey of some thousand miles, over trackless snows and inhospitable deserts, to throw herself at the feet of her Sovereign, at his Coronation, and implore the pardon of an honourable but exiled father. The late Emperor Alexander, whose magnanimity has since been the theme of every - tongue, even then gave a happy and glorious pressagc of his future character and reign, by generously granting a parent’s freedom, to the ardent supplication of his duteous child; thus rewarding filial piety, and exerting the best prerogative of Royal Clemency, the power of pardon. This transaction, so honourable to that Monarch, is, from motives of stage effect and propriety, fixed at a remote period of history. Facts are improved by the most impressive fictions. The heroic character of Daran, the unweared Champion and Protector of oppressed innocence, heightens the serious interest of the Piece, while the pathetic is admirably blended with the comic, and the most animated music sheds brilliance and hilarity over the whole ofthis varied and entertaining Drama.

There is nothing in the whole circle of the Drama, ancient or modem, that can in any way be compared to Hamlet; it stands alone a class of itself, its colossal greatness mocks all efforts at comparison; it would be no less easy to take the height of the Andes with a pair of compasses. No praise can truly speak its merits, “ Age cannot wither it, nor custom stale its infinite variety.”

In consequence of the general approval bestowed upon its revival, and by particular desire, Shakspeare’s grand Historical Play of King Henry the Fourth, will be repeated this Evening, being the only occasion it can be performed this Season.
For the Benefit of
Mr.ALLEM.
On THURSDAY EVENING, NOV. 30,1843,
Will bo performed Shakipeares historical Play of
KING HENRY ith
This Play is pronounced by Dr- Warburton and other celebrated writers to be equal in excellence to the most admired Drama of Shakspeare.
Tbe action commences at an interesting period of English History ; Henry the Fourth declining into the vale of years, bioken with sickness, and agitated with remorse, resolves to expiate the murder of his Sovereign, by a Crusade to the Holy Land. Prom this resolution be is, however diverted by the sudden revolt of some of his principal Nobility ; particularly the powerful bouse of Northumberland, at the head of whom is Henry Percy, the renowned Hotspur.
From these events arise all the incidents of the Drama, while to the nimble footed mad-cap Prince of Wales, we are indebted for our introduction to those joyous companions of the Boar’s Head, those minions of the Moon, Poins, Peto, Oadshill. Bardolph, and the inimitable Falstaff.	_

On Thursday Evening, Sept. 5th, 1844,
Will be presented, first time here, the celebrated Tragedy of	_
George Barnwell
THE^LONDON APPRENTICE.
The Moral of this celebrated Drama is intended not only as a warning to Adults, but as a LESSON FOR YOUTH! and strongly recommmended to the heads of Families, to send their rising branches to witness its representation, which by making a strong impression on their minds may serve as a Beacon, and teach them to shun the snares of the artful, and the council of evil advisers.
“ Learn to be wise by others harm, and ye shall do full well.”
“ Be warn’d ye youth who see my sad despair,	By my example learn to shun my fate,
Avoid lewd women false as they are fair,	How wretched is the man that's wise too late,
Ere innocence and fame and life be lost,
Here purchase wisdom cheaply at my cost!”

GILDEROY
THE BONNIE BOY OF SCOTLAND.
GILDEROY was a notorious freebooter in the High* lands of Perthshire, who with his Gang infested the country, committing barbarous outrages on the inhabitants. Through the vigilance and activity of the Stuarts of Athole, seven of these ruffians were apprehended and conducted to Edinburgh, where they were tried, condemned, and executed, in February, 1638. GILDEROY, seeing his accomplices taken and hanged, went up, and in revenge burned several houses belonging to the Stuarts in Athole. This new atrocity was the prelude to his own ruin ; a proclamation was issued, offering a £1000. reward for his apprehension. The inhabitants rose en masse, and pursued him from place to place, till he (with five more'df his associates), was overtaken and secured. They yrere carried to Edinburgh, where they expiated their offences in the month of July, 1638.

The Patrons of the Drama and the Public in general, are respectfully informed that the rational amusements of the Theatre will commence
On TUESDAY, APRIL 8, 1838,
and continue during the Mart,
When will be acted the affecting Play of TBS
Stranger
OR,
Misanthropy and Repentance.
“ Who bjr Bepentanee Is m( aatlelM,
•* 1« not of Heaven or north.**
The Play of the Stranger has rivetted the attention, drawn the tears, and excited the applause of the public during many yean. A more amiable picture of repentance was never exhibited on the stage; and of the many who have witnessed this representation, not one but must have hailed the denou-ment with the most pleasing emotions. The character of the Stranger is finely imagined; he is a misanthrope not by nature, but by circumstance i he had trusted and had been fatally deceived ; and having suffered in the very near and dear relations of wife and friend, he became disgusted with mankind, and resolved never to trust more; his heart, however, is not wholly shut up against kindly feelings. His meeting with Mrs. Haller, is very ingeniously contrived, and the eventual reconciliation is quite consistent with an interview so extraordinary and interesting.

LA MOTTE, in his ingenious essay on Poetry and Paint* ing, says:-—•• Were the Theatre» to he »hut up,
the Stage’wholy silenced, and suppressed, I believe the world, bad as it is now, would be then ten times more wtcked anti de* bunched, This was once the case at Jftilan, when Charles Borromeo took possession of the Archbishopric, he, out
of abundance of zeal and severity, shut up the Ttf.MATBB and expelled the Actors, He soon had reason to alter his opinion, for he found that the people ran into all manner of excesses, and that wanting something to amuse and divert them, they committed the most horrid crimes by way of pastime.
It was on this account he repented of his Edict, re-called the banished Players, and granted them a free use and liberty of the Stage,** But without recurring to the Italian history for a proof of the hatred which ignorance and vice (when they sway,) have to the Stage, we shall find a strong one at home. And it has been justly re-marked, that during the reign of ANARCHY and OLIVER, it was persecuted with enthusiastic violence.

It is not a lrttle singular that those individuals who wear the a tuft or MELANCitOLv, are so eager to point out the little vices that have, and ever will creep into our various pleasures, while the same evils, equally prominent, that exist m the more sombre institutions, are left unnoticed. I have always endeavoured to maintain that pleasure, when properly used, (and the man convinced of his own importance will never use it otherwise), is essential in a degree, and that the ingredients requisite to form a religious and virtuous life, are not impaired by an occasional engagement with NATIONAL AMUSEMENTS.
