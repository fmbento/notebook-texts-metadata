Orphan of Geneva.
Thi» Drama, from the superior interest it excites, and the lesson« of virtue it inculcates, justly ranks among the best productions of the Stage.—The Author has depicted in glowing colours the Orphan deserted, hut not despairing; the resigned hopelessness of the pious broken •pint, too sensitive to look back, without tears, to what it has lost on earth, yet too religious to falter in it’s hope from heaven:—It is a picture of the most exquisite, heart-drawn touches, equal in interest to the happiest conceptions of our best Poets.

Who has not w€pt over Mrs Opic‘s popular and pathetic story upon which this Piece is founded. It has been translated into almost every modern language, and dramatized at various foreign Theatres, and has ever proved a fruitful source of interest and tears Ten months are supposed to have elapsed between the first and second Acts. No material deviations have been made from the original story, but such as were absolutely necessary for unity of action and dramatic effect. The author of the piece, while he has scorned to become a servile and slavish imitator, has endeavoured to do justice to the conceptions of a writer who, if we could convert the tears of pity into pearls, would deserve the richest coronet that ever was bestowed by the hand of sympathy to grace the brows of

AMBROSE
GWINETT;
OR, A SEA SIDE STORY.
The Melo-Draroa i> founded upon an historical fact in the reign of Queen Anne. Ambrose Gvcinett was innocently accused, condemned, ond executed for the murder of n person who had unacountably disappeared ; the weapon of the supposed victim was found in the hand of Gwineit, every circumstance that could criminate a man «rose against him, and he was supposed to have been executed.—Gwinett thus describes, in hi« homely way, the scene *>n the scaffold—“for uiy own psrt my mind,(Heaven help me !) was w ith long agitation become r-o unfeeling, that 1 wan in a manner »nuenfible to «very object about me: I therefoie heard the sheriff whisper the ex-entioner to make what di-paich lie could, without the least emotion, and suffered him to tie me to the fatal beam, unconscious of what be was doing.— I can give no account of myself while I war hanging, only that I remember, after being turned off, something for awl ie appeared about me like a blaze of fire, nor do I know how long I hung; no doubt the violence of the weather favoured me greatly in that circumstance. What I am now going to tell you. 1 learned from my Brother, which was, that after having bung about half an hour, the sheriff's officer* all went off. and I was cut down by the executioner, but when he came to put the irons upon me, it was found a mistake had been made, nnd that the irons of the other man, which were much too large for me. had been amt instead of mine; thti they remedied a* well ns they could, by stuffing clothes between my body nod the hoops that surrounded it { after which I was taken accoi ding to my sentence to the place appoint, •d, and hung Upon a gibbet, which was ready prepared ; the cloth over my face bring slightly tied, and stiff ring no pressure from the iron, which stood u great way from it, was soon, 1 suppose, detached by ttie wind, w hich w as still rather violent, and probably Us blowing on my hare face expedited my term ny : certain It is, that in this treu.i ndous situation 1 came to myself.”—’The after-futc of the unfortunate mon was no less astonishing.

Affords Grayling the means of satiating his vengeance tn his Rival ; his revenge leads to the
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF COLLINS.
And aubstquently to the
Apprehension of Gwinett as the Murderer.

Is a sunken rock off the north-eMt coast o‘ Scotland, and was formerly very dangerous tos»ilors. The abbots of Aberbrothwick, • religioua foundation standing near the coast, caused a large hell to Ire erected on the float near to the rock, so an to ring by the agitation of the sea, and by this simple means toindirate to the bewildered seaman the perilous situation In which he « as placed There ia a tradition corient among the inhabitants of the coa-l, that the hell was cut from the float and stolen, and that the person who committed »hi* nefarious act afterwards met his fate by shipwreck on this vpry rock, during a dark and stormy night. On this tradition the not*'or has founded his piece, which is judiciously chosen for drsmatic interest and effect.

On FRIDAY Evening, August 14th, 1829,
Au «surely original old English domestic Melo-Drama, by the author of “ Ambrose Oinnitt/’ ** Bampfylde Moore Carew," &c. called
JOHN
OVERT,
THE MISER
or THE
S<DOTI£IWAIBIK OTIBIBHo
This Dram« ia founded on an old biographical fragment of John Overy, who before there there wns any bridge built over the Thames, rented a ferry boat which used to convey passengers, Ac. from Southwark IB the City. Ovary waa a prodigy of penurionsnoas ; and by a just visitation of Providence, fell a victim to hla avarice, for It is told uf him In the fragment before alluded to, “ That to save one day’s expense«, 6r.it be conntei felted himself aick, ond the next day to die, and hi# body laid out, for no other purpose than to «ave one day’» provisions ; apprehending that whilst bis body was above ground, his servant» would not be so unnatural as to take any manner of food till they had seen him in the eaitb, purposing to i«cover neat morning after the charge was saved; and with this he acquainted his daughter, who, against her own will, consented to satisfy his humour. He was then laid out for dead, and wrapt up ii> a »beet (for he would not be at the expense of a coffin) in his chamber, with one candle set burning at hi» bead and another at his feet, which was the custom of the time. His apprentices hearing of the good tidings, hoping to be rid of his penurious servitude, came to see the joyful spectacle, and supposing him i«ally dead, began to dance and skip about the corpse. One ran into the kitchen, and breaking open the cupboard, brought out the blown loaf, another fetched out the cheese, and a thiid drew a tingon of beer and began filling their empty bellies (being almost starved) and rejoicing among themselves, thinking they were in « xpiclaiion of future help and comlbit, and to be freed from the hard nsage they had etulm-ed The old man laid quaking ull this while to see the waste, and thinking he should be undone he could endure it no longer, but stirring and struggling in his sheet like a ghost, and taking a candle in eacu bond, was going to rout them for their boldness, when one of them, thinking it was the Devil in his likeness, in amazement caught hold of thé hut-end of a broken oar, and at one blow struck out his brains.-— Thus he, who thought only to counterfeit death, occasioned his own death in earnest, and the law acquitted the fellow of the act, as he was the prime occasion of his own death.” c‘ The daughter’s lover hearing of the lather’s death, made all possible haste to London; but alas ! with more haste than good speed ; for in riding fast his horse unfortunately tlnew him just at his entrance into London, and broke hia neck. These disasters on the daughter coming one upon another and being troubled with a number of new suitors, she resolved to retire into a cloister of religious nuns, and determined that w hatsoever her lather had left her by his death, she would dispose of as she could to the honor of her Creator, and the encouragement of his religious service, and caused, near to the place where h«r fut her lived, and she was born, the foundation of a famous Church to be laid, which at her ow n charge w*« finished, and by her dedicated to the blessed Virgin Mary, in memory of which pious act, and that her name might live to all posterity, the people added her name also to that given by her, and called it St. Mary Overy, which title it In general bears, even to this day.”
Such is the rudo narrative uf the fate of John Overy. It will be seen that the biography, in h&eW, of-ton but f«w incidents to the Dramatist, who has consequently resorted to invention for circumstances i!-^ ’ustratjve of the unparalleled avarice of the miser, without, it is hoped, violating probability, or (which Indeed is hardly possible) overcharging the oiiginai picture uf selfuhness and misery presented hy the curious hero of real life.

The whole to conclude with (firut time Ht this Theatre) a Comic Drama, written expressly for Master Burke, and potfformed by him in London with the most enthusiastic applause, called
HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS:
<£>r, Young iWaotn*.
This piece is founded on Rn ancient custom, «till observed in Germany, that the heir of an caute, immediately on his arrival at home, for the university vacation, it constituted absolute monarch of the fcouae. The idea it, that by giving a youth uncontrolled liberty, for a few hours, to indulge in nil his wishes, tvhlma, and fancies, u more perfect acquaintance may be mode with his character, fofbfes, and secret inclination*, than could possibly be acquired by ages pf observation otherwise. The author himself ha* stated in his preface, that “ the national custom, which forms the subject of this pieee, has %een dramatized, both on the German and French stages, with considerable effect. It was put into its
£ resent shape for the purpose of legitimstely displaying the talents of that very extraordinary little boy, IA ST l£H BURKE, in the character of Victor rtiTii which he displayed in a style of excellence that would not have discredited the efforts of the most experienced actor on the stage.1’

Will be acted the Tragedy of
GEORGE
BARNWELL
This affecting Tragedy (the moral tond *n«y of which hn* been *o useful to the rlalng generation) may
be depended upon as founded on fact- The unfortunate Hero of the Piece was executed for the murder of hia virtuous and venerable Uncle, in the reign of Queen Elisabeth : to which he was instigated by an artful and abandoned woman. Step by step she led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence by the most ignominious death.
A story is recorded (and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses) that a ynung gentleman of the city of London, having emhcxr.led part of his master’s property, was providentially at a represents-ilon of Gkoror BaaNWRLi,, at Druiy>Lme Theatre, si whose fate he wa* so struck, that it caused Ids immédiate reformation. The gentleman, bom-fitted by this excellent Tragedy, whs not ashamed to acknowledge his obligation to the PI iy and the Performers; for at the next benefit the principal Performer received One Huruhed Pounds sterling, with a card to thf following effect: —
•• DKAtt S|K,
“One who is indebted to your admirable Representation of George Barnwell for more than Life, for hia redeemed honour and a edit, begs your acceptance of the encl"*ed, w hich you will receive yearly, ao long as you are in the line of your profession.

MASANIELLO.
On Wednesday, January 20th, 1830,
Will be acted, for the first time, the original Drama (written by Mr Milner) of
>Iasa niello;
OR, THE FISHERMAN OF NAPLES.
This piece has been twice dramatised—first, by an anonymous author who is said to have been an eye witness to that extraordinary revolution which happened at Naples in 1647— secondly, by the celebrated Tom D'Urfey in his rise and fall of Masaniello. In the present day it has furnished the subject for a superb Ballet at the King’s Theatre—a grand Opera at Drury Lane—and a gorgeous Romance at the minor houses. The present piece is (a* played at Bath and other provincial 1 heatres Royal) the Drama itself, retaining the striking passages of the Opera, such as the celebrated Market Place, with the Barcarole and Chorus, and other incidents, that render it the most interesting of the modern Melo Dramas.

There are few Person* in Newcastle r Ms ¡Veiirhbourhood who are at all fond of romantic Weenery, or who In the Contemplation of rural Retirement, that have not visited raton Dene, or ns It la more commonly expressed “the Burn.” In p most ftisclnutlmr Fart of this beautiful Scenery, the Plot of tlie Drama 8 drawn; and Its Representation, perhaps, will not fail to call up Recol-«‘ctlons, more or less vivid, of Days that are grone, and Hours that have ®en spent in the tlmc-bevulllnpr Scenes with which tlie Spot Is so prolific. ™e Incidents and Situations, too, of the Piece, are of that domestic Na-®ra, that come Home to the “businesses and bosoms of all flen.”

Bolides fhc intense Interest attached to the Story, this Piece claims peculiar Attention, from being the only Production In a dramatic Form, which its celebrated Author has yet given to the World.
The original Manuscript has been procured from Edinburgh, (where it was produced under SIR W. SCOTT’S own Directions,) containing many Passages, and whole Scenes of extreme Force and Beanty, which have not yet appeared in Print. The mighty Power possessed by Der Herleige Vehmf, and which throws such remarkable Interest over the Play, may he imagined by the following Portion of the Oath taken by its members :—"We are sworn to defend the Doctrines of our Holy Institution against Father and Mother, Brother and Sister, Wife and Children ; against File, Water, Earth, and Air; against all that the Sun enlightens; against all that the Dew moistens.”

What I am now going to loll you. 1 learned from roy brother, which was that, after having ting about half an hour, the Sheriff’s Officers all went off, and l was cut down by the Executioner ; but when he came to put the Irons upon me, it was found a mistake had been made, and that the Irons of the other man. whirh w*re much "f>o larg* for me, had been Bent instead of mine ; this they remedied as weH as they could, by stuffing cloths between my body and the hoops that surrounded It. AAer which I was taken according to my sentence to th? place appointed, and <*ng upon a Gibbet, which was ready prepared. The cloth over my face beingsMghlly tied, and Mtffering no pressure from ■e iron, which stood a great way from it, was, I suppose, noon detached by the wrrid. which was still rather violent, and i robabljr its blowing on mv bare fac* expedited my recovery ; eertirin it is, that m this tremendous situation, 1 cam* •• nywlf. —Tin aftaivfatoof the unfortunate mao waa no less astonishing.

« The Brent on which this Fiction is founded has been supposed by Dr. Darwin, and aome of the physiological Writers of Germany, as not of impossible Occurrence.—I shall not be supposed as affording the remotest Degree of serious Faith to such an Imagination ¿yet, in assuming it as the Basis of a Work of Fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a Series of supernatural Terrors. The Event on which the Interest of the Story depends is exempt from the Disadvantages of a mere Tale of Spectres or Enchantment; it was recommended by the Novelty of the Situation it developes; and, however impossible at a physical Fact, affords a Point of View to the Imagination, for the delineating of the human Passions, more comprehensive <nd commanding than any which the ordinary Relations of existing Events can yield.”—From the Preface to the Novel of Frankenstein.

Albssanoro Massaroki, the Italian Robin Hood, was one of those daring spirits that seem to ba»e liven created to correct the unequal distribution of good and evil. Chief of a lawless band infesting the mountains near Rome, his name spread terror throughout Italy. No place was secure from his emissaries ; and so skilful were his arts of disguise, that he was often made the confident of plots laid by his enemies to entrap him. Hike the famous freebooter of merry England, he mingled mirth with his malefactions j ami those who paid dearest for his pranks, were often the first to laugh at his humour. He was full of chivalry and romance ,• and his mode of detention and abstraction, particularly towards t lie ladies, tvasin such good taste that they were fain to admire his gallantry, and celebrate his exploits in their songs.

There is a tradition current among the inhabitants ol 1?,	.1,,. .he Bell was cut from the float and stolen, and that the person who committed this nefarioua act afterwards
met his fate by Shipwreck, on this verv Rock, during a dark «.id stormy night. On this tradition the present Drama is cometrucled, and the great success it baa hitherto experienced, proves that it has been executed with no common knowledge •f Dramatic interest and effect.

PROGRAMME.
Peter Wilkins, with John Adams, Phelim O'Scudd, and Nicodemus Crowquill, set out on a Voyage of Discovery, are taken prisoners off the Portuguese settlement of Goa, and confined for several months; whence, in conjunction with many others, they make their escape, and boarding a richly laden vessel hound to the Indies, sail from their enemies: but not understanding the navigation of the Pacific, they are wrecked on a rock of Loadstone, called the Magyet Rock, where every soul is supposed to be lost. Peter and Adams being expert swimmers, gain the land, which they find to be most fertile, ahoouding in lakes stored with fish, forests of game, and rivulets of the purest water. The ship De La Cruz being forced •a the sands by the powerful attraction of the rock, all her lading remains strewed on the shore. Peter and John exploring their way, come to that part where ahe is lying—they build a hut, furnish it with stores, and are comparatively happy. After passing near three weeks on the Island, Peter is astonished to find a lovely female lying at the door of his hut in a trance- He takes her in, and by his care she is restored to herself. He is subsequently informed she is of a race called Uawrie*, possessing the power of flying, but that trying with her sister to catch the living creatures of the water, a fierce mvage darted on them, and by his ruthless grasp so disabled her that she could not re ascend the air. She implores his pro-tection—they are mutually surprised an I delighted. Many extraordinary escapes ensue from the wild man ; also various incidents in the meeting of Peter with his companions O’Scud and Crowquill, till the arrival of the Chief of the Coiambits, Yaurawkee’s father and his tribe; who understanding from his daughter the wonderful weapons Peter is possessed of, prevails on him to accompany them to the Land or Flight, for the purpose of overcoming an implacable foe: Peter consents, and the piece concludes with the Lasks or Slave Hearers carrying Peter Wilkins on his serial voyage, surrounded by the whole race of Flying Indians.

And surb poor youth thy fate!

Too frank to deal with all, yet cautious still;	| An English trad.smau in the words best sense.

TO THE
PUBLIC.
AS the Manager of the THEATRE-ROYAL, NEWCASTLE, has put forward a Statement to impose upon the Frequenters of the Theatre, and injure the Characters of a certain Portion of the Company in the ESTEEM OF THE PUBLIC, I feel myself called upon to expose the SCANDALOUS and DISHONOURABLE Manner in which every Transaction relative to the Theatre lias been conducted. Two Persons, (Adventurers,) COLEMAN POPE and COOPER SIN-NETT, did, on Easter Monday, bring down a Company from different Parts of England, under the Pretext of Mr. Coleman Pope, the nominal Manager, being a Man worth three or four Thousand Pounds, the whole of which Sum he would spend, rather than owe a Farthing to any Lady or Gentleman he engaged. A few weeks after the opening of the Theatre, Mr. Pope said that he had lost Money enough, and could not (or as he should have said) would not pay more than half Salaries. The Company kindly consented to take the proposed Sum, upon the Understanding that the Arrears should be paid up, (if the Money came into the House,) on the RACE WEEK.
Thanks to the People of Newcastle, the Money did come into the House, and yet, Mr. Pope refused, on the Saturday of the Race-Week, to pay the Arrears. Some few Members of the Company, who were firm enough to demand them, were paid in full, the others were paid a few Days after. The Company then played at Shields, for the Benefit of Mr. BLAND, having been supplied with Books (for the avowed Purpose of assisting their Brother Performer) by Mr. COOPER SINNETT, Stage-Manager of the THEATRE-ROYAL, NEWCASTLE, thereby showing, that the Management were perfectly aware of the Proceeding. On the Saturday following, Mr. Pope refused to pay any Salaries, under the Plea that he fined that Portion of the Company who went to Shields. I then HORSE WHIPPED HIM, and refused to play any longer under his Management, as he had no power to fine any of us, not having made public in the Green Room any Rules, (required by the established Usage of the Theatres,) which would have given him Power to fine us. This is the “ Legal Disagreement” the Manager talks of. If he can refute it, let him.—Should there be any Professional Persons in the Town, I warn them of him, as a low, mean, and contemptiblf. Imposter.
Ferdinand Montagu Watkins Carter.
N. B. If Mr. Pope has consulted any Professional Man, as he asserts, what is his Name ?

MIGHT.
On Tuesday Evening, March 10, I
Will be revived un historical Draina called
THE ORPHAN PROTECTED.
The Story of Dbat and Dumb is one of the most affecting and romantic on the Stage. The idea of a poor Orphan Boy, who is the subject of it, thrown out helpless and unprotected on the world, torn by the cruelty of a relation, from his place in society, and deprived by niggard nature of the means of appealing to the humanity of strangi tr ; and yrt. returning at last, after his forlorn wanderings, and desolate hopes, under the guidance of his kind instructor, to his Mrtb-place, his early friends, and home of his forefathers, excites the purest an<l deepest interest. For Julio, the injured Heir of Harancour, we certainly feel the true touches of pity—if the lips are dumb, the heart speaks out, and looks are breathing eloquence. The description of his being lost on the Pont Neuf at Paris—his re-appearance before the Palace of Harancour at Toulouse, and the mute amt rapturous joy which he expresses, stir what is human in the breast-—The play it a truly moral Drama, and purifies the affections by terror and pity; that it is founded on fact does not lessen »he interest, nor, as it ends happily, can it embitter the pleasure
