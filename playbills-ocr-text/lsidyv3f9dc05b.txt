We shall not attempt to describe it, for no description could possibly give anything approaching to a correct notion of it. “ Th» Good Fairy In her Floral Homo” is the nomenclature by v'hich this wonderful “ illusion” is distinguished from the

but long before the oonolusion little better than an exhibition of dumb-ghow; so that, under the cirsumstanoes, although the three principal actors were summoned at the tall of the curtain with vociferous enthusiasm—a demonstration rather suggertlve of satisfaction that nothing more than • friendly contest of orange-peel could now delay tha real business of tha evening, than of any critical admiration of the hlstrionle talent put forth—it would be a pom compliment to signalize them by name. The interval between the play and the burlesque was certainly one of the noisiest we can reeal; but as the audience was quite as good-humoured as it was inoonve nientiy “ packed,” no disagreeable ooourrenoe resulted— heaucoup de bruit el pea dt ¡rail; that Is all. When at last, after reiterated shouts for " muslo,” the well-known figure of Mr. J. H. Tally was reoognised In the orchestra and tha overture began, the turbulent spirits were hushed, a hearty greeting was aooordad to the old public favourite, and then a low hum of expectation testified to the unanimous feeling of pleasure arising from tha conviction that “ Fa, FI, Fo, Fum” was on the eve of being made 1 If manifest. The overture (and, we may say at oneo, the I *a whole of the muslo, whether original—as In the aase of the | L| extremely pretty ballad, “ Oh, this Is our haunt when the "*H stars shine bright,” so nloely sung by Miss Helen Howard— I or merely “ arranged”) proved that Mr. Tully still retalnshis pre-eminence In a department which for so many yea« ha has represented with such ability and zeal.
The story of Jack ancf the Beanstalk (often used before, by the way) Is so evidently well suited to the purposes

DRURY-LANK TH K AT RK.
i’/ i
g
There U much to commend In an American comedy entitled A Bachelor's Wife, whioh la now performed at Drury-lane Theatre, It is not a Yankee piece of that kind with whioh Mrs. Barney Williams, Mrs. F’lorenoe, and Hiss Jolla Daly hare of late made na familiar—that is to say, a farce In whioh the chief feature is facile use of a local dialect ; but, barring certain Improbabilities, a genuine comedy, in which the characters talk pure English, while the details of life to whioh allusion Is made are essentially those proper to New York. Whether the anthor has started from a French be ginning we will not undertake to decide, but, at all events,, we bare a right to infer, from the Inartificial manner In which he has arranged his situations, that his work Is, in a great measure, original. The tyro in such matters will not often err it whenever he finds a piece pat together with lest than the ordinary degree of neatness he arrives at the conclusion that the Anglo-Saxons on either side of the Atlantia
M have had a large share In Its oreation.	f „ „„
The Illustration of the old proverb, that which teaches us * ™ that “bachelors’ wives” are always well governed, is the purpose of this little ooinedy. Mr. and Mrs. Felix May.
■ wood (Mr, Robert iloxby and Miss Arden), a newly-wedde l .
„ couple, belonging to the higher otrclos of New York,
I probably to the “Upper Ten,” live in tolerable oomfort under a domestic constitution, the essential prinolpleof which is tbs assignment of the legislative otfioe to the wife, and the limitation of the executive power lodged in the TVï husband to the prompt fulfilment of the Legislature's ex. , —~ pressed desire. This constitution, which somewhat totters when Mrs. Maywood has run up a milliner’s bill luge in proportion to Mr, May wood’s inoome, Is reguded with in- ’ finite disgust by Mr. Charles Bigby (Mr. Charles Mathews),
| a baohelor friend, who, after the fashion of Major Oakley, prompts Maywood to assert his marital authority,and boast* what he himself would do if the gods visited him with a state of oonnnhial felicity. For a very short time Maywood allows himself to be stimulated to dlveTS acts of relelllan, but Mrs, Maywood soon triumphs by a feint of indisposition, and husband and wife speedily agree that the adviser of the former is an annoyance to both. By a not very Ingénions stratagem Rigby Is entrapped into a marriage with Mrs. Honeydew (Mrs, C. Mathews), a gay widow, and the second act shows u\ in with the Ironloal meaning of the proverb, how the man who can so despotically role the wives of his neighbours Is ntterlv unable to govern his own. By the reckless extravagance of his better half poor Klgby is brongbt to the verge of bankruptcy, ami wmie ne is Henpecked to the most Inordinate degree he has the mortlfloatlon to peroelve that his friend Maywood, by a judicious employment of the persuasive arts, has elevated himself to a very fair eondl Hon of independence. Fortunately, however, Mr*. Rigby is a good-natured lady, whose Intention was not to destroy! but to teach. Wealthy to an extent her husband did no1 suppose, she has merely expended an insignificant »portion of her own fortune, the balance of which1 she places in his hands, and she proves her domestic proficiency by cooking his dinner with the assistanoe of Mrs.
f
’„Maywood.
'■ We seldom saw a piece in whioh a leading ideals mor.
i
definitely carried out, and lit which the oharaoters are more plainly traced. The acting, moreover, Is In every respect, satisfactory. Mr. Charles Mathews, easy and independent] at first, subdued at last; Mr. Roxby, overflowing with con jngal afleotion, which now and then serves to oonoeal real terror ; Mrs. Charles Mathews as a good-humoured woman of the world ; Miss Arden, as the most amiable of tyrants,; well sustained their respective parts. Nevertheless, the piece does not make an Impression commensurate to it* merits, for the author, though he has carefully worked out| Ms own idea, is not a master of that art which Is required to hit strongly an European audience. His dialogue lacks pun genoy and is spnn out to a needless extent, and there Is a want of compactness in hls work, In oonsoquence of whioh muoh of his strength is frittered away without effeot. Pro bahly, however, the looal allusions with which the plcoe_ abounds have a charm with a New York audience whlo ‘ cannot be transferred to London,

RETURN OF MR. & MRS.
TO
DRURY LABE THEATRE.
% . —_ -------------------------------------„  --.
To all who have the interest and prosperity of the Drama at heart, these lines will come with deep significance. The appearance of such distinguished artistes on the stage of a theatre which is preeminently allied with recollections of the elder “ Kean,” and the great triumphs of his son twenty-two years ago, cannot be considered otherwise than as the great theatrical event of the year.
When Mr. E. T. Smith became Lessee of our National Establishment, he made no boast of the intention he had to restore the faded popularity of the Theatre, and no attempt was made to gain the public support by assertions that the loftiest productions of England’s Dramatic genius would form comspicuous features of his programme. What his means permitted him then to do he accomplished quietly and successfully, with faith, rigidly kept towards his patrons and his company. As he felt his footing more secure, and as the changes in other managements enabled him to strengthen his resources, he extended the sphere of his operations, and gave his supporters the advantage of the best artistes in their various departments which his judiciously-directed liberality could command. The crowning achievement of his managerial career has been arrived at in the present engagement, which, for the honour of the Dramatic Art, should be responded to by the public with the wannest sympathy and the most generous encouragement.
An opportunity, which will not recur, possibly, for a very long period, is now afforded to test the sincerity of that regard for the high purposes of theatrical representation which has been so long expressed by a section of playgoers, who, standing aloof from the fighter entertainments that have sprung into existence, in accordance with the taste of the time, deplore the degeneracy of the modern Stage, and sigh for the revival of a love for the legitimate. The succeeding generation of playgoers will likewise be able to appreciate the respect with which their forefathers treated the Theatre as the highest intellectual amusement that could be enjoyed ; and, in the resuscitation of a class of performances that but a few years ago it seemed hopeless to anticipate on these boards, will derive the means of comparing the relative value of the permanent Drama with the ephemeral trifles of a later date.
The memory of the “ Kean management ” at the Princess’s Theatre will not soon pass away ; and the reputation of Mr. Charles Kean as an actor—strengthened as it was, by the remarkable series of personations with which he delighted and instructed the town during his brilliant career- will cause all his old admirers to attend his performances at a Theatre where they will derive new importance from old associations. Eighteen years have elapsed since he last appeared within these walls ; and the excitement which accompanied his first engagement at Drury-lane, when he had returned from his Provincial probation a recognised leading Tragedian, possess peculiar interest in the chronicles of an important epoch in Thespian
annals.—Era Newspaper.	Savoy Printing Company, Savoy Street, Strand.—J. LAST, Manager.

^RURY-LANE TEEATRE.
<L
To display the talent of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean in' high comedy a more appropriate piece could not be selected! than Much Ado atout Nothing, which was performed last: night. They act Benedick and Beatrice with all tfiatf tone and point that belonged to the days when there was m comic as well as a tragic ideality, and the jests they bandy' about seem to float in an atmosphere of aristocratie) m mm Pjt sooiety such as it appears when adorned with then ™ appurtenances of Southern romance. The elevated rank, of the characters does not prevent an indulgence i® the heartiest “ fnn ? and one can scarcely conceive a spec-a®‘,i tacle more Irrcsistiblyl ludicrous than that of Mr. Charles Kean’s Benedick, when he stands fairly puzzled by what h®
2 has overheard respecting the love of Beatrice. The man is in a thick fog of wonder, and his passage from the state offjj mental density to a resolution to love Beatrice “hor*" ribly” is marked by the oddest gradations of counts* nance and attitude, the face now becoming per* fcctly blank with snspicion, now lighting up with -rt luxurious self-complacency that was cheering to look upon- Visa - * Altogether, there is something decidedly innocent about *
Mr. Kean’s Benedick. He has jested against love simply because ho has known nothing about it, and as soon os th<) n trap is set, in he falls, at first lamentably distressed, as weIIas j puzzled, at his changed condition. But when he has an opportunity to speak his mind boldly, when Claudio’B behaviour to Hero at the altar affords him a chance o£ being really useful to his lady-love, and consequently off preferring a legitimate claim to her affection, ho begins ter experience the joys of his predicament, and his rush into hearty lovo-makmg shows the delight he feels on being relieved from a state of ignorance as to what he was to do next —on finding himself once more at liberty to speak as plainly as in the days when ho vowed he would never become “ Benedick, the married man.” Mrs. Kean's Beatrice, on the other hand, is a far sharper personage. She is naturally gay, with a merry word for every occasion, and is as delighted to win Benedick as he is to bo won ; but she remains mistress of the position—one of those fair tyrants of tba chivalrfo age who could mil a devoted lover “ servant,” not merely as a ” façon de porter." Both the lively couple can be serious when circumstances require it. Beatrice is a stem uncompromising heroine when she would vindicate the virtue of her kinswoman ; Benedick is the cool polished man of honour when at his mistress’s behest he challenges MMf Claudio. There is nothing in his demeanour like tna i Mai “ Prince’s jester” now ; but ho is a gentleman, with whom ’
V there must be no trifling even in sport.
S For the delineation of strong passions the lively comedy,
K of course, affords no scope, but he must Ire indeed an inat-W tentivo observer who does not reflect on the amount of labout |
B that is demanded before the delivery of dialogue can bo I
I!
wrought to that high degree of polish which wo find | in the language of Beatrice and Benedick ■
■SB _ _	as spoken i
by Mr. and Mrs. Charlos Kean. The modem drama ot j real life, while it requires the closest study of nature, j offers no encouragement for that study of language for it* I own sake which is of such inestimable importance to Shak* 1 pearean plays. There were many actors on the stage o£ I Dtury-lano last night who have most creditably matin- f guished themselves when dealing with ordinary unromautio I plays, but to whom the speeches of Shakspeare are a dead I blank, of which they could make no more than the merest tyro in the profession. The character of Benedick might be respectably walked through without the perpetration of a blunder or the awakening of a single emotion, and the oommon studont might turn over and over again the , *K gardon soliloquy without finding an inkling of that varion* humour with which Mr. Charles Kean enhances it without departing one iota from the text. The two great artiste who now resuscitate the legitimate drama on the boards of Old
ta
Drury stand as the last of a sohool with whom not only the . *,r a f delineation of character, but the verbal detail of the poet an ' *1 ' ”
il»
a matter of tho utmost importance. Such a performance___
that of Benedick and Beatrice last night can never arise fro»
,* a mere practice in the ordinary prose drama any more than the art of sonnet-writing can be acquired by studying ttva _ m ballads written for Ethiopian serenade«.	.
ï î Miss Chapman was the mildest and gentlest of Hero*, a tender being, instinctively clinging for support to thé ,
|) stronger-minded Beatrice, and Mr. Cathcart was earnest tl “ aud spirited as Claudio. In the humour of the watchman there was a sad want of emotion.
A ludicrous inoident took place in the fourth act* Hero had juit been carried off, after her repudiation by Claudio, . and Benedick and Beatrioo were alone on the stage, Jjg $ about to proceed to a sudden interchange of affections when, the scene-shifters concluding all was over, slid in a pair of (9 A J gloomy " flat«," so that the lively lovers found themselves ™ transported from the interior of the Church into the middle -of a prison. This would have been a terrible baulk to lew M «I ' experienoed artists, but Mr. and Mrs. Kean quietly waited _ , till the intrusive walls were withdrawn, and then dashed j * j jji merrily into their loving protestations a« if Dothing had) * “ W happened, ______________	,

DRURY LANB Til SAT BE.
Mr. LovetVs play, the Wife'» Sort*, has always held * conspicuous place in the repertory of Mr. ami Mr«. Ohari*n Kean. It was the piece in which they first appeared in Lomlyu after their return fro,-a America, in the winter at 1847-8, end thus it commenced that iwrtion of their peetee-aieual career which, including the management «f the Frinoesa’s, ooutinuee down te the present day. On «m strength of its intrinaic merit, and also of the singitlasfjr favourable circumstances under wluoh It waa brought eat, it attained a snoceaa to which that of no play in blank *«**•> aubeemumtly produced, can he even remotely compared | indeed, it ataniia on the list as the last triumph in what, fee want of a better term, may be called the “-quasi-Elizabethan* style. That the aspiring poets, who hoped that the stage would become a ready vehicle for a* much blank rcraena they chose to spin forth, have become an os.ti.uct race ia not to be imagined, for the first article in the creed of an unlucky genius expresses a firm belief that then is ae occasion on his part to consult the varying teats of the public, inasmuch aa there ia certainly 11 a good time coming ” when fluctuating fashion will permanently mould itself upon his ewn immoveable ideas. Poets, no doubt, continue to create specimens of high dramatic art, hut managers are unwilling to produce them, warned by countless examples that the chaneee of failure seem to be is direct proportion to the pretension of the Work. Me have witnessed several poetical ilramaa since the production ef the IFi/r’i.Secret, but none that have been sufficiently fortunate to escape oblivion, and of late yean even the attempt to . create serious dramatic poetry has been hidden from the playgoing public, or at host has only been revealed in some local district, where it is impossible to infiuenoo the genenl opinion of tho metropolis.
The Wife's Secret, however, attained a great, unequivocal, unquestionable success. The plot «end sentiments wee* universally intelligible, the situations were very striking, and, though some of them might remind particular spectators of certain scenes in Mr. "W. B, Bernard's TaU of At Soiway, their melodramatic origin was well mantled bf the

Cadmir Dplavigne'» play, Tunis XT., remains now, a, it always was at the Prlncota’s Theatre, one A the moat popular play» In Mr. Charles Kean's repertory. laut night,, when ii revival took place, at Drurydane, tin1 ho«« was complrtcl* crowded, and by an siidh.iicu tliat evidently seemed? to anticipate a treat of do oixlinary kind.
Ouo person niay like this piece and another may Ilk«	that,	but all aro	glad	to ace Louit	XT-
'vi til	Mr.	Charles Kean as	the principal	1KT'
sonagp. Sir Walter Scott' made the crafty Monarch familiar to tho large-rcading public, bill for his intrwduc- i) ttoa to the far larger and far more miscellaneous pia\' going public lie b entirely indebted to Mr. Charles Keats T«, rr. (H | multitude*, tvbo 10 years ago coidd not liavo ja eked' » Louts XI. from his 18 namesakes, he is now as fauiiiU r &i ,ljt our Harry Vif 1. or Good Queen Bess.	fSi»
1	If 51. Cnsitplr Dtlavxgno wished to make theasta
Monarch nnivcysaUy detestoj, he certainly missed h'*	_
w- niark. for be U decidfldlya pe t with the British puIdk^JW” fits villanies, his terrors, ids hypocrisy, his points of strength, and his ]>oints of weakness arc depicted with such admirable minuteness with Mr. ChmleJ Kean, the transition iV so frequent from tho awful to the huimrou», slid ifie per,., son ago in whom so many passions are oon-enti »led is such a thorough oddity, that it is iinjwsMbie allogetboi to hate s* very amusing a tyriiut. From the first moment when ho come* on the stage, in his queer black suit and his well -known kill* cap, to hi* death, while attired in the pomp of JloyaUy, he 1* »figure from which not aaeye is moved. All thoVoBghjy understand him, because hois so perfectly mterj/f'vted by tlie gi'eat artist who represent« him. His fidget alxiul Ms health, with which his disposition to fly into * rag® is ever at variance,—tho cunning twinkle of his eye
Ewheu he has hit upon some happy rascality—hi* puerile delight when tho honest countrywoman pretends t* . fail in love with him, and is sure that he w ill live a hundred year»—his abject terror when menaced by Nemours --the rapacious clutch of tiie crown when his son believe» tliat he is dead—are all such accurate exponents of the inner disposition of the man that the audience are placed in a position of confidence towards him not felt in tho case of any other character. The port roil- of Louis XL
I is, as it were, detached from its frame by Mr. Charles Kean, and endowed with life and motion, without any loss of its pictorial fidelity. The one particular man, who is like no other in tho world, deport* himself after a fashion that belongs to himself (done. Those 3 who do not nee Mr. Charles Kean in this eccentric part have not the slightest notion of Ids power as a creator of marked | individuality, ilia Louis XI. is iv masterpiece of realistic ’ art, for which wo may vainly look for s purallol on the modern stage. The repeated calls winch were raised for ’ him last uight in the course of the performance were alt spontaneous bursts of tho heartiest admiration.
The scene with the peasants is remarkably strengthened by Mrs. Char les Kean, who, to her infinite credit, oon-degcenils to play tho buxom dome Martlre, and with, wondrous tact cajoles tho totteviug King,who, aiok and spiteful as be may be, is stilla gallant Frenchman. Nemours is played with a newly-acquired force by Mr. Oathcart, who especially show« hi* strength in the scene where he menace* tho life of the King, and the interesting character» of the Dauphin and Mark are gracefully sustained by the two Misses Chapman. As for thoso throe odd courtiers, Coition. Tristan, and Olivier, they ere as amusing as ever in the hands Of Messrs. Belfonl, MNiJuii, arid Lambert.
Judging from its reception, wo may fairly expect that Tunis XT. will prove oue of tne most frequently repeated pieces during Mr. Charles Kean's engagement,

(Sittingt at Jftei Prim, before Mr. Baron Chan.sell and • Common Jury.)
LAST V. DOWLING.
This was an interpleader issue, brought to try the plaintiff1» right to certain goods seised by the Sheriff of Middlesex at the instance of the defendant, Mrs. Dowling, in satis' if, faction of a writ otfi. fa., issued by her against Mr. E. T, *
Smith.
Mr. M. Chambers and Mr. Joyce were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant RalUntine and Mr. Hawkins rcpre- .
sented tho defendant.	(Jp	.
It appeared from the statement of counsel that the quo»' V ’ tion in dispute was whether the plaintiff was or was not j
the proprietor of a quantity of machinery, type, and other . articles' necessary to the printing trade, which had been taken in execution at a printing establishment in the Savoy to satisfy a judgment which the defendant had obtained against Mr. B. T. Smith, the lessee of Drury-lane Theatre and Her Majesty’s Theatre. In 1836 Mr. Smith anggested to tho plaintiff, whom he had known for 20 years, and who . .vns then tho manager of Mr. Francis’s printing establishment, /'" .: » in Catherlne-street, Strand, that he should start a business of his own, and that he would assist him to the extent of BOW. or 600L, and would give him all his theatrical printing. In the year 1860 Messrs. Godfrey and Do Laney,
? tho former proprietors of the Savoy Printing-office, became | bankrupt, upon which the plaintiff, at the suggestion of Mr.
" Smith, took tiie vacant premises ; and, upon the oondition that Mr. Smith would advance tho necessary funds to carry on the business, the plaintiff undertook to take him into < partnership as soon as the business should have cleared off & 1 j its debts, the plaintiff in the meantime to be permitted to	r 1
a draw 3f. a-week for his support. Tho plaintiff accordingly, 'tat on Mr. Smith’s guarantee, purchased 3851. worth of goods from Messrs. Harrild and Sou, printers’ brokers, to be paid by instalment«. The first of theao instalments, amounting to 60/., was paid by Mr. Last, who had also ordered other goods to be supplied to the business on his own aocouut, ' thus showing that he was the proprietor. A Mr. Jeotil, a traveller to Messrs. Stephenson, type founders, of Sheffield, would skate that Mr. Smith had offered to give them a guarantee to the extent of BUOi. if they would let tho plaintiff ! have goods to that amount. When the place was properly 1 fitted up Mr. Last went to work and obtained a great f deal of business, and as he had to purchase the paper <| he required it was arranged that he should pay
He-examlnod.—He was liable for a portion of tho price of the paper supplied to the business at the presont time.
Me had accepted bills in his own name for tho good of the business.
>1 * ^ j	J^rr Jo»tiL and others were called, and
considered the plaintiff as the owner of toe Savoy establishment.
James Souirc, the plaintiffs attorney’s ciork, was called, & a0t.;^*ve ev*uonoe respecting serving Mrs. Dowling with the writ in this action.
, iu cross-examination ho stated that a writ had been S , 8 , n*rae- bn an action against Mr. Smith, upon a mil of exchange. He bail made an' affidavit in that case.
“V?nominal plain till' in that action, buthe had never »aen the bill lined upon nor advanced money upon it* He nail not sanctioned anybody to use his name.	w
His Lordship said he should take care the Law Society Ww was madp awnMfl.ted will» those facta.	.£'»*
Mr. Hawkjtns, having addressed tho jury on behalf of “ ™ the defendant, called >
Mr. E. T. Smith, who swore that he had employed the plaintiff as his servant to manage the Savoy printing establishment at a salary of Si. per week. He had declined taking him into partnership, but he did not wish his own ,. | name to appear in the business for fear of being made bank-1gtfc. rapt. He had paid 1,2001. out of his pocket, and he was . r, -w still liable for 1,500/. on that account. He had offered to sell the busiueas to the plaintiff for 500/. if he would take eil its liabilities.
Cross-examined.—He had known Mrs. Dowling, the defendant, for 30 years. She had advanced him money, and ho had made an assignment of the Sunday Timet to her. He reqaeeted Mrs. Dowling to sue him and seize the goods at the Savoy for his own benefit. There was some little scandal about himself and Mn. Dowling. He was charged with seducing her, she being then the wife of his friend Mr. Dowling. Hr. Dowling was then inspector of police in the L division. He was in tho police himself at that
1
4m
$ time. Mr. Dowling went away and left Mm. Dowling »fc
fijuv. met* s^ww*iu|j nvus sw **	wuis svi v #si a.	w|
his (Smith's) house. Mrs. Dowling had since lived at one or jjfc other of hil houses, and many (versons addi eased lior ns *'; Mrs. Smith. Ho borrowed 2,000/. from hor. The solioitor tw was present who sold out trust money for licr. It was money settled upon her by her guardians. Mr. Dowling was alive | a
then. It was about seven yean ago. He did not consult 1'
HHPUHHBPHp	he should ^ _
the money he earned from time to time into Seale’s hank to Smith's credit, who in return accepted f _ bills of exchange lor the payment of the accounts of the printing establishment. That accouut went on for ’ some time, but Mr. Smith now declined to let the plaintiff Jr see it, although it would be interesting to see on which side the balance iay, as at the time when this transaction took place Smith was indebted to the business in the sum of 690/. 3s. 3d. for theatrical printing. Various transactions would bo proved to show that not only had the plaintiff * acted as proprietor, but that Mr. Smith had treated him aa such. On the 27th of Much last the plaintiff was asto-■ siahed to find an execution put in, and tne goods seized, at . the suit of Mrs Dowling, as the goods of Mr. Smith. The suit had gone on in the most friundly manner, the writ was . £ , served, judgrueut was allowed to go by default, and immediate execution followed. At the time Mr. Last had on - hand considerable orders for the different theatres, and when he asked the sheriff’s officer for leave to go on'With ? his business he was referred bv that person to Mr. Smith, ’	1 whereas one would have thought he would have been re-
ferred to Mrs. Dowling, tho execution creditor, rather than to Smith, the execution debtor. It then became necessary for tho plaintiff to obtain Mrs. Dowling’s address, and Mr. Kirkmnn Lone, the attorney then actingfor Mrs. Dowling, was obliged to revoid it, after Mr. Baron Martin had threatened to commit him if ho did not disclose it. He then stator! it
to bo Barnes Cottage, King’s Langley, and, when the plaintiffs attorney wont down to eubpana hor, she was denied to
him, hut eventually he served her, when sho said she left it all in the hands of Mr. Smith. Another matter which

*to bo laid before the jury was that, although the ent- was signed in the Queen’s Bench, it was returnable m the Exchequer, so that they were delayed in the search for it.
When the writ of Jl. fa. was put in,
His Lordship said it was no writ at all.
Mr. Joyce was aware of that fact, but it had not come to light until after the commencement of these proceedings. | The plaintiff was then called in support of tills statement, ’■ and ho detailed the circumstances under which he set up in business ; bow, after a time, Smith suggested to him to. pi change the trading name from last and Co. to the Savoy * ■ Punting Company : and how it was agreed that, after
B.J the liabilities were cleared off, Smith was to beoome a part:. ner with a half share in the business.
Cross-examined.--The whole of tho property on the pre- . . mises was worth 1,500/. or l.fiOO/., which ho claimed os his ' own, besides the debt of 000/. due from Mr. Smith. Ho had paid about 400/. out of the money be had earned. When in the employ of Mr. Francis his wages were 111 a week. He hail been in business liefore on his own account, and had failed. Ho hod been bankrupt once and had been . insolvent twice. He had been the proprietor of several | newspapers. He had not been indicted for bis connexion jl with a oertain paper, but had hod an action brought against
Mr. Dowling about borrowing the money from his wife. She | advanced him five yean ago an additional sum of 200/. She had passed by the name of Smith. Sho had always lived with him, and had passed by the name of Mis. Smith, as he knew a lady who had passed by tho name of Mrs. k j Chamber«.
Mr. CHAMBERS.—I state most positively in public that no lady baa ever passed by my name.
Witness.—He had advanced money to a Frenchman to open Crookford’s. He had opened Drary-lanc, ller Majesty’s, the Alhambra, and other places of amusement. He had known a publication called the Town. Baron Nicholson was the proprietor and princi|>nl writer in it. Knowing that fact lie had advanced Baron Nicholson 800/. to start the Coalhole. He had lost that. The Baron, bring i locked up in prison, sent for him about fivo years ago, and said if be aid not advance him some money bis furniture !
. would be sold and his children turned into the street. He . J accordingly lent him 180/. Lost was his servant. He was j i ; aware that Stephenson and Co. had written up from Shef-f field and said they would require a gunrantee from Last.
1| He had hold the Sunday Timet for two years. It was a j success, and be had sold it for a profit. Francis was the printer at the time he had it. He declined being a trader because he did not wish to be made a bankrupt. Mr. Brandon was his attorney, and bad been for many years. During the last few years he had had a multitude of affairs to conduct. He never kept memoranda or a diary. He bad been complimented in a Chancery suit respecting Graziani with respect to his excellent memory. He never had a written agreement with several of Iiis actors,—for instance, Tom Matthews, the clown, who was present, ha had engaged for five years without a written'agreement.
Cross-examined.—He was now 50 years of age. He was, therefore, nearly, 20 years of age when Mrs. Dowling's / affair took place. He remained in the police for a long time . after, and was promoted. TheDukeof Wellington and others ] interested himself for him. His father wak an admiral In the navy. Mr. Dowling never took any proceedings against him in respect to his conduct with his wife.
Several other witnesses ivero called in corroboration of Mr. Smith’s statement, when the Court adjourned to to-morrow morning.

him about it. "He had not suggested to Mr. Smith that ho A Ought to have a printing-office of his own at which to print h|jL the Sunday Timet, of which Mr. Smith was the proprietor.
5 3e had made an estimate to see if he was paying too much i- for its printing. He had not said that Mr. trancis was on Ki the point of insolvency, and that therefore lie wished to get e other work. He never told Smith to get wprk for him. lie was not out of employ when he took the Savoy IVinting-vp office. The money ho paid for the fixtures he got from Mr.1 Smith, He got from him a check for 511. 14s. to pay for the fixtures, a mouth's rent in advance, and the cost of the agreement. It did not oover all, and ho paid the balance out of his own pocket. The carpenters from Drary-Ians Theatre were employed by Mr. Smith to fit up the premises. He hail never stated to a Mr. Wylde that ho wished Smith would alter his pooition and would allow him to beoome a
partner, __	.___________________.

- Vi DltüRY LANE THEATRE.
The Easier entertainment at this house was neither a burlesque, nor a fairy tale, nor a romantio melodrama, but an opera. Drury lane, however, is, above ail, a inusioal theatre, and tho work selected for performance Mr. Wallace’s Amber fJrifofe--^>ossosic*l all tho attraction ef novelty. Circumstances prevented moro than seven perforeianees of the Amber H'Uch. from taking place at Her Majesty’s Theatre ; but, if sve may draw conclusions from the enthusiastic reception it mot with last night, it is likely to enjoy a much longer ltase of popularity at Drury-Uuio. The utmost care haa been expended in j placing the new opera on the stage in a manner at once j consistent with its merit« and the musioal reputation of \ tho theatre All the resources of the establishment are j brought into play, and the well-known energy and j seal of Mr. Robert Roxby (stage manager) have seldom been exerted with better result« Mr. J, H. Tally, I too, one of the oldest and most experienced of our j operatic conductors, with a band surpassing both in uum ' hers and efficient» any orchestral force ever which he lias hitherto preside.!, together with a chorus equal, under competent direction, to any average achievement, performs his duties with the readiness and ability for which ho is noted. The east, with two exceptions, it identical with that of Her Majesty’s Theatre, the exceptions being Mademoiselle f’aixqia, who represents the heroine, and JJ Mr. ftwift, to whom is allotted tho put of Rudiger of Bnvenstein Mademoiselle Tarepa, although youug to the stage, and even to the conocrt-iuom, i» already J J and with goofl right, a distinguished favourite of the public.
With this lmly’s general qualification«, pliydc.rl and intuí >
,’j i Mutual, our musical readers are tolerably well acquainted ; f ?' but it is move than probable that her warmest [srrthnms i wore unprepared for so striking an exhibition of vocal taste mil facility. Not to enter into long details, she was equally at home with tho expressive, the florid, ami the dramatio musió set down for her, giving the quaint legend “ Oh, never laugh, Sir Knight,” with all the requisite
#	"point;-* the exquisitely melodious dream song, “When *
*	the elves at dawn do ¡mss,” with that quiet simplicity of expression upon which its charm materially depends ; the *
f. sparkling rondo, “ My long hair is braided” (as well us the “rondoyfnofr,” quite as engaging in its war), with no less ry finish tlnm brilliancy; and the whole of tho dramatic music the passionate love-duct with Rudiger, in the1 soouc of the Streckiobcrjj, and the scone of the trial for witchcraft, which contains Borne of the ewfc. most picturesque musió in tho opera—with a vigour, Intelligence, and warmth of feeling claiming the highest consideration. That Mademoiselle Parepa’s robust figure must in some degree weaken tho illusion of licr perfoi m ince lu such a character as that of Marv is incontestable ; but, on the ■tficr hand, the unergy and talent she displays would more than atone fot graver physical dnfibieuci.ee. The audieiyge appreciate't everythinrshcdfd.ap planded her oantiuu.xUy;and forced her to repeat, tho arduous “ bravura” of tlie first act {“ My long hair is braided”). Mr.
, Swift has a thnoi voice which should make it* wav, being K *" A rich in -one and by ne means deficient in power. He must ¡r ‘i leain to huBband it, however, «¡nee, when foresd. it loses k*
■ nnlr'a of it* agreeable quality, beside« deranging the exact r jb*** - of tho singer's intonation. Tin's was more th.m once olwexvahla »s' night, when in attempting to give extra emphasis to his periods Ml. Swift overshot tho mark, and tiie notes emitted were I«*s purely vocal than ,» Blight have been wish. ,1. E> sc wire#» ho entitled hnusclf to \ ■ oun esogvedlv faiooiable criticism; and wo would parti- --T	'
lonlnrlT single oat tin duet with Mary, “Oh, lady'f ¡
,?M '«>u” (Act 1J. —prihaps, by tire way, tho most rui- i j Jiuirable piece in the opera), where his effort* were * f almost uniformly sncccmfui. Hi» delivery of the nielo-odious and beautiful aoln, “Hove me, nor fear 1 shall' fad thee,” was st.uppud with genuine expression, and fully • Kierdvd t)i“ hearty plaudits it elicited. In tho two,» (jatirring and vigoran» martial songs—-“ Uo, sing kew our j f.troop was firet ia tire win (Act 1.1, and “dome »wax. nunc , » i away" (Act IV.)—Mr. Swift would be more likely to create . the desired impression r ere he to exert himself less -	'::~t
atrenu oudy. The grand air of the prison-wane -“Isme, op- ” pres«od.iup! lonljing” thoughbynomoansimhflcrentljren orred, rispiin x »till fofthcr cpplicatioo before the “ideal” of the music and the dramatic situation it aims at illustrate, [ can bo -satisfactorily reached. Mr. Sanlley s singtag, as tlie _ Commandin', may be dua-ribed in one word—prr/ertiort. J j f |. , Voice, delivery of the voice, expression, style, and oxeen- » i ttou, were alike beyond criticism. When years and , familiarity with the hoards have niado this gentleman somethin;; more of an actor hia value to our	operario	-	»	,
t oorapocera will be iucstimablc. Mr. Patey,	too, is	'	’.

"V * fathers;” but he has a great deal of excellent music allottee	■	»■
to him, and of this Mr. Tatey avails biinsJf in a manner frequently artif o and invariably zealous. The word j " zealous ’ applies oven more emphatically to the per | ’ formlnee of Miss lluddart (Elsie), who never let« a pas ■ »ace escape her out of which the slightest cfTect may be ob t tamul, and who lias studied the churacb. r ansigued to her with i a eoascientioes industry in every respect to r* commended	,
.The eharacterisiic and spirited song of the Postman, “Ik -ru ^ you want a letter t” invests the little part of Claus with a -r V — certain amount of significance; and of this Mr. Terrott, not withstanding the limited capacity of his voioc, took due ad 5 vantage. Asthe King, Mr. itartleraan linked just as regal and -.«Lately on Uorecbaok as,» while ago, at Her Majesty’sTheafcr*. % mm The band «lid its duty carefully anti well ; and thus due a, f ’ effrst was given to the ingenious iml elabórate instrumental ' aceonipockt cnl« whicli so captivate musician« and amateurs of diBocnunv.nt in tlio score of tho Amber ¡Vitelo Tho oho-rises, fn which tho opera is not loss rioh and varied, soaricfar farad SO weit.
