Theatre-Royal, Hull.
On THURSDAY Evening, November 23, 1815,
Their Majesties' Servants will perform a New Melo-Dramatic Play,
called The

Child of the Desert.
Haroun A! Rashid, of oriental celebrity, learning by his secret agents that a plot is
forming against his throne and life by the tribe of Ali, the fallen monarch resolves,
alone, to avert the horrors of rebellion. Shrouded in the impenetrable guise of an
.Ethiope, he presents himself in the midst of their divan ; and avowing himself their
parlizan, gifted with supernatural power (by which he can render them invisible to
those whom they wish to avoid,) he gains their unbounded confidence. Through a
maze of seeming magical illusions, he lures the malecontents into the very centre of his
g u a r d s ; and, at the moment when they think vengeance within their reach, he bursts
on their astonished senses in his real character, and by his magnanimity and kindness,
conciliates their allegiance and affection.

For the Benefit of the

YOrh and Hull Theatrical

Fund.

*t3* The Public is respectfully informed, that a
THEATRICAL
FUND has been founded for the relief of those Performers in the York
and Hull Circuit, who shall by age or sickness (attended with poverty and
distress) become disabled from attending to their professional duties.
Similar Funds have been established for many years in both the London
Theatres—Path and Norzekh have long since followed the example. The
York and Hull Company have ventured to imitate a precedent so laudable
and praiseworthy, and the Subscribers to the Institution do not hesitate
tommilting the York and Hull Fund to the protection and support of a
liberal Public ; zvho, participating in the pleasure to be derived from the
exercise of Histrionicai Talent, is too generous to desert the industrious
(but unfortunate) Professor in the hour of sickness and calamity.
Books of Rules and Regulations may be piticliased at the Box Office^
price Sixpence.
