THE PANTOMIME. t

I t is most respectfully intimated to the Nobility, Gentry, and Public in general of Birmingham and the surrounding
Counties, that the GRANDEST, NEATEST, and BEST P A N T O M I M E of the present Season, not excepting the London
Theatres, or in fact the entire Kingdom, is NOW PEBFOHMINO AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, BIRMINGHAM, with triumphant
Acclamations from the most extensive and delighted Audiences that have ever honoured this favourite Place of
Amusement with their presence.
The novel and peculiar character of the exquisitely rich and beautiful SCENERY, the dazzling refulgence of the new
and striking EFFECTS, the costliness of the DRESSES and ArpoiNTMF.NTs, and the obvious lavish Expenditure upon this
glittering and fascinating Production, have received the highest praise, while the astonishing TRICKS, TRANSFORMATIONS,

THE PANTO
I t is most respectfully intimated to the Nobility, Gentry, and Public in general of Birmingham and the surrounding
Counties, that the GKANDEST, NEATEST, and BEET P A N I O M I M E o f the present Season, not excepting the London
Theatres, or in fact the entire Kingdom, is sow I'ERKOBMINO AT THE THEATBB ROYAL, BIRMINGHAM, with triumphant

Acclamations from the most extensive and delighted Audiences that have ever honoured this favourite Place of
Amusement with their presence.
The novel and peculiar character of the exquisitely rich and beautiful SCENERY, the dazzling refulgence of the new
and striking EFFECTS, the costliness of the DRESSES and APPOINTMENTS, and the obvious lavish Expenditure upon this
glittering and fascinating Production, have received the highest praise, while the astonishing TRICKS, TRANSFORMATIONS,
and SCENIC CHANGES, with which it is replete, never fail to create the most pleasing Sensations, and to elicit Shouts of
Laughter and Approbation.
It is calculated to amuse, gratify, and instruct every one, and cannot possibly give offence to any.
!§SP Parties residing at a distance can secure Places in the LOWER CIRCLE, Three Shillings each, by forwarding
Post-Office Orders, addressed to MR. E L I J A H WADDS, THEATRE ROYAL, BIRMINGHAM.

Acclamations from „he. most extensive and delighted Audiences that have ever honoured this favourite Place of
Amusement with their presence.

and SCENIC CHANGES, with which it is replete, never fail to create the most pleasing Sensations, and to elicit Shouts of
Laughter and Approbation.

Laughter and Approbation.

Counties, that the GRANDEST, NEATEST, and BEST P A N T O M I M E of the present Season, not excepting the London

glittering and fascinating Production, have received the highest praise, while the astonishing TRICKS, TRANSFORMATIONS,

Laughter and Approbation.

Theatres, or in fact the entire Kingdom, ia sow PERFORMING AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, BIRMIXGH>M, with triumphant
Acclamations from the most extensive and delighted Audiences that have ever honoured this favourite Place of
Amusement with their presence.
The novel and peculiar character of the exquisitely rich and beautiful SCENERY, the dazzling refulgence of the new
and striking EFFECTS, the costliness of the URKSSES and APPOINTMENTS, and the obvious lavish Expenditure upon this
glittering and fascinating Production, have received the highest praise, while the astonishing TRICKS, TRANSFORMATIONS,
and SCENIC CHANGES, with which it is replete, never fail to create the most pleasing Sensations, and to elicit Shouts of
Laughter and Approbation.
It is calculated to amuse, gratify, and instruct every one, and BMUtot possibly give offence to any.

Post-Office Orders, addressed to MM. ELIJAH W.IDDS, THEATRE ROTAI. PIRMISOHAM.

CATCHPOLE
Tlffi HEROINE OF SUFFOLK; OR, TKE VICISSITUDES OF REAL HFE,

This extraordinary female, born of humble parents, underwent t h e most singular vicissitudes that perhaps ever marked the career of woman. After meeting with niuziy strange adventures
to obtain a n interview with her Lover, (a celebrated Captain of Smugglers of the last century,) she stole a Horse, on which she rode to London in abotit eight hours; for this she was tried
and CONDSMNISH TO DEATH at the Bury Assizes, in the year 1797; was reprieved, broke out of prison at Ipswicti to join h r Lover, was retaken, sentenced again to Death, and her puriist.
Blent changed to Transportation for Life. She retrieved her character in Australia, where she distinguished herself in many extraordinary adventures; obtained a FnisE P union, married
a wealthy settler, who left her sole mistress of an immense fortune; she had Qm Sen and Two Daughters, who received the best education which Enpland could afford, and returned to sottln
in their native land, to close the eyes of their affectionate parent, who died September 10th, 1841, in the sixty-eighth year of her age, deeply lamented and revered by all who knew her.

LADIES' JOCKEY HORNPIPE, BY MISS FLEMING.
To conclude with the thrilling and powerful Drama, in three Acts, by that celebrated Author, D O U G L A S

T E R R . O L D , E s q . , entitled

OR, THE

MISER OF SOUTHWARK FERRY.
" I give and I devise " (old Euclio said,
And sigh'd) "my lands and tenements to Ned."
" Your money, Sir ?" " My money, Sir!—What, all P

W h y , if I must"—(then wept)-—"I give it Paul."
" The manor, Sir ?" •- The manor !—Hold !" he cried,
" Not that—1 cannot part with that!"—and D I E D .

AVARICE is, perhaps, the strongest as well as the most captivating of Vices. If it attract not
the earliest, it endures to the last; and would seem, to promote longevity, if the protracted
existence of the MISER be any criterion.

The next being a rising Scene, every one is getting up, and seems aware of the usual startling, but entirely expected Denouement
with which Pantomimes are generally terminated, but are fixed to the Spot, with Shawls half over the Shoulders, and Hats
half raised to the Head, gazing in silent wonder on the Scene before them.—In fact, in an attempt to describe the splendid
luminous attraction, ami expanse of glittering glory, concentrated in this most gorgeous Scene, several Printers were found

utterly exhausted, till it absolutely became necessary to abandon the Description altogether, and to leave it to the Audience to

FOR THE BEINEFTT

Mr. H. begs to M S N his Frieuds and the Public in general, that the Entertainments have been most scrupulously selected with a view to their

gratification; for the Profound, he flatters himself ho has n 'tters of the most grave deliberation- for the Ambitious, a lesson of human frailty—for the
Compassionate, a melting delineation of sorrow—for the Economical, a great variety at little cost—for the Critical, bontons easy of digestiou—for the
faslidiom, an omelette souffle that cannot raise a qualn-—««<! for the Light-hearted and Merry, as queer a budget as ever Momus placed before his
iaughter-loving subjects; and he trusts bis present Apical may meet with a response that will afford him foodforgratitude.

Mr. W. BOWEN will introduce a Novel Performance, entitL a THE HORIZOHTALIST; and in the
PANTOMIME, the extraordinary Feat of LE CASQUE GYMNASIA, (for THIS EVENING ONLY.)

ON MONDAY, F E B . O, 1 S 5 23

FOR

BENEFA

MI \ieei
TO THE PU1LIC OF BIRMINGHAM.

Nine Years have passed since I solicited your Support; and, be assured, that nothing bet necessity, whose laws are paramount,
would have emboldened me to do so on the present Occasion. The Theatre has been, very kindly, placed at my disposal for one
Night;—the Members of the Establishment have, one and all, volunteered their Services;—m_v Fellow-Labourers in the Vineyard
have advanced to the rescue of an Old Companion;—all that now remains to achieve my object is your Patronage;—1 trust* it may
not be refused, but that the recollections of by-gone Days will induce you to respond to this Appeal; in which hope
I have the honour to remain your devoted and obedient Servant,

COTTAGE OF THE WIDOW DRUMMOND, IN THE VILLAGE OF MAYFIELD.
Pretiarations far the Country Wale—An humble, honest, happy Family—Arrival of an unwelcome Intruder, and a Rascal laid prostrate by the strong arm of the Son of Toil. COUNTRY
p n l n The Recruiting "arty—Lots of Fan, Lots of Cash, Lots of Pretty Girls, and plenty to drink—The White Sergeant proves too much for the Red one, and Peter Plump proves

Country Wake or Fair-Drinking Booths and Rustic Merrym a b S - D r p - l a i d and revengeful Plot of the Villain Luke Hathaway-The Hawks on the lookout for their Viotim-LIVELY COUNTRY DANCE BY THE CHARACTERS.

THE RECRUITING PARTY, WITH THEIR DRUMS AND FIFES AND STREAMING COLOURS.
Will Dn-mmond caught in the Trap of Deceit—The poor Lad, influenced by alove of change, and in a state of intoxication, listens to the wily tongue of the Sergeant, and thus Mows

TABLEAU FIRST. *3- THE ENLISTMENT
Look at bim! surrounded by his drunken, but more cautious fellows, who eye the Recruiting Officer with cunning eyes, as he pms the gaudy Ribbons to the Boy's Hat,
T H E F I R S T P H A S E IS" A SOLDIER'S L I F E — D E S P A I R OF T H E W I D O W E D M O T H E R A N D M A R Y , TO W H O M H I S LOVE W A S L I F E I T S E L F !
THE COTTAGE NOW THE ABODE OF GRIEF AND TEARS. The fumes of the intoxicating draught have passed away, and the hour of departure sees the young Recruit with
bitter sorrow i s his heart—His widowed Mother, who looked up to him with such fond pride, as her darling Boy, her eldest and her best, hides her grief-worn face within her nervous
hands; whilst she who loves him hangs upon his shoulder in the agony of a last adieu.

TABLEAU SECOND.

LEAVING HOME.

"Come " says the Sergeant as he lays his rough hand on the lad's shoulder, and points to the door, " be a man." " He'll be a soldier when he comes back again, my lass; so don't stand
crying there, it ain't the thing, and I can't waste my time all day." And so with many like words, which serve to deaden, not console, their grief, the officer takes the lad away, and Mar?
fcr the first time feels a void within her heart!

"trial-- lEimra© wa^M.!

ASS®

ran mk&®i3 &ia©ia$!ii.

Wedding of Peter Plump and Polly Pumpkin—Endeavours of poor Mary to buy her Lover's Discharge—Villainy seldom prospers long, and so Luke Hathaway finds to his cost. RURAL
LANDSCAPE. The Disguise. THE LONE WIDOW'S COTTAGE. Meeting of the Lost One!—They looked up in surprise, and in another moment lie clasped his mother in his anna.
•' Hush !" he whispered, " Hush, look here, not much like a Soldier now." " Don't upbraid me, Man'," he says to the girl, who clings all trembling to him.

HIS CAPTURE, AND THE BROKEN-HEARTED MOTHER'S DEATH!
JE'KIN'CIPAL STREET in the Village of Maytleld. They have found him out in spite of his disguise, and march him through the Village-street a miserable, disgraced, and fallen Criminal.

TABLEAU THIRD. *3~ THE DESERTER.

Look at him now! as he walks between the armed soldiers: not much like a soldier, as he himself observed—the passengers turn round and gaze on him with looks of pity—and Mary,
poor girl, she cannot leave him. No, she follows with a quick and hurried step to where they lead him.
The faithful Maiy journeys from England, and dares all Dangers and Perils to rejoin the Man she Loves—Her timely Rescue from the wild and savage Plunderers by William—No sooner
met than summoned to the Scene of Action—Commencement of the Attack—The Fearful Conflict!—Desperate Fight between Will Drummond and two of the Enemy, to retain the
posssssion of the Coloura of his Native Land.

TABLEAU FOURTH, 1-r THE BATTLE.
Of all the thousands who met that morn to fight, scarcely a tithe remain—" Forward," and like drunken men, they reel as they pursue.

WILD SPOT, Desperate Resolve of MARY to seek her LOVER on the m.JJD OF SLAUGHTER,
The Battle is over!—the Victory is achieved !—the Glory is won!—but who can gaze without a thrill of Horror upon TABLEAU FIFTH,

*3- THE NIGHT AFTER THE BATTLE.

Oh, what a sight, is here! Of all the thousands who rose but yestermorn, these are the wretched scattered remnants! Look out upon the fearful scene! The wolf battens on the bodies
of the slain, and the vulture waits not to commence his horrid meal! He too is there, but not alone. No: there is ONE beside him, anxious to tend and comfort him; and as the midnight
plunderer, who prowls around to rob the bodies of the fallen, is about to strike the dying dead, she is there with upraised arm and indignant look, to guard his lowly form, all cold and
tenseless though it be!

THE VILLAGE, AND "CAT AND MOUSE-TRAP" PUBLIC HOUSE.
Strange Arrivals, and a Tale of bygone days—The pickpockets, and a regular Scrimmage. LONE LANE LEADING TO THE VILLAGE. Attack on the old Sailor by the three
Vagabonds, and Highway Robbery of the Pocketbook, Gold, and Notes. BORDERS OF THE HEATH, AND MA\ FIELD VILLAGE IN T H E DISTANCE. The Baggage Waggon

BONNY BLACK BESS!
When bold Turpic mounted his cherry-biark steed
His pursuers were hard at his heels;
Like wind, or the bail of i cannon, his speed,
Till distance 'tween 'em he feeds;
Still as he rides by,
The hue and the cry
Is raised, the bold robber to slay;
But all he derides,
And patting her sides,
Cries "hark away! bonny Bess, hark away!"

When the spike-covered gat* of the turnpike was nigh,
Even Turpin's bold heart 'gan to quail: —
• We've caught him at last," his pursuers now cry,
" We shell have Tnrpin now without fail."
As th.: £ste shut appears,
Bess pricks up her ears,
And "master, what next?" seems to say;
Then over she flies,
As bold Tur;>in cries,
" My bonny Black Pess, hark awav !"

From the " EDINBURGH MERCURY," Monday, August 4th, 1851.

"Since Tuesday last, the amusements have been varied by the performances of llr. Harwood and his beautiful Black Mare, vlio-c exhibition in the ride of Dick Turpin, the Mel rated
Highwayman, is unrivalled. This performance evinces a training of the most extraordinary nature, ^s the Mare approaches the end of her marvellous feat, the intelligence the animal
displays is perfectly wonderful, and does infinite credit to the teaching she has received. Her assumption of exhaustion, with the gradual loss of strength, and the approach of death as the
termination of her exertions draws near, displays the perfection of animal instinct, Mr. Harwood plays with much spirit, as the dashing highwayman ; but as his gallant steed is of the
feminine gender, he must excuse our giving Place aux Dames, and granting the preference to a lady. Mens. Desarais' dogs and monke] s fade before Black Bess and her dying scene. Certain
are we, that did not all attractions appear as nothing when compared with those at present offered by the Crystal l'alace, few could have"equalled those afforded by the Adelphi and Black Bess."

Amongst the admirable and unprecedented Feats accomplished by Mr. HARWOOD, with his Mare, may be enumerated:—The Mare will take a Crown Piece
from a Pail of Water—She will fetch and carry like a Dog—Dance the Polka—She will lie down, and unmoved, allow her Master to stand upon her p.ostrate
Body. Such extraordinary proofs of Training were never before seen. While on the Ground, the Mare will suffer herself to be taunted by the cracking of a
Whip in her Ear, without betraying the slightest signs of Life, and allow a Man, undisturbed, to recline between both the Hind and Fore Legs.

strong teeth and powerful paw—The Snake is SCOTCHED and the Lamb
saved from the Wolf.
