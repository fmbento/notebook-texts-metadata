be performed (lirst time here) a new grand Historical Caledonian Melo Dr..me, intersp
with Chorusses. Dances and Combats, called

GRAHAM;
OR,

THE VOW OF

VENGEANCE.

The Melo Drame is chiefly founded on the Ancient Scottish History, aided by incidents calculated to excite feelings of interest.—It embraces the most -Unking events of (accordineto Robertson and
Walsingham) that dark and superstition, ape—The Piece commences with the VOW O F VENGEANCK, taken before their chief Druid by the Scottish Warriors, at the moment of a second invasion of their Country by Huba the Dane, who stole trout thence the Crown, which was however
recovered hy Graham, who entered the Ornish ramp at midnight for that purpose.—The valorous.
achievements of Hay, the peasant, and his two ton*, are also preserved, who, whilst at work in a
neighbouring field, observed a party of Scots fljing from the enemy; roused by their cowardice, and
armed only with their implements of husbandry they took pos-ession of the only road by which the
cowards could retreat, and vowed they would he as so many Danes to them if they attempted to pass;
this gallant behaviour had the desired effect —the Scots returned to their duty, and gained a complete
Victory, in consequence of which Hay and his Sons were created Knights of Loncarty, after the
Battle. The Piece then proceeds to represent the hemic exploits achieved by Graham and his adherents, and ends with the death of Huba and the total ejpulsir n of the Dane;, from Scotland.
The Music is chiefly selected Irom Ancient and Highland Melodies.—The Scenery by Mr. W .
Remington.-The Properties by Mr. Yarnold.—The Machinery by Messrs. Bailes and Coliison.—The
Dressei, which are chiefly new, and comprising several .-uits of elegant Armour, are designed and
executed by Mr Ward and assistants.--The Melo Dinme is arranged from the writings of Mr John
Amherst, author of several favorite Melo Drames, and prepared and produced under the direction
. f Mr M. Corri.

To conclude with a new grand Historical Caledonian Melo Drame, interspersed with
thorusses, Dances and Combats, called

OR, THE VOW OF VENGEANCE.
The Melo Drame is chiefly founded on Ancient Scottish History, aided by incidents calculated to excite feelings of interest.—It embraces the most striking events of (according to
Robertson and Walsingham) that dark and superstitious age.—The Piece commences with the
VOW O F VENGEANCE, taken before their < Yief Druid by the Scottish Warriors, at the moment of a second invasion of their Country by liubatbe Dane, who stole from thence the Crown
which-'was however recovered by Graham, who entered the Danish Camp at midnight for that
purpose.—The valorous achievements of Hay, the peasant, and his two Sons, are also preserved
who, whilst at work in a neighbouring field, observed a party of Scots flying from the enemy roused by their cowardice, and armed only with their implements of husbandry, they took possession of the only road by which the cowards could retreat.and vowed they would be as go many
Danes to them if they attempted to pass; this gallant behaviour had the desired effect the Scots
returned to their duty, and gained a complete Victory, in consequence of which Hay and his
Sons were created Knights of Loncarty, after the Battle. The Piece then proceeds to represent
the heroic exploits achieved by Graham and his adherents, and ends with the death of Huba and
the total expulsion of tbe Danes from Scotland.
The Music is chiefly selected front /indent and Highland Melodies.—The Scenery by Mr. W.
Remington.—The Properties by Mr. Yarnold.— The Machinery by Messrs. Bai'rs and Collison, The
Or*-.-,, which are chiefly new, and comprising several suits of elegant Armour, are designed and executed,
by Mr. Ward and Assistants.—The Melo Drame is arranged from the writings of Mr. John Amherst
mthor of several favorite Melo Drames, and prepared and produced under the direction of Mr. M. Corri.

THEATRE-ROYAL, HULL.
B E N E F I T OF

Mr.

PRITCHARD,

Who has the honor of announcing the following Entertainments to his Friends, and the Sapporters of the Drama; in the selection he has sedulously endeavoured to present such Pieces as
he hopes will give general satisfaction ; and respectfully assures the Patrons of the Theatre, that
he has ever held in view the words of Dr. Johnson, that
." He who lives to please, must please to live.11
He may not have bad the pleasure to succeed, but he has at least the pleasing reflection to know
the failure arose from the want of ability and not the inclination.
I t is with regret that the period is fast advancing when he must bid them farewell; a t the same
time he begs most respectfully to assure his Friends and the Public in general, it will ever be a
source of pride to reflect, that, in the discharge of his public duty, he has uniformly received the
most flattering marks of their approbation, the recollection of which will be most gratefully
cherished.

On FRIDAY Evening, December 27th, 1822.
His Majesty's Servants will perform Colman's Play of The

JfMiHiHtuineers.

Mr. Hammond,

Who most respectfully begs to announce lite revival of two bighl- ponutar and interesting
Pieces, viz. The E X I L E , and The MILLER AND H I S MEN, both of which have lor several
years been laid aside; and presumes te hope that the above entertainments, from their well
kuan-n merit, will attract towards his Night a share of public notice a^itl Ijivour, for which Jie
lull ever consider himself higti!j honored.

HU Majesty's Servants w ill perform that highly interesting and popular I>raaia,^i,n|ersjicrs*d .villi
JVusic, called The

Or, The Deserts of Siberia.
The Subject of this Piece is founded on an Historical Fact, which occurred in the Kussi...
Empire, and hi>s since been translated into English—forming the interesting Novel of "Elizabeth"
or " The Exile of Siberia," from wt-icil thi.3 Piay is taken. No imagination could have formed
Actions so heroic. Sentiments so noble—*he h e a r t alone could have inspired them. The
Daughter who conceived the glorious design of deli ye ring a Fat hgr from Ex.j4p, and carried it
into Execution, in defiance of iotercejitiiig Mountains of Sue-; really existed; and Alexina
holds up to Youth a rare Example of filial Piety—ahev'S'.r.M.ift. Child, dutiful, affectionate and
enterprising, is capable of performing in the service of a Parent.

COLIN CLUMP's
VISIT TO

HULL;

With the disasterous accident of losing his
Sweetheart Nan, who ran away with Humphrey
Woodcnjaws.
Sung at the Theatre Royal, Hull, January

10, 1823.

I'ze bad, and warsc than that, and so you'll all
allow.
For I've lost my sweetheart Nan, and I don't
know what to d o ;
I raves both nightand day, I'ze heartless asa stone
I'ze wasted all away, till I'ze nought but skin
and bone.
Oh, Fol de rol, &c.
Together we comchere to view this fineHull town.
T o see the grecnland ships, and wander up and
down,
KingWilliam and his horse, as I was staring at it,
Na.i rau away wi' Humphrey Woodeojaws, odd
rot it.
Oh, Fol de rol, &c.
So oft' I set to seek her up and down the streets,
And ax'd if they had seen her, every one I meets,
They tell'd i'd Blanket-Row that she was on the
pier,
An' they said she was gone off by steam, when
1 got there.
Oh, Fol de rol, &c.
Aboard o't steam packet I went, but there was
such noise and reek,
When I ax'd for our N a n , th«y couldn't hear me
speak;
So as Ifound she wasn't there, ashore I made my
way,
I h c r c I met G—1 J—r—s, who said she was off
'tid play.
Oh, Fol de rol, &c.
'Tid playhouse then I went, Oh dear! the folks
were merry.
They were acting—what d'ye call it ! Oh ! 'twas
" Tom and J e r r y , "
Such funny pranks, good lack, I laught till
nearly dead,
They box'd a Charly first, and then they broke
his head.
Oh, Fol de rol, &c.
'Tid watchhouse then at last these three fine
blades were taken,

After which,first lime in Hull, a new Melo Dnme (founded on facts) which ha, been performed in
London for three succcesive years with the most unexampled success, called

Richard Tiirpin
The Yorkshire

Outlaw!!

The unexampled acts of Robl ry committed by this notorious offender, the rapidity with
which he accomplished his purposes in various parts, so quickly in succession, together with
bis hair-breadth escapes by which for a long time he evaded the hand nf Justice, formed a history
of so remarkable a character that Mr. W. Barrymore, an Author belonging to one of the London
Theatres, was induced to write aMelo-Drame on the subject.—It was first performed™ London,
about ft ree years since, intended only as a temporary novelty for a few nights, but its success
was so lt> - beyond expectation, that it was revived with many expensive alterations and improvements during the two following seasons; and its success up to the last night of its performance
appeared rather encreased than abated.—The Melo-Drame now offered to the Hull audience, has
been collected from the original M S with several improvements by an eminent Author of one of
the London Theatres, through whose interest a copy has been obtained with much pains and
expense.

to the last, all is interetting, all is natural; every Sentence of the Production, is either
tmeetly pathetic or horribly sublimt. Yet the highest merit of the Play, is the MORAL
which it contains;—the Unfortunate should see it, and be taught PATIENCE; the
Fortunate, and learn GRATITUDE TO DIVINE PROVIDENCE-

A PICTURE O F HULL,
Or, Jacob Gawkey's Rambles,
W R I T T E N A N D RECITED B Y MR. Y A R N 0 L D , AT T H E THEATRE ROYAL,

Speaking as he enter*,
What are you at now, what are you arter ?
I beant a ganging home again b y water.
Comes forward.
I beg your pardon sure for this mishap,
And hope you'll excuse a simple country chap;
I just cont'd fraup yonder (Pointing to Upper Gallery)
and chanced for to meet,
Some Sailors as I ganged me down into the street,
Yon call'd me a bumpkin, and said I mun cum,
With them to a Packet and thefd send me home,
But I run'd away and then up here 1 got,
Lest they should send me home whether I would or not,
And so now as I am here I'll just make bold to name,
The sights I have seen, sin to Hull I first came,
In our town the folks said and it right glad,
That in Hull they'd be kind to a poorcountry lad,
So forfiist lime in my life I set sail in a Packet,
But I were main fraid it made sic a racket,
And what was the cause of it I neer could dream
Till I found stead ofsailing they were ganging by steam,
But I was safe landed on yonder fine Pier,
When folks said I'd come just in time for Hull Fair;
The first sight I see'.l I shall never forget,
There were sic crowds of folks and of Shows sica set,
There were Riders and Tumblers & Punch & his Wife,
And Wild Beasts alive ! tis'true on my Iifie;
To the Docks I next went wi'r heart full of glee
There what a wonderful sight did I see,
Ships that were com'd from beyond foreign Seas
As thick as a forest thats fill'd full of Trees,
I seed sic lots of Sailor, they're rare jolly Dogs,
They glory in frolic, fun, lasses and grog.
Next the Dock sheds I seed fill'd wi' Goods of all sorts.
Some ganging abroad, some just com'd into Port..
The Garrison what a fine place that is sure.
And Cannons and Guns I ne'en seed sic a store.

*
J- n

HOtVV

HULL.

In the Ship Yards lord there what a sight I did see,
Ships bigger then houses a making for sea.
Then there's sic a fine Market where all things are sold.
And just by is King William cut out iu Gold.
Good laws what fine Streets and of Shops sica range,
And I seed the Town-Hall, Custom-House and Exchange.
Next the Charity and Trinity Houses renown
The support of Poor Seamen and the pride of the town.
Both the Work-house and Free-schools your charity tells
But to help those in need Yorkshire always excels;
Then theres such fine Churches built sic a hight.
And to here the bells Ring, fills all hearts with delight.
Then the Gas Lights—hey dear they arepratty to see,
But above all that Tall Lantern to light Ships from Sea,
At the Infirmary and Jail to a peepl have had.
They both built I'm told to cure folks that are bad ;
I got treated yo.i night to the Play-house so merry,
To see Life in Lunnun as did Tom and Jerry,
Forroguing I'm suie Luunun bangs other towns,
There a Chap gi for a broken hack Forty Pound.
Then were there singi ng and dancing and sic a G rand Ball
And Boxers and Gamblers, and Beggars and all.
But those folks wi queer faces, they made the most fun,
And a Lawyer away f.om the Devil did run.
W h e n we come into Street, there was a "bonny row sure,
Tom and Jerry were acting, outside the Play Door;
Some were milling a Charley, some his Lantern had stole.
Some got broken heads, and some got iuto Black-hole ;
1 have seen other sights which some day shall be told.
But no sight like this did I ever behold;
Tls seeing a poor simple Lad so befriended,
Who will Gratitude feel, tillhis life it be ended.
Going—Returns,
Long may Commerce waft from every shore,
Unnumbered blessings to increase the store,
Of those kind friends, brought at a Stranger's call,
Who heart-felt thanks he humbly gives to all.
