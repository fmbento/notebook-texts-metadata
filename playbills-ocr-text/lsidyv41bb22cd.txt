Inconvenience to many Ladies and Gentlemen, whofe Attendance they hope for, by the unfeafonably late
Hour at which the Romance must have commenced. T h e y have not therefore provided a Multiplicity of
incongruous Pieces; and they trust, it will be deemed a more fit Expreffion of their Gratitude, as veil as
more Satisfactory to the Audience, that they have rather endeavoured to make the Reprefehtatlon of the
pleafant, chaste, and interesting Comedy of our I M M O R T A L B A R D , with that of the fafcinating Romance
of C Y M O N , in Some Degree adequate to their relpective Merits. T h e Songs chofen will barely fill up the
Vacuum that must othcrwifo have occurred between the Play and Entertainment, and (hough the Performance must: Rill neeeflarily be long, yet, by punctually beginning at the promiied Horn, and proceeding
Spiritedly through the Buiinefs, Care will be taken that the Audience ihall not be detained unrcaionably late.

BY PARTICULAR D E S I R E .
ON MONDAY EVENING, MARCH 15,1830,
Will be presented L I L L O ' S TRAGEDY of

GEORGE BARNWELL;
Or, THE LONDON MERCHANT.
THIS affecting Tragedy (the moral tendency of which has been «o beneficial to the rising generation), w>i founded upon fact
The unfortunate hero of the piece, was executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uti.lt>, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth j
to which he was mitigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned Woman : step by step she led the unwary Youth to the last cruet
deed, which terminated a miserable existence, by the most ignominious death.
A story is reported, and the (act can be proved by many living witnesses, that a young Gentleman of the Cily of Lsndon, having
embezzled part of hi, Master's propertv, was providentially at the representation of " GEORGE BARNWELL," at Drury Lane, when the
admirable actor, Mr. Moss, personated George Barnwell, at whose fate he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition
and refoitnation. The Gentleman so benefited by this excellent Tragedy was not ashamed to own his obligation to the Play and Performer, for, at every subsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Moss received a hundred pounds sterling, with a card to the following effect:
" Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of G i o a s s BARNWRLL, for more than life!—for his redeemed
" honour and credit!—begs your acceptance of tlie enclosed, which sum you will receive yearly, as long as you continue in your
" prufessitin. Happy am I to acknowledge that the Stage has prevented me from ruin and di-grace. • George Barnwell' snipped
" me hi my mad career, and saved me irom an ignominious death.
" 1 am, &c. «
"
A celebrated and learned Divine observes, that " Fathers and heads of families, whose duty it is to watch over and guide the
*' morals of the rising generation, would do well to permit young people under their direction, to be present at the Performance ot
" this excellent Tragedy, in which instruction is blended with amusement."

To conclude with (third lime at this Theatre) the highly popular Nautical Drama, called

THE PILOT
A TAiLE m T H E S E A .

This admirable Drama i, founded on the well known Tale of THE PILOT, written by Mr. COOPER, the American Novelist; and was
performed upwards of TWO HUNDRED NIGHTS on itsfirstProduction. The Tale possesses considerable Spirit, EneigT, and B-ddncw of
Character and Colouiing that mark an original Genius. The highly wrought Character of LONG TOM COFFIN is a Theme ol universal
Admiiation ;—the deep-toned Passion and Romance of his Nature, blended as it is with his rich Nautical Humour and Phraseology, complete the
PICTURE OF A SAILOR, which every one pronounces perfect. The balf-yankce, half-cockney Ca,t. BOROUGHCLIFFE, a Galimaufr,
of Amorousness, Cowardice, and Military Swagger, and his Attendant, SERGEANT DRILL, are very entertaining Personages ; and such is
the deep Interest and Humour attached 10 the whole Tale, both in Character and Subject, that all concur in awarding it unqualified Pvaise !! !

To conclude with, a NEW MELO-DRAMA (never acted here), called

AMBROSE G W I N E T T ;
or, A Sea Side Story.

WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF "BLACK EYED SUSAN."
This is one of the very best Dramas the Stage has produced for some time, and has the rare merit, in these
translating limes, of being purely " English from top to toe." The language is unaffected, forcible, and appropriate;
the eharacters arc pleasingly drawn ; the incidents follow each other naturally and dramatically, and the plot is managed
with a degree of ease and skill, not usually manifested in productions of this grade. The interest is extremely well
sustained throughout: pity and suspense are alternately excited, and unmixed satisfaction attends the denouement.
Founded on facts, the main events of the real narrative have been preserved and heightened by the introduction of the
usual dramatic concomitants, love and jealousy, with a considerable degree of tact. Fact and fiction mutually aid
each other. The circumstances that gave birth to the Drama, occurred in the Reign of Queen Anne. Ambrose
G winett, the hero of the tale, was long familiar to our grandsires as the lame beggar that swept the crossing in the then
almost Village of' Charing.' Being on a visit with his relations, three horsemen arrive, who arr.st him in the
name of the Queen, to his infinite surprise, for murder and robbery. The unfortunate man is tried, condemned,
and executed. Through some strange accident, the man yet lived, his groans were heard from the gibbet, and he
was relieved from his frightful situation by his master's dairy-maid; he immediately took ship, went abroad, and
encountered Collins, the supposed victim, who it appeared had been taken from his home by a press-gang. Ambrose,
utter enduring many perils, returned to h i . native land: poor and a cripple, he swept the road at Charing Cross. Such
is the rapid narrative of the events, which, in the present instance, have employed the dramatist.

A lapse of eighteen Years is supposed to have taken place between the second and third Acts.

appearance, was denominated a Grand National Play, and certainly no piece ever combined Sentiment, of
lism so peculiarly adapted to the feeling, of the English People. No Play, in the annals of Dramatic History,
•eer, met with such universal suffrage, or ever drew to the Metropolitan or Provincial Theatres tbrongl»ntthe
uses. In proof of the latter assertion, it was calculated to have produced to the Drury-Lane Treasury above
the best Works of the renowned German writer, Kotzebue, (whose life has so recently fallen a sacrifice to the
poutioal assassin,) it had the good fortune to acquire additional laurels and increased honours, on its bei." given
t»
nglish garb. The classic pen of a Sheridan, above the dull drudgery of a mere translation, caught the bold design tnd
fire Oi
ithout its faults, and transfused into this admired production, his own inimitable eleganee of genius. The name of
Sherida..
carry it down the stream of time to posterity, the surest passport of Dramatic Fame—a name that shall immortalise
the British litem,, ..... in, ter wherever our language is spoken or understood ; and like that of our divine Shakspcare, has raised eur re.
l.utation in the scale of Dramatic Taste and Elegance, above that of every rival Nation.

'

This Corned, is decidedly one of the best Modern Production,, and has been most eminently successful in London, but it would be
.njust to its iherits to view that success ns the only criterion of its excellence. The characters, which are so finely drawn as to present a
perfect view of Human Nature on the perusal in the closet, increase in effect by representation on the stajje, from the knowledge the Author
has displayed in Dramatic situations. It would be useless to comment further on those beauties which have been duU appreciated by tbe
most critical audience in the world.

This remarkable point in our naval history look place, as is well know., in the year 1797, and was emphatically called by the sailor,
the BREEZE at the Nore. The extraordinary and masterly or-aniaation of their system struck terror into the stoutest hearts, and called forth
oharaaters and situations in themselves so dramatic, that .mall skill was required in the author to arrange them for representation. The
noble use made by the seamen of the mighty power in their hands, is now a subject of astonishment to all, and realises, more forcibly than
any other point in history, the romantic gailantrv of a British Sailor. L.tely, the public att.nlion ha. been more particular!) directed
towards the Bulwark of Britain than before; and ihe far.iaaied novel of the " King*. Own," and this Drama, both relative to these sub
jeet., have excited more attention throughout the country than any literary productions of tbe day.

• I M H^lPHyHKA H L o

This Comedy, Originally the Tartujfe of Molinre, first translated and adapted to British habits by Cibber, and subsequently assuming its
present form and name, under the skilful revisal of Bickerttaff, has, in all its various applications, been found a useful antidote to the
cowardly and contemptable vice which is the object of its satire. His late Majesty condescended to mark his opinion of the justice of its
tensure by commanding its performance at the Theatre-Royal, Drury-Lane, twice in one season.

To conclude with (FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS THEATRE), the Drama of—THE

E X I LOR,ERUSSIAN
OF SIBERIA:
CLEMENCY.
*
This interesting Play is taken from Madame Cottiu's celebrated French work " Elizabeth, or the Exile of Siberia/' The story, sentiments, and most striking situations, are closely copied from the original, which has been universally read and admired throughout Europe,
and translated into almost every modern language. Were the narrative merely the creation of fancy, it would be considered as affecting a
fiction as ever met the public eye; but as it is generally known to be founded on truth, and to be actually an embellished fact, tenfold
sympathy is naturally excited by its dramatic representation. The Heroine of this piece was a character that really existed in our own
times, who undertook a dangerous and painful journey of several thousand miles, over trackless snows and inhospitable deserts, to throw
herself at the feet of her sovereign at his coronation, and implore pardon for an honourable, but exiled father. The Emperor Alexander,
whose magnanimity has since been the theme of every tongue, even then gave a happy and glorious presage of his character and reign, by
generously granting a parent's freedom to the ardent supplications of his duteous child, thus rewarding filial piety, and exerting the best
prerogative of royal clemency, the power of pardon. This transaction, so honourable to a living monarch, from motives of stage effect and
propriety, is fixed at a remote period of history. Facts are improved by the most impressive fictions. The heroic character of Daran, the
unwearied champion and protector of oppressed innocence, heightens the serious interest of the piece, while the pathetic is admirably
blended with the comic, and the most animated and choicest music sheds brilliance and hilarity over the whole of this varied and enter*
taining Drama.

The Incidents comprised in this Drama are drawn from Facts which occurred in and near Genera, where an Orphan, named THERESE, was, from

but by the artful advice of her treacherous advocate, Carwin, fled the punishment that awaited her. She was received by the Countess Morville, and about to be allied to
hi r son. w.en her persecutor discovers, and compels her again to fly. Taking refuge in the night at the Farm kept by Lavigne, (where the Countess also happens to be a

T H I S affectin? Tragedy {the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising .feneration), was founded upon fa.t. T h e unfortunate bero
«f the piece was executed for the murder of h i , virtuous and venerable Uncle, in the reign ol Queen Elicabetb j t o which he was instigated by an artful,
cruel, ami abandoned Woman : step by step she led l b . unwary Youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence, by the most ignominious 4" ath,
A story i . reported, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a young Gentleman of the City of L . n d o u , having e m b e u l r d part of h i .
Master'- propeity, wa« providentially at the repre.entati.in of " (.KUBf'.r. BAKNWEI.L," at Drury Lane, when t h e admirable actor, Mr. Mo»s, personated
George Barnwell, at whose fate he v»a« so ( t r u c k , that it occasioned his immediate contrition arid refoimati.n. The Gentleman so benefited by this excellent
Tragedy was not ashamed to own his obligation to the Play and PerKniner, for, at every subsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Most received a hundred pound,
sterling, with a card t o the following effect:
" Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation ol Gr..R8E BAR-SWELI., for more than life !^-for his redeemed honour and credit!—beg.
" your acceptance of the enclosed, which t u n you will receive year'y, as long as you continue i . your profesvion.
Happy am I to acknowledge that
" the Stage has prevented me fi on, ruin am! do-grace. < George Barnwell' (tupped me in my mad career, and saved me trom an ignominious death.
" I am, &c. ——— — — A celebrated and learned Divine observes, that " Fathers and heads of families, whose duty it is to watch over and guide the morals of the rising ge" aeration, would do well to permit y o u n j people, under their direction, to be present at the .""erlormanoe of ibis escellent Tragedy, m which instruction

and

ON FRIDAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 3 , 1832,
Will be performed, the only time this season, the popular Tragedy of

W A M F fit MY A n M?
The incidents on which thisTragedy is founded are perfectly historical. The Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard the Third, to answer his
ambitious purposes, accuses Jane Shore of Witchcraft. Every proof of her guilt in that instance having failed, she was next charged with other
crimes which it was in vain for her to deny, and by sentence of the ecclesiastical court, she was made to perform penance in St. Paul's Church,
and then to walk barefoot through the streets of London; aad, as tradition reports, perished with hunger. Rowe has produced from the incidents of her singular life this favourite Play ; and the wife of a goldsmith of Lombard-street has drawn tears from the rich and poor for three
hundred years past, aad will never cease having power over the heart* of a British Audience, while the arrows of the unfortunate Jane Shore
can be remembered.

OR, T H E ITALIAN ROBIN HOOD.
PROGRAMME —AWessandm Massaroni, the Italian Robin Hood, was one of those dating spirits that seem to have been Created to correct the unequal distributions of
good and evil. Chief of a lawless band, infesting the Mountain. near Home, his name spread terror throughout Italy; no place was secure Irom bis Emissaries • and so skilful
were his art. of disguise, that he wa< often m.idc the confidant ol I'lot, laid bv his enemies to i ntrap him. He was a strict dispenser of moral justice: if he made free with
the Rich, he was the Almoser ol the Poor; and never did he resort to violence but when a tempting bo«ty and stout resistance s'ood in his way. Like the famous freebooter
of merry England, he mingled mirib with hi, maletactions, and those who paid the dearest for his pranks, were often the first to lau^h at hi. humour.

THIS affecting Tragedy (the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising; generation), was founded .poo fa.t. The unfortunate hero
nf the piece was executed for the murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, in the reign of tjueen Elizabeth ; to which he was instigated by an artful,
rruel, and abandoned Woman: step by step she led the unwary Vouth to the last cruel d*ed, which terminated a miserable existence, by the most ignominious death.
A story is reported, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a young Gentleman of the City of London, having embezzled part of hi.
Master's property, was providentially at the representation of " GEOBOE BARNWELL," at Drury Lane, when the admirable actor, Mr. Moss, personated
George Barnwell, at whose fate he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contritira and reformation. The Gentleman so benefited by this excellent
Tragedy was not ashamed to own his obligation to the Play and Performer, for, at every subsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Mosi received a hundred pound.
sterling, with a card to the following effect:
" Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of G E» HOE BA RNWELL, for more than life!—for his redeemed honour and credit!—beg.
" your acceptance of the enclosed, which sum you will receive yearly, as long as you continue i . your profession. Happy am J to acknowledge that
" the Stage has prevented me from ruin and disgrace. ' George Barnwell' stopped me in my mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death.

ON MONDAY EVENING, A P R I L 30, 1832,.
Will be performed, the TR AG B D Y of

JANE SHORE.
The incidents on which this Tragedy is founded are perfectly historical. The Duke of Gloucester, aftei wards Richard the Third, to answer his
ambitious purposes, accuses Jane Shore of Witchcraft. Every proof of her guilt in that instance having failed, the was next charged with other
crimes which it was in vain for her to deny, and by sentence of the ecclesiastical court, she wat made to perform penance in St. Pa.il'i Church,
and then to walk barefoot through the streets of London ; aod, as tradition reports, perished with hunger. Rowe ha* produced from the incidents of her singular HA| this favourite Hay ; and the wife of a goldsmith of i-ombard-tlreet hat drawn tear, from the rich and poor for three
hundred years past, and will never cease having power over the hearts of a British Audience, while the wrrows of the unfortunate Jatie Shor-i
can be remembered.

On FRIDAY EVENING, MARCH 2 9 , 1 8 3 3 ,
Will be presented, the Comedy ef—THE

AHD HS I.H \ r ^M'.Hwra ra sail
T/tis Comedy ivas twice commanded by his Majesty in one Week, and the part of Dr. CANTWELL acted by
Mr. DOWTON, 38 Nights in one Season.
The HYPOCRITE, says Dr. Valpy. in a letter to a Rev. Divine, is a Play thai should be performed in every Theatre in his Majesty's
dominions ; it inculcates sound doctrine and is truly orthodox ; it expeses that class of pretenders (of which, I am afraid, there are very many',,
who, under the veil of sanctity, get footing in many good and worthy families, where these wolfe«, in sheeps' clothing, batten on their substance, take advantage of their credulity, destroy their purse, and, at last, render them uncharitable, fanatic, unsociable, and miserable.
Therefore, this play, to use the Author's own words," is written to guard us against hypocrisy, to enable us to distinguish between piety and
pretention—for what can be more detestable than pretenders to religion, or what more beautiful or more lovely than the fervour of a sincer.
piety"—to the Hypocrite, and him only, therefore, is the satire of this Play applied.

OR, THE LONDON MERCHANT.

*

THIS affecting Tragedy (the moral tendency of which ha» been so beneficial to the rising generation), was founded upon fact. The unfortunate hero
of the piece was executed for the murder of hi-, 'virtuous and venerable Uncle, in the reign of 0,ueen Elizabeth; to which he wa* instigated by an artful,
rtrael, and abandoned Woman : step by step she led t h . unwary Youth to the last m i e l deed, which terminated a miserable existence, by the most ignominious J»ath.
A story is reported, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a voting Gentleman of the City of Landon, having embezzled part of his
Master'" property, was providentially at the representation of " GBUftAK RAKNYVF.1.1," at Diury Lane, when the admirable actor, Mr. Moss, pee .mated
George Barnwell, at whose fate he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman so benefited by this excellent
Tragedy was not ashamed to own his obligation to the Play and l'erlormer, for, at every subsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Moss received a hundred pounds
Herling, with a card to the following effect I
" Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of GloROB BAKNWEU , for more than life !—for his redeemed honour antl credit!—begs
" your acceptance of the enclosed, which sum you will receive year'y, as long a« you continue in your profession.
Happy am 1 M acknowledge that
" the Stage has prevented me from min and di-grace. ' George Barnwell' stopped me in mv mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death" 1 am, &e. — - . —
"
A celebrated and learned Divine observes, that '* Fathers and heads of families, whose duty it is to watch over and guide the morals of the rising ge"neration, would do well to permit young people, under their direction, to be present at the Performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which inatrucltttu

T H E A T R E , SALISBURY.
ON MONDAY EVENING, DEC. 9,1833,
Will be performed, the T R A G E D Y of

JANE SHORE.
The incidents on which thisTragedy is founded are perfectly historical. The Duke of Gloucester, afterwards Richard the 1 bird, to answer his
ambitious purposes, accuses Jane Shore of Witchcraft. Every proof of her guilt in that instance having failed, she was next charged with other
crimes which it was in vain for her to deny, and by sentence of the ecclesiastical court, she was made to perform penance in St. Caul's Church,
and then to walk barefoot through the streets .f i.ondon; and, as tradition reports, perished with hunger. Rowe has produced from the incidents of her singular life this favourite Play ; and the wife of a geld smith of Lombard-street has drawn tears from the rich and poor for three
hundred years p.st, and will never cease having power over the hearts of a British Audience, while the sorrows of the unfortunate Jane Shore
can be remembered.

Or, Lady of the Isles.

This Piece is taken from a Story lately published, and supposed to be the production of Lord Byron, founded on a belief prevalent in most of the Oriental Countries of the existence of Vampires, whose lives are restored by being placed, at the moment of
dissolution, In the beams of the Moon, and whose annihilation is suspended by marrying a young and spotless female before the
expiration of each year, and before the Moon sets on the Evening when the year expires, and whose lives are devot*l in the
most savage manner to glut the Vampire, and save him from destruction.

TO

George Atkinson
ONE OF THE

MAGISTRATES,
OF THE

CITY OF NEW

SARUM.

SIR,
As one of your fellow Citizens, Nvhom you address, I do perfectly recollect
that at the Sessions of October, 1*33, you* endeavoured, with more zeal than
either Prudence or Charity would dictate, to prevent the renewal of the Licence
for the Theatre in this City, I was present at the time ; I heard and paid attention to what you, no doubt, thought very argumentative reasons on your part, and
I observed, with feelings of pity, the sorry figure you cut on that occasion,*--how
you shifted from one argument to another, when you were so ably refuted by our
noble Recor
•«#i.^.. iM„„ietrntt>a tin the Bench, one of
whom
would cnaiiengc
wouia
challenge agaiusi
ag
y uu c*n\* j " « . .„
same Gentleman assured you and his Lordship, that he was a frequent visitor to
the Theatre ; that he considered it a sound, rational, and moral amusement; and
that he never heard or witnessed any thing improper or immoral there in his life.
The then late Mayor, and other Magistrates, asserted the same.
And yet you
say in your address to us, "notwithstanding my remonstrances the Licence was
granted" Why ! to be sure it was. Were not the assertions of your Brother
Magistrates of much greater weight and importance than the flimsy accusations
and hearsay evidence, which you brought forward, and as I have before stated,
the sorry figure you cut on that occasion would, (I was in hope,) have taught you
the lesson, that it is more easy to make charges than to substantiate them.
But Mr. Atkinson, if those things are really as you say they are, what an imputa-.
tion are you casting on the C L E R G Y of your own C H U R C H . I beg pardon,
1 mean, the Clergy professing the sound orthodQx principles of the C H U R C H
of E N G L A N D . ) For why is it that they do Aqt interfere to prevent thisfilthiness, this obscenity, and this impiety, as you are pleased in your Charitable remarksfto call it] The fact is, that they they are not tainted wiih that most detestable of all Vices spiritual and Pharisaical pride, and will you. Sir, one of the
Laity take upon yourself to issue out your spiritual mandate, and dictate to heads
of families, many of whom are far more exalted in education, birth, and station of
life than yourself.
Are you, 1 say, the Jit and proper person, to dictate to them, and boldly assert, that the Theatre presents a picture
,.of filthiness, obscenity, and impiety, when they themselves, possessing as much sound morality and true religion, as you
con lay claim to, are patrons and patronesses of that amusement.
For shame! for shame! What an imputation do you. at once, cast upon their characters. And you *-all npon the
MAGISTRATES to shut up the only place of rational amusement we have, and that only about three or four months in
the year, to pl|aae your capricious, mistaken notions of morality. Oh'*! my heart sickens at such mockery !
Would twit your time, Sir, be much more profitably employed in endeavouring to put down those infernal den$ of
iniquity the Rum and Gin Palaces which are the destroyers of both Body and Soul.
But whilst I subscribe myself a lover of Truth, and Justice, and an admirer of rational amusement, 1 do also,
in the fullest extent of the word, subscribe myself an enemy to,

CANT AND HYPOCRISY.
Salisbury, March 26, 1835.
GlLMOliR, PRINTER. SARUM

TO GEO. ATKINSON, E S a . .
ONE OF T H E MAGISTRATES
OF THE

(TJITH OIF ^ A L I ^ I B W I B Y a
SIR,
The zeal which you always display on questions relating to religion or
public morals is well known to every one; whether, however, that zeal be
what St. Paul designates as " contrary to knowledge" is a point whereon we
essentially differ.
You have been pleased, in the plenitude of your anxiety for the spiritual welfare of your fellow citizens, to
circulate a printed attack against the only place of public amusement in this city, where the P O O R as well as the
rich can be entertained ; and you have been led to do this chiefly, as I collect, because a play has been performed
there which holds up cant and hypocrisy to scorn and contempt, and exhibits in a true light the acts of those who
go about " making merchandize of the souls of men."

There are many, Sir, with minds as well regulated as your

own, who witnessed the performance without feelings of "disgust" or "shame ; " and I, too, have been informed
by a gentleman who was present, that the general tenor of the play is such asT have described it, and that
it abounds with wholesome truths peculiarly galling to those " who fast twice a week and give alms of all
they possess, and thank God that they are not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even"
as these poor players.
But granting for a moment, that the play of "The Hypocrite" is that compound of ufilthiness, obscenity,
and impiety," which you would have us believe; still it furnishes no argument against theatrical representations generally, otherwise the abuse of WINES and SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS would be an argument
against their moderate use; a proposition to which, I am sure, you will not subscribe.
I thank you for reverting to the part which you took in opposing the grant of the License to the Proprietors
of the Theatre, in October 1833, because it reminds me that the whole of your brother Magistrates, men as vigilant over the public morals as yourself, as talented, and with minds as religious and pure as our own, unhesitatingly yielded to the application ; and informed you that if public decency were outraged at the Theatre,
you would have your remedy against the proprietors, by preferring a Bill of Indictment against them at the
Sessions.

This is the course you ought to pursue in the present instance, instead of doling out to the public

the hearsay statement of a gentleman, whose sense of delicacy was so acute that, notwithstanding his disgust
at " t h e wanton oaths" and "licentious conduct," he nevertheless witnessed-the performance THROUGHOUT.
The Clergy, no doubt, appreciate your kind advice, but if I were a member of that respectable body, I
could not forbear gently whispering in your car,

« N E SUTOR ULTRA

CREPIDAM."

I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant,

SALISBURY HERALD PRESS)—J. HEARN, T v n

Cant! Caul!! Cant!!!
and so, Mr. G E O R G E ATKINSON, your brother MAGISTRATES granted a LICENCE
for the PLAY-HOUSE, in spite of your conscientious opposition. How cruel! This proves that they
differed from you—that was cruel, too. Poor, ill-used Gentleman, you were left in a solitary minority
of one : how distressing to a man of your religious turn of mind!—and, worse than all, they (the Players)
acted that filthy and abominable Play, " T H E HYPOCRITE :"— ay, that was cruel indeed !
I do assure you, Mr. G. ATKINSON, that no man has more opportunities than the writer of this of
witnessing what a terrible knock-down-blow that Play is to certain sects of RANTERS and C A N T E R S ,
which you and I know something about. But, my valuable and religious Friend, and Dernier in Liquid
Fire, where is the filthiness, obscenity, and impiety you mention ? I fear it is in your own cloudy and
bigoted imagination only. Your informant, who saw the Play acted, had just returned from a
Love-feast, full of naughty ideas, or had taken too large a dose of your genuine unadulterated Mountaindew, alias Hodges's Particular, I am afraid.* You know, my very valuable and liberal Friend, and,
if you don't, I do, that there are men, and not a few, as the Players say in " T H E H Y P O C R I T E , " lfc who
make a Trade of Religion, and show an uncommon concern for the next world, only to raise their fortunes
with greater security in this :"* not that I mean to insinuate that you know, or that I know, any of your
religious Friends who would do so. Oh no, by no means ; we are all pure and immaculate, But I once
knew a person who kept a Shop in a Country Town, who, they told me, was not a RANTER,—that is,
my dear Friend, one who sends every Soul to the Devil who does not think and act as he does;—but why
do I tell you, who know as well as I, what a Ranter is ?—" Well, what's his profession of faith ?" said I.
" Why, he CALLS himself a PROTESTANT C H U R C H M A N , " was the reply. The W E E P E R S and GROANFIRS, who think *it a crime to laugh, and sinful to be happy, are very good CUSTOMERS of HIS, angl are
numerous in this Town : therefore he abuses every thing they abuse, and pretends to Religion, of
which he has none in his Heart. By which means he secures THEIR Custom, and makes m good thing of
them. This man is a great distributor of Bibles, too : but I am odd in my notions, Mr. G. ATKINSON,
and think it strange to visit the Poor with a B I B L E in one Hand, and a GIN-BOTTLE in the other. But to
the Players:—Our end is answered ; the satire of -' T H E HYPOCRITE
has had its effect; 'and if the cap
fits Mr. G. ATKINSON, they give htm leave to wear it. At least, I do. Your appeal to the Magistrates,—
and you should have known better, as one of that body,—and to the Clergy, to save the Souls of their
Flocks, is superfluous. You should have known that his Majesty's Lord Chamberlain has cognizance
and copy of every Dramatic Piece sent to him, and that he, by virtue of his Licence, erases every Phrase
or Word considered immoral, licentious, or irreligious ; and that the Proprietors of the Patent Theatres
dare not suffer one Word, so erased, to be retained, on forfeiture of their Patent. Therefore, it is his
Majesty's Lord Chamberlain, and his Majesty's Licenccr of the Drama, whom you libel, for which you
are liable to a Prosecution by the Attorney-General: but fear not; your Assertions are two FANATICAL
and ridiculous to be noticed bv any sensible Man.' Do you know, Mr. G. ATKINSON, that, a few years
WELL,

A

B

'

ago, there live(Pone of the best, the most moral, and religious men this Country ever saw, and who
condescended to tell even humble me, Mr. G. ATKINSON, that Plays were his favourite Amusement; and
thAt personage was the kind, the good, and pious GEORGE the T H I R D , who patronised Plays and Players
lorough the whole of his long life : and I have seen him and his good and vi&uous Consort and Daughters
laugh at and applaud " T H E HYPOCRITE " again and again. Will any one believe that GEORGE the
T H I R D would have witnessed an exhibition of filthiness, obscenity, and impiety f ' None but one of your
heated imagination; but you have no malice, I am sure : I T ' S ALL IN THE WAY OF T R A D E , Mr, G.
ATKINSON. The PLAY-HOUSE hurts the GIN-SHOP, eh ? That you consider Rum .-—pardon the
Joke,—I'm afraid it's sinful. Say what you will, Mr. G. ATKINSON, the wisest Men, in all Countries,
and in all Ages, have proclaimed the Stage as a. School of Morality,—and satire is its duty.
The Person who now conducts the SALISBURY THEATRE has the Character of being an honest
Man, a good Husband, a|id an affectionate Father, with a numerous Family :—is it fair to endeavour to
injure him ?—is it charitable?—Is it liberal?—is it like the great Founder of our Religion, whose Name
you profane in your CANTING, LUDICROUS HANDBILL. I reply, in your own words, " Shame, .Shame, on
such Anti-Christian Sentiments !"
Yours, with due Lamentation,

W. DOWTO*.-.

P. S.—I will take another opportunity soon of playing D R . CANTWELL in SALISBURY, notwith- j
standing your '* filthiness, and foolish talking, and jesting, which are not convenient."* Then the Public *
can judge of your perverted judgment, and see the falsehood of your pitiful Handbill,*—" Oh for an
ounce of Civet, good Apothecary, to sweeten this Man's Imagination!"—SHAKSPEARE? j L . .

begs leave most respectfully to inform the Nobility, Gentry, and Inhabitants generally, of
Salisbury and its Vicinity, that in consequence of the publication of a Handbill, denouncing the Play of
the HYPOCRITE as full of FILTHINESS, OBSCENITY, and IMPIETY, with WANTON OA#HS, LICENTIOUS coSntcT,
IMPURE SENTIMENTS, and OBSCENE I.ANGUAGR, which is R false and scandalous statement, he has been induced,
at the request of several respectable parties, who witnessed its first representation, to annourice it for Monday
Evening next, on which occasion Mr. DOWTON will remain to perform the character of I ) R . CANTWELL, m
order to afford the Public an opportunity of judging for themselves, without receiving at. ek-parte opinion of
its merits from those who have NEVER SEEN OR READ I T , or like the Gentleman who wRs so disgusted with it
that he remained to witness its termination.
The Play was written so expressly to answer one good end, and is so free from filthiness, obscenity, and
impiety, that there is not a single oath to be found in it. The general tenour of the Play abound! with such
sentiments as the following :—
** Let us be careful to distinguish between VIRTUE and the APPEARANCE of it. Guard, ff.jpiswiblc, ngam.it
doing honour to HYPOCRISY. But, at the same time, let us allow th^t there is no eliaractev in iffe GRRATBR or
more VALUABLE than that of the TRULY DEvouT, nor any thing mote NOBLE or more RLAUTtrUL Anil m e

cverv form is a fair mark for the dramatic satirist, and the drama does a real service to society when it holds up to scorn and contempt the jtibW in righteousness, the pious pilferer, or, i» one word,
the hypocrite. We live in im we of religious speculation 5 and it depends upon the present generation whether oar children shall be, as ottr fathers were, cheerful and rational Christians, or gloomy

SLAP-UP-LIFE.—Corinthian House, Chqfling~Crib.--k man's father born before him—
Rainbows and Slaveys; N A T U R E will peep at times—all made of the same flesh and blood, only
togged differently.
First impressions of London on the topper of a Yokel—Pictures dangerous;
4hen beware of originals. Training for an ouT-and-ouTER, or how to queer the Ogles: yet
necessary to look like an Upper Customer of Society, if nothing else. Introduction of a ChaffCutler: J E R R Y not awake: more brains wanting—and quite at a stand-still for the want of a
New Book on Patter.—The Synonomy of Flash developed. Taking measure of a man's pocket
more than his back—a prime artist—and how to cut a figure. Jerry dressed for the pftrt—
Music over, the Prompter's call obeyed—Curtain up—and a toddle on the Grand Theatre of
the World-—a peep, en passant, at the S H O W - S H O P .

L I F E I N T H E SHOW-SHOP.
Buckingham House, St. James's Park.—-Not keeping time—the Ladies on the Fret. Pit-a-Pat,
or, " My heart with love is beating." Have you got the Licence? No , I've been to Tattersall's.
It's too bad : I'll not put up with it-— A kind look or a tender word does wonders—the art of

At Almack's Assembly-Room.—A touch at the S U P E R B : the advantages of Birth—born with
silver spoons in the m o u t h — S P L E N D O U R till you are tired of it. C O R I N T H I A N S but.no Commoners : all lop-of-the-tree folks—POLITENESS to the very etho ; and R E F I N E M E N T to the end
of the chapter. B R I L L I A N T S covered with diamonds: and the F A I R O N E mgood mgold: and
no double shuffle, or false steps. A thorough-bred scene—HIGH L I F E in perfection—and
CLIMAX of S O C I E T Y in the Metropolis.

DYOT-STREET, I N T H E HOLY LAND.
FLAT-CATCHING
! Who bites ? A fine picture, but no painting. « A L L A L I V E , O!"
Effective enough to have put a M H I I A E L A N G B L O in a reverie ; and for a Rubens to have
been lost with surprise: a dark subject—Hypocrisy and Deceit filling up the back-ground.
Ease before manners—no Starch wanted—SOAP out of the question—nothing to do with the
Ne«? River Company—and Togs only necessary to answer purposes. To live and be jolly the
object in view. Tickets not necessary—any port in a storm—never a Jack without a Jill—all
happiness : no questions asked : and one half the world don't know how the other half lives. No
matter! Plenty of Taste; patter without ceremony ; and not particular to a shade about lingo.
Sporting a Toe without a Shoe, and no inquiry after the Snob's bill—reeling without steps;
flooring instead of waltzina ; and nothing the matter. Country or Colour no objection.

L I F E I N A SCOUT KEN,
I N T E R I O R O F A WATCH-HOUSE.—Consequence, gemmen must be heard first—
here's my card—I'm an M. P., an LI. II. S., and a G. S. The Gammon won't do—Old
Snoozy awake, and the Charley perfect in his part, with his stage property to give it effect—
Won't stand being booked for the night—show fight, and bolt.

CHAFFING C R I B .

The .fewe Piece is not entitled to the appellation of T R A G E D Y , C O M E D Y , Opera, P L A Y . Farce. B A I . I . E T , or Meh-Drama, yet partaking of the
Qualities of all, and possessing Scene, H I O H and L O W in abundance, from the "8kg Parlour" to the " D I A M O N D VaulL" OUT-and-OUT HAMBI.KS
and S P R E E S , East and West—and lots of Character, UP and DOWN. A variety of SweHt, but no D O N ' S : C O R I X T H I A N S Hnd CosTAiin-.MoVGKns
of many hurt and colourt; F L A T * and S H A R P S , without a Note—PISKS
and T U L I P S , but no F L O W E R S , vet always in the Hot-Unimex: M U S L I N S

developed by a precious T R I O , in the person of a Top-of-the.Tree H E R O , U P and dreacd in all s u r r a : seconded bv a slap-ham: Countryman, that
neither hedge no* ditch baulks his pursuits s hnd in unison with a prime piece of LOGIC, without P R E M I S E S , yet always so much at HOM K, that L O C K E

T H E P A R T OF

B O B LOGIC9

Darkey over.-—Jerry's symptoms of uneasiness—cracked heads—debilitated—out of wind—
can't come to time; and the constitution fast on the decline; Logic lumbered, and Tom done up
—portraying that L I F E IN LONDON, without the check-string, is a rapid trot towards
Death! Jerry sees his folly—acknowledges his error—Hawthorn Hill in perspective. Jerry
united to Mary Rosebud—Tom and Corinthian Kate made happy.
In the course of the Piece, the following Choruses, Duetts, Songs, &c.:—

" T O FAM'D HAWTHORN HALL W E GOOD FELLOWS INVITE."
D U E T T . — " NOW, T H E ROSY MORN APPEARING."

Bold as Brass, yet timid and bashful—Curiosity uppermost, and 1 will have a peep if I die for
it. The Countryman and Londoner, a set off; but the advantage of elegance and the impression of gentlemanly conduct personified.—An interview removes many fears and prejudices,—
Sporting Subjects, but no fun : yet exercise the best medicine.—Chorus, " To fam'd Hawthorn
Hall, we good fellows invite."—Duet, " Now the Rosy Morn appearing."—Adieu to the

The "Tale of Mystery" is universally allowed to be the most interesting Melo-draroa produced on the British Stage,
both as to situation and effect. The outlines of the story are briefly that Count Romaldi barbarously attempts the life of
his Brother, Francisco Bianchi, to gain possession of his estates. The assassins hired for that purpose meet Francisco on
the Mountains, and deprive him of the power of speech,

By Inhumanly Cutting Out his Tongue! 1!
In this situation he is relieved by a domestic of Count Bonamo, to whose house he is conveyed. In the m«an time Count
Romaldi projects an union between his son and the niece of Bonamo, and arrives at the residence of the latter for that
purpose. To his astonishment, he meets his Brother, whom he supposes dead. He again attempts his life, but Francisco is
miraculously P R E S E R V E D BY T H E H E R O I S M O F S E L l N A , the Niece of Bonamo. Suspicion being excited,
Romaldi is obliged to fly. Information is given to the Officers of Justice, by Montano, a neighbouring gentleman. Coast
Kotualdi flies, and, amidst the Rocks of Appenez, encounters his Brother on the very spot where he formerly attempted
the Murder! Struck witb remorse, he presents a pistol to Francisco, beseeching him to take his life ; bat his human.
Brother dashes the instrument of death away, aud, throwing himself iato Romaldi's arms, grants hin> his forgiveness.

Then, die Soldier,
The sixth age shifts
Fall of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard.
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel. Into the lean and slippered Pantaloon;
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side;
T H E W H I N I N G S C H O O L - B O Y . Seeking the bubble reputation
His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
Even at the cannon's mouth:
For
bis shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
And then the whining School-boy, with his satchel.
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
And whistles in his sound:
THE JUSTICE,
Unwillingly to school:
THE IMP ANT.
Atfirstthe Infant,
Mewling and puking in the nam's aims :

T H E LOVBX.
And then the Lover,
Sighing like furnace, to a woeful ballad
Made to ha mistress* eye-brow:

And then, the Justice,
In fair round belly, with good capon lin'd
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut.
Full of wise saw, and modern instances.
And so he play* his part:

SECOND

Last scene of all
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,

The Captain and Crew of the Floating Beacon were wretches, who, for their crimes, were doomed to pass in a post
of danger a perilous existence ; but, though shut out from society, their ruffianly dispositions remained. Mariette
had been captured by them, and Frederic was wrecked on the Beacon Rock. Alarmed, lest on his return he should
communicate the situation of .Mariette, they determined on his murder. Frederic is, however, preserved, and the
scene3 in the Prison, COMBATS, and instances of British Valour, form a most interesting performance.

Tliisadniired Piece commences with Don Juan's intrigues, whose character is such, that no tie can subdue its baseness.
HE BETRAYS HIS FRIEND
A ltd the daughter of the Commandant, Donna Anna. In the Act of running away with her, he is
SURPRISED
BY THE FATHER,
Whom he Murders—he endeavours to escape by Sea, but A V I O L E N T STORM COMES O N , the Ship
becomes a Wreck—Juan is east ashore—Scaramouch is aaved by getting on the back of

A LARGE DOLPHIN.
Juan, though the very elements combine against him for the enormity of his crimes, still persists. The pursuit of
Justice causes him to fly—meeting with a set of innocent rustics celebrating a Wedding (a Dance by the Characters),
he decoys the Bride during the i'esti.ity, and carries her off.
Act I I . opens niib a liciv of a Grand Equestrian Statue to the memory of Don Guzman. On the pedestal,
which changes to letters of blood, " Hv thee I fell—thy fate's decreed : Heaven will avenge the bloody deed." Juan,
not dismayed at this, invites the Statue to a Banquet, which it assents to—he is next discovered in a Tavern—noises
the most hideiUs are now hoard,
THE GHOST
ENTERS,
and seats himself at the table—Juan, with the greatest composure, asks him to drink, but it refuses—ho then, fearless
of danger, appoints to meet the Spectre where its remains are interred : at which an awful scene of expostulation
ensues ; but the Ghost, finding all entreaty to induce him to repent in vain, seizes and throws hint to the ground. The
scene changes to an
AWFUL VIEW OF PANDEMONIUM.
Furies now gather round him—and he is harried away

IN A SHOWER OF REAL

FIRE.

T H I S Drama is found*! on an incident in the life of an individual denominated the GOLDEN FARM ER, a notorious HIGHWAYMAN, who, under
the guise of a Corn-chandler, dwelling in Thames-street, whilst exhibiting his packets of barley and oats by day, made himself acquainted with the
contents of the Farmet,' pockets, which he despoiled by night. By these dishonest means, he acquired a considerable sum, purchased a farm, obtained
the title of THE GOLDEN FARMER, and endeavoured, by sincere repentance and a reformed lift, to make some atonement for his former misdeeds;
but avarice tempting him into his old course, he is taken, tried, and condemned to death.

BROKEN SWORD;
Or, The Orphan and the

Murderer.

This Drama is of French origin, and acquired such unparalleled celebrity in Paris, as to induce one of our most popular Dramatists,
Mr. Dimond, author of the " Foundling of the Forest," " Hunter of the Alps," &c, to alter and adapt it to the English Stage; a
task he has fulfilled in a masterly manner, by heightening and improving some incidents, and adding others of a superior and
striking nature. Its moral is excellent, proving to a demonstration, that PROVIDENCE always protects the orphan and the
innocent—that Murder, however long and artfully concealed, rarely escapes condign punishment; while the conscience of the
guilty man becomes his own accuser. The unforeseen but natural and simple incident of the Broken Sword makes the crime of the
villain manifest, and the awful ends of justice are satisfactorily obtained by the undoubted proof of who is the Murderer.

P e r s o n , a circumstance t o t a l l y u n p r e c e d e n t e d in a Provincial Town. The unanimous voice of Public Opinion and the Press have declared it perfect and it will be produced in Salisbury with its D r e s s e s , D e c o r a t i o n s , P r o p e r t i e s , T r i c k s , T r a n s f o r m a t i o n s , M u s i c ,
( ' l i o r u s s e s , A c A c . complete, and that nothing may be wanting to render it equally attractive, ih. following eminent Artists have been sent from the
Theatre Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne:—

Miss A. LONSDALE, late Columbine at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane.
Miss DALLY, late Columbine at the Theatre R s y a l , Ba.th.
Mr SHAW, late Harlequin at the Royal Amphitheatre, London.
Mr C. J. SMITH, late Harlequin at the Theatre R s y a l Covent Garden,
Mr SANDERSON, late Clown at the Royal Surrey Theatre, London.

Mr. DAVIS in making the above announcement assures his I'atons in Salisbury and its environs that in the production .f this Novelty he is not influenced by the
hope of Profit (the vast Expense attendant on its Removal, together with the Principals concerned in it. from so great a distance as Newcastle upon Tyne, would
render such a hope vain), but rather with a view to exemplify to those who have oa former occasions so liberally supported him, that, although circumstance* ~"
pel his absence, he is not unmindful of his duty in catering for their gratification and amusement.

ON FRIDAY EVENING, JANUARY 29,1847,
W i l l be presented a

His fears having been worked upou by Stratagem, become the more whimsical in their effects, and that
which might have been fatal in reality, is so managed in the construction of this Drama, that the whole prodoses a most ludicrous effect.

DHIIII H ELL-

The excellent moral conveyed in this Play, renders it an imperative duty !o those who watch
over the Education of Youth, to lake every opportunity of their w .tneysing its leprcsentation ;
4hc good effects ot which are too well known to be here related. One instance however, on
record, may be mentioned. A young man had been induced to embezzle the property oi his
employer, and no doubt would have continued to do so, till discovery had consigned him over
to the offended Laws; fortunately he went to see this Play. whi< h awakened su< h strong feelings ol remorse, that he hastened lo make restitution, and afterwards became an eminent Merchant. To prove his Gratitude for having thus been preserved (torn shame and ignominy, he
sent yearly, on the evening ot his benefit, a £10. note, to Mr Ross, who, in the character of
George Barnwell, had shown him the coscquence of his defection.
The humble hero of this Drama is led progressively through the enchantments of
LICENTIOUSNESS, to ROBBERY, and trom thence to MURDER, which leads lo his

EXECUTION,
Not as an EXPIATION, hut an EXAMPLE, on the

FATAL

TREE,

i f ^

This celebrated and most extraordinary Drama is founded on the well known tale of Lord Byron's, emh.dying one of the most wild and singular superstitions of the durker ages. TheVampires are supposed
to be evil spirits, permitted to roam about the earth in mortal shape, with supernatural powers of fascination, so ton-as they sacrifice yearly, before the setting of the last moon, in every year, a young female, whom they must previously marry, and whose blood is necessary to support existence. The
moon is supposed to possess strange influence over these terrific creatures. If slain by mortal bands
and their corpses ate so placed, as to catch the first glimpses of the moon when it rises, they become
re-animate, and again appear in tinman shape. The fatal charter however is utterly lost, if through any
delay the appointed moon sinks into the ocean before the Vampire has sacriiced his victimCHARACTERS IN T H E VISION.

THE

This most interesting ol all Melo Dramas, commences with the imprisonment of Agib, son of
7orilda and heir to tbe Throne of Mingrelia, in a lortr. ss on the banks ol the Caspian Sea where he is
detained by Timour, Khan of the Af«han Tartars. Zorilda. whose daring mind and martial exploits,
have raised her hi'jh in the CAtimation oilier Mintircliau subjects, anxious to liberate her darling son,
arrives at the Court of Timour as the Princess Gcogia, whom he, Timour had never seen, but whom be
intends to make his bride, not from motives ol afl'eciion, but a.s he hiiuscll says, to possess the diadems
of Georgia Min°rclia, Taftary. China and India, w hich he considers a step whereon to raise the towerinir column of his future greatness. Notwithstanding her assumed character Zorilda is at length discovered and confined. Oglou, whose life she had loimerly saved, proves her Inend, and brings her to
her son Arib whose long separation is lost in tears and embraces. The most interesting scene possible
takes place which, after many "hair breadth escapes" terminates with Agib's escape through the window ot the Alcove, from whence he is received by the Georgian Soldiers, with shouts ofjoyous acclamations. Timour enraged, threatens the Hie of Zorilda, unless Agib will again become his prisoner—
regardless of life, she entreats the Georgians to continue the storming ol the Fortress. Timour in con..eouenccis about lo put his threat into execution, when Oglou rushes forward and saves her from his
brutal fury,—Zorilda escapes.—Agib is liberated.—The Georgians conquer. Virtue Triumphs,—and
vice is punished.

SLEEP

UPON

IT.

The Incidents of thii Drama are on entirely a novel idea—The heroine, poising- between good and evil, the temptation, of a rich establishment and the humble lot of a mechanic's wife,—at length resolves to sleep ere she fives
her decision—and in her dreams every incident of her future life passes in review before her, in fact, she acta
every scene as in real life; and having chosen the seductive, but dishonorable side, is, after various vicissitudes,
reduced to suicide, and the Drama terminates with her awaking from this astonishing illusion—which elicits her
gratitude for her late deliverance from vice and infamy,—and decides her instantly to choose the more honorable
though humble lot of a VIRTUOUS PEASANT'S WIFE, TO THAT OF A SPLENDID MISTRESS.

A late celebrated Divine, OR. PLUMTREE, advises Fathers and the Heads of Families to allow their Children and
those under their Tuition to attend the Theatre to witness the performance of this most excellent Tragedy, in which
instruction is so strongly blended with amusement, that it cannot, offend the most fastidious. A fact has been related
and authenticated, that a celebrated Actor, Mr. ROSS, received a Letter enclosing a Bank Note of .£100. the
Writer staring that he had been saved from destruction ten years previously, through witnessing his personation of
GEORGE BARNWELL! that he forsook the path of vice, left his native Country, and had just returned a rich
man, and a worthy member of society ; and as a mark of gratitude to him who had wrought his reformation, be would
remit him the same amount annually.
Amongst this Tragedy's acknowledged beauties, it's Moral stands preeminent, either to warn the innocent, or to appal the guilty,

For the Benefit of JMr. & Mrs

l*ii--ci.---sii

The M A N A G E R in announcing his Benefit, and last Night of the Season, begs most respectfully to
express bis regret that the efforts he has made in securing the se vices of an efficient Dramatic Corns,
*nd the strict Attention he has paid in the selection and proper representation of the most popular
productions of the Dramatic Art, have not met with the approval and encouragement of a discerning
and enlightened public
From various causes, difficult to define, the Theatre has not receive<l the support necessary to enable
the Manager to obtain an adequate return tor the <rreat outlay undertakings of this kind necessarily
involve (the receipts having been v e r y l i t t l e m o r e than o n e - t h i r d of the expenses)—of this he
does not presume to complain, but with deference submits, that with the public rests entir ly the
question, whether he is to be enabled to extricate himself from his embarrassments, by the only mean,
possible, v i i . — T H E I R K I N D P A T R O N A G E .
For himself he begs to assure them, no labour shall be spared, or mean, left untried, to contribute to
their amusement ana intellectual gratification; and in return he asks, and trusts not unreasonably,
they will cheer him in his endeavour by securing to him their Attendance and Patronage.

The principal points on which the plot of the above Drama is constructed, are—that a party
of French Officers determine to pay their Mistresses a visit during Carnival, but being absent from
duty without leave, they are arrested and sent into temporary confinement at Fort Ravage ,
which is at that time guarded by three invalided veterans. The ladies in despair at this harsh
treatment of their lovers, resolve to assume the uniform of the renowned French Invincib.es, and
immediately to set out and endeavour to effect the liberation of the Officers; they .accordingly arrive In full

THE

T A BT AB,

This most interesting of ah Melo-dramas, commences with the imprisonment of
Agib, son of Zorilda, and heir to the throne of Mingrelia, in a Fortress on the banks of
the Caspian Sea ; where he is detained by Timour, Khan of the Tartars. 2J>rilda,
whose daring mind and martial exploits have raised her high in the estimation of her
Mingrelian Subjects, anxious to liberate her darling son, arrives at the Court of Timour
as the Princess of Georgia, whom he, Timour, had never seen, but whom he intends
lo make bis bride, not from motives of affection, but as he himsolf says, to possess the
diadems of Georgia, Mingrelia, Tartary, China, and India, which he considers as
steps wheredn to raise the towering column of his future greatness. Notwithstanding
her assumed character, Zorilda is at length discovered and confined. Oglou, whose
life she had formerly saved, proves her friend, and brings her to her son, Agib, whose
long separation is lost in tears and embraces. The most interesting scene possible
takes place, which after many "hair breadth escapes" terminates with Agib's escape
through the window of the Alcove, from whence he is received by the Georgian Soldiers, with shouts of joyous acclamation. Timour enraged, threatens the life of Zorilda
unless Agib will again become his prisoner-—regardless of life, she ititreats the Georgians to continue the storming of the Fortress. Timour, in consequence, is about to
put his threat into execution, when Oglou rushes forward, saves her from his bt-utal
fury, Zorilda escapes, Agib is liberated, the Georgians conquer, virtue triumphs, and
vice is punished.
