New Theatre Royal, Drurj-Laa^
St’CH parts of the design for the re-building the Interior of this Theatre, and which the shoitncss of the time prevented from being entirely completed last year, have been accomplished, by many additional Comforts, and superb Addenda to the Decorations.
The additional Comforts consist in the opening of several
Commodious Family Boxes,
fa the First Circle, similar to those which were so much patronized last year in the Dress Circle — Additional ACCOMMODATION in the Ui’i’ER Circle of Boxes.
A new second-price Waiting-Room to the Pit.
A more spacious and convenient Staircase has been adapted to the Uppbb Gallery, the Arch •bf which has bcea extended, so as to unite much better with the Ceiling, and at the same time to afford a much more extensive View of the Stage—Another commodious Seat lias been added to the Lower-Gallery. "With regard to the Decorations of the Avsi’osr, the Ceiling has been completed by the introduction of the Foliage Ornarru n's in the Panncls of the Centre and Cove. The Pilasters over the open Gold Columns of the Proscenium have received their Scroll Ornaments, and the Base of the Proscenium has been covered with one mass of Sanded Gold, and this has been carried completely round the House, so as to forma solid plinth <>i Gold to the whole of the Auditory.
Two new & highly finished DROP SCENES
Hare been painted - one, an Architectural Pm/sage. inclosed in a gold frame, is the joint production of Marinari and Stanfield, and the other a Landscape, partly a composition from the Aohopolis, in which is introduced the Parthenon, together with the Coliseum, the Arch of Adrian, and other celebrated Buildings of Antiquity, by Stanfiei d.
In the Mechanic Department, the Stage lias been rendered much more practicable—the timber rapports Lave been replaced with Cast Iron Columns, and the Float widened so as to admit the operation: of Mediums, that will communicate the different Tints -of the Seasons, and of the rising and setting Sua on the Scenery. The whole of the Auditory will be illuminated by
A new CENTRA L LUSTRE,
Upon an entirely novel Plan, and by
Tiro Rows of Christal Chandeliers
Of Wax Candles, which, as a Light, arc considered more adapted to the comfort and health, as well as cond sive to the better appearance of the Audience than the Gas. The compact form of the house, which was acknowledged last year to have united so much comfort with elegance, and a perfect and easy possibility of hearing, with a complete view of the Stage, temains unaltered.
THE SALOON
Has been fitted up in a style of-unequalled splendour.
The Superb Plates of Freneh (-lass
•of last year still Tcmain, but they are now enclosed by Pilasters and Columns, and surmounted by rick gilded and decorated Draperies, with two models finely executed of the Royal Arms.—The Draperies are painted by Roberts, assisted by Kelly, Hollogan and other artists, and the Marbling done I y Messrs. F. and H. Crace, by whom the whole of the magnificent decorations of the Theatre have been executed.

Tiic Arch of the U>ppf.u Gallery has been extended, so as to unite much better with the Ceiling, nod at the same time to afford a much more extensive View of the Stage, the entrance to which, is by n more spacious and conveni« nt Stainasc—Another comm dious Sc at has been added to the Lower •Gallery. With regard to the Decorations of the Atjdmory, the Ceiling has been -completed by the introduction of the Foliage Ornamcnis in the Pannels of the Centre and Cove. The Pilasters over the •open Gold Columns of the Proscenium, have received fheir Scroll Ornaments, and the Base of the Proscenium lias been covered with one mass of Sanded Gold, and this has been carried completely Tound the House, so as to form a solid row of Gold to the whole of the Auditory.
Two new & highly finished DROP SCENES
Have been painted—one, an Architectural Paysage, inclosed in a gold frame, is the joint production of Maris art and Stanfie.ji, and the ether a Landscape, partly a composition from the Acropolis, in ■which is introduced the Parthenon., together with the Coliseum, the Arch of Adrian, and other ede-biatcd Buddings ot Antiquity, by Stanfiei p.
In the Mechanic Department, the Stage has been rendered much more practicable—the timber supports have Ireen re placed with Cast Iron Columns, and the Float widened so as to admit the operation of Mediums. <ihat will communicate the different Tints of the Season, and ot the rising and setting Sun on the Scenery. Tbewhole-of the Auditory will be illuminated by
A new CENTRAL LUSTRE,
Upon an entirely new Plan of Johnston and Brookes, and Collins ; and
fTwo Rows of Christ al Chandeliers
frf Wax Candles, which, asa Light, are more adapted to the comfort a..d health, as well ascondcsive to the appear acre of the Audience than the Gas. The comjuu't form of the bouse, which was acknowledged last year to have united so much comfort with elegance, and a perfect and easy possibility of hearing, with a complete view of the Stage, remains unaltered.
THE SALOON
Has been ‘fitted up in a style of unequalled splendour.
Th« Superb Plates of French Glass
of last year Still remain, but they ate now enclosed by Pilasters and Columns, and surmounted by rich gilded and decorated Draperies, with two models finely executed of the Royal Arms.—The Draperies are painted by Roberts, assisted by Kelly, Hollogar and other artists, and the Marbling d&U8by Messrs. T. and M.Crace, by whom the whole oftbc magnificent decorations of the Theatre have been executed.

The Chest then being stored with varimi* phosphoric and destructive missiles, in case of an encounter, rapidly cleaves the air,> and alights on the Terrace of the Palace, which Malek and his attendant, Qstereo, enter on the departure of the Sultan and train.—Schirine, delighted at the sight of her lover, is about to escape with him when the alarm is sounded by JierGoven.ante, and the Sukan and his Fitter rush in, and bear off the Princess. Malek and Quereo anient he Chest, and mount the air, in pursuit of the ravishers, whom they overtake crossing a bridge.—Malek from the Chest pours down his missiles, which create such confusion, that the bridge breaks and precipitates the vanquished into the river—The triumphant Malek then alights, and is bearing away the Princess, when the Afrite Niger appears, and fires the Chest, but Lignum Vit«e rising from its centre, extinguishes the dames, and promises the lovers protection—Niger, causing the Chest to disappear, declares none but its possessor can gain the hand of the Princess; but Lignum Vilse informs them, though hindered by bis enemy’s spells from disclosing Use exact spot of •its concealment, he can considerably aid them in their search—He then transforms them into Harlequin and Columbine, whilst Niger changes Sultan and Vixier into Pantaloon and Clown. The usual pantomimical contest then commences, and continues till the Flying Chest being found, the
iieceterminates with theNuptials of Harlequin and Columbine in the Paha*)i«k of Zephyr and

After Forty-two Years of Theatrical Services, has the honor to announce to the Nobility, Gentry, her Friends and the Public in general, that in consequence of a long and severe Indisposition, which has rendered it impossible for her to attend to her Professional Duties, Mr. ELLISTON has, with his accustomed kindness, offered the Use of the House for her
Farewell Benefit,
On THURSDAY the 1st of JULY, 1824:
On which, to her, most interesting Occasion, she has every hope that all the Principal Performers disengaged, will unite with those of the Drury Lane Establishment, to furnish an Entertainment, worthy of the Patronage she seeks in the Decline of Life,'from that Public, who always received her humble Pretensions w ith Favor, and led her to believe that she might at all times look for their Protection.
As soon as arrangements can be made, several Places will be nominated where Tickets may be obtained, and a Committee appointed to conduct the interest ot this Benefit; in the mean time, Tickets and Places for the Boxes may be procured o*' Mrs. BLAND, 4t5, Gerrard ^Street, Soho ; and of Mr.

This long- distinguished \ Ocaiist, after Forty-two Years of Theatrical Service, is visited in her decline of life by that afHiction which, while it secludes the sufferer from all intercourse with the world, presents the strongest claim to its sympathy, and on the present occasion renders its best assistance peculiarly necessary, to soothe the distress of that calamity from which no,mind is ever secure. Mr. ELLlSTON has therefore, with his accustomed kindness, offered the use of the Hou.se for n
FAREWELL BENEFIT,
which will be conducted, m the inevitable absence of her whom it is intended tu serve, by a Committee of Friends; and it is humbly and respectfully hoped, that this appeal to a ¡renerous Public will be heard in behalf of AN OLD AND FAVORITE SERVANT. '*
