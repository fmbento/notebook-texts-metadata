The following is a sketch of the interesting incident on
which the Point of Honour is founded.
DURIMEL, a young Soldier of France, to avoid punishment for a trifling
offenee, deserts from bis regiment and conceals himself in the house of a widow
Lady, on the Germau frontier, whose daughter's affections he gains and is about
to be united to her when the regiment from which he deserted arrives in town ;
DURIMF.L is recognised, seized and condemned to death; during the investigation before the Court Martial, the CHEVALIER S T FRANC, (who, from a common
soldier, has risen, by i.is' '.ervices, to the rank of Major), discovers in the prisoner his long lost sou—the anguish of this discovery is increased by the cir.
cutnstance that it is the Major's duly to give the word of command for his son's
death. Theunhappv culprit is conducted to the place of execution,—his afflicted
father, as the only means of fulfilling the POINT OF HONOUR, by performing his own dutv and still preserving bis child, at the moment he gives the word
to fire throws himself between the pointed musquets and the object of his solicitude. This magnanimous &I..I.--C. obla.u. fu. DoniM.i. ... fr.o parAon, im<.
his union with BERTHA is consummated.

T H E .SPECTRE NUN, whom he discovers to be the Mother of Agnes, to whose Spirit he swears from
that moment to protect her Offspring. He afterwards fulfils his oath by rescuing her from the. Cave ot

the Cottage when the Count enters. Grindoff and Riber (one of the Bnnditti) attempt
to murder him when sleeping, but are prevented by Kari. Grindoff make* the Count
believe that Kel nar is a Bandit, by which means he escapes & carries with him Clandine

much infested with Banditti—Grindoff, the Miller, formerly dependant upon Count
Friberg, has a desperate gang of Robbers under his command, in the disguise of Millers,
which are the terror of the surrounding country ; Count Friberg and his servant, Karl
seek refuge in the Cottage of Kelmar, whose daughter is beloved by Grintloff. who is in
the Cottage when the Count enters. Grindoff and Riber (one of the Bandilti) attempt
to murder him when sleeping, but are prevented by Karl. Grindoff makes the Coun;
believe that Kelmar is a Bandit, by which means he escapes & carries with him Ciar.diae
(Kelmar's Daughter) by a secret pass to the Cavern under the Mill, and gives her La
charge to Ravina, Grindoff's Wife. Lothair, suitor to Claudine has entered the Cavern in
disguise, contrives with Ravina to effect their escape, and blow up the Mill with all its
guilty inhabitants.

humane Justin, who, commiserating her misfortunes, offers her an Asylum
in his House, and she at length becomes so attached to him, that (although
the Count Corvenio offers her an Asylum in his Mansion) she prefers remaining
with Justin, whom she regards as her benefactor—Accident discovers her to the
Robber, Cirenza Antonio, who, under the disguise of a Dutch Merchant, arrives
at the Inn, intending to assassinate the Count Corvenio and his Begimtnt,
'nen on their march to exterminate the Banditti—Cirenza employs his Gang
to supply the Soldiery with Wine, in order that by drinking to excess, they may
fall an easy prey. Desperado, keeping watch with Marcos, the Ceniinel; contrives
to make him drunk, but a quarrel taking- place, the Centinel being heated with
Liquor, draws ; a furious Combat ensues, in whichDesperado is killed—Cirenzo
finding the body of his companion, becomes enraged at the miscarriage of his
lUan, then collecting his band, they set the Inn on fire, and a general attack cominences, the consequence of which is, that the Count and Julietta are borne off by
Cirenza, who taking them to his Cave, is about to sacrifice the Count to his vengeance, when he escapes with Julietta though the means of JVIaco, the waiter of
the Inn—Cirenza and his band pursue and overtake them, but by the timely arrival

Mr. & Mrs. M. CORRI, under the impression that they may be considered
rather premature in annoucing their BENEFIT and the conclusion of their Engagement at so early a period, hope that as it has been occasioned by unforseen circumstances thev thall not be undeserving the patronage of the Bristol Public; and they
trust from the approbation which has invariably been bestowed on the New Melo
Drame of Robert the Bruce in various Theatres, it will not fail to give satisfaction
on the present occasion.

After which, (1-t time in Bristol) a Grand Historical, Caledonian Melc-Drama, in 3 Aets, as perfnrraed

with the int'st iiiupnivoca. marks of approbation, oalled

Robert

the

Bruce;

Or, The B A T T L E of B A N N O C K B U R N ,
Written by the Author of thefavourite Melo- Drame of Wallace the Hen of Scotland.
The Piece is founded on facts contained in the History ol Scotland, and commences shortly after the capture
oft lie renowned Wallace, when Robert Bruce and John Baliol being both claimants to the Scottish Crown,
agreed to submit their claims to the arbitration of Edward the 1st King of England, who having decided iu
favour of John Baliol, and the well known patiiotism of Bruce having rendered him obnoxious to that party,
be find., it necessary to ensure his safely by making a speedy retreat from tbe English Co rt. and on his
arrival iu Scollaiid finding his Count.yn.ei. ready to support his claim to the Scottish Crown in preference
to BALIOL (who had lost their confidence by having done homage to Edward), determined to defend hi.
rights to the last extremity.
The Piece commences at thi* juncture and details the various escapes, misfortunes and valoroos achievements of Robert Bruce and his hardy followers, until the final liberation ofScutland is accomplished by the
derisive Victory at the BATTLK OP BANNOCKBURN. There in also an incident related of Walter Ros*
Bruce'. Standerd bearer, who having vowed nevtrto part with his Country's Ensign 'till the last convulsive
Struggle of Death should oblige him to relinquish it, Was round alter the Battle among the slain, with both
Arms broken, but s'ill retaining the remains of the Banner between his teeth, au incident whicb is iu some
measure the foundation of some verV interesting situations throughout the Piece.

This Piece is from the Pen of J . G. PococEE, Esq. and allowed to be the most
effective Melo-Drama on the English Stage. T h e Scene lies in Bohemia, a< German
provence much infested with Banditti—GrindotT, the Miller, formerly dependant
upon Count Friberg. has a desperate gang of Robbers under his command, in the
disguise of Millers, which are the terror of the surrounding Country; Count Friber»and his servant Karl, seek refuge in the Cottage of Kelmar, whose daughter is
beloved by Grindoff, who is in the Cottage when the Count enters. Grindoff and
Riber (one of the Banditti) attempt to murder him when sleeping, but are prevented
by Karl. Grindoff makes the Count believe that Kelmar is a Bandit, by which means
he escapes and carries with him Ciaudine (Kelmar's Daughter) by a secret pass to
the Cavern under the Mill, and gives her in charge to Ravina, Grindofifs Wife.
Lothair, suitor to Ciaudine, has enterered the Cavern in disguise, contrives with
Ravina to effect their escape, and blow up the Mill with all its guilty inhabitants.

Or, T H E S P E C T R E NUN.
Taken from the Popular Tale of RAYMOND AND AGNES.
Among the most interesting incidents with which this Piece abounds, is the arrival of the Traveller, at
the Cottage of Baptiste. who, in ieague with a desperate band, headed by his Sons, makes several attempt!
to accomplish the MURDER OF RAYMO.VD,
who is however, informed of his danger by Margueretla,
by means of a bloodstained Pillow, with which she furnishes his bed, and is by her prevented from swallowing a sleeping poison mixed in his drink, by Bapliste, whom he overcomes at the moment he in about Xo
perpetrate the murder of Agnes, and assisted "by Margueretta, ACCOMPLISHES
HIS DEATH.
Raymond and Margueretta escapes the Banditti, and arrive safe at the Castle of Linden berg At length,
Raymond, amongst a train of adventures in the pursuit of Agnes encounters I HE S P E C T R E NUN, whom
he discovers to be the Mother of Agnes, to whose spirit he swears from that moment to protect her Offspring.
He afterwards fulfils his oath bv rescuing her from the Cave of the Robbers, whom having succeeded in
overcoming, the SHADE of the MURDRRED AGNES being appeased, blesses t i e Union of her Child
with her deliveier ; which terminates the Drama,-—forming a striking and interesting' conclasi.n.
