JOHN ISAACS,
Of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden.
For many years Mr. ISAACS was enabl.d, by his professional exertions, to raaintaia
himself and his family in credit and respectability, as well as to minister to the comforts of aa
aged Parent;— a duty which, much to his honour, he never neglected, even when he was
himself oppressed by difficulties and embarrassments. Owing- however to an almost total
loss of sight, and protracted mental and bodily illness, he has been obliged to relinquish
t h . S t a g e ; and, with a Wife and three Children, he is now reduced to a state of extreme
distress.
Under these melancholy circumstances, a number of Professional and Non-Professional
Friends, who have witnessed and admired his unassuming virtues in private life, have formed
themselves into a COMMITTEE for the purpose of devising some mode by which his distress
•say b . alleviated ;—and it has been resolved, as the best means of affording relief, that

A PLAY,
, A.YD

OTHER

ENTERTAINMENTS,

should ba performed for his Benefit,

Atthe T H E A T R E ROYAL, HAY-MARKET,
On MONDAY,

the 18/A January 1830.

Mr. CHARLES KEMBLE has, with his accustomed kindness "of heart, given permissioa
tO such Members of the Covent Garden Company as may not be in requisition on the night of
the Benefit, to lend their assistance in support of so praiseworthy an undertaking,—and from
the kind sentiments which all of the professional Brethren of Mr. ISAACS have expressed
towards him, it is confidently expected that a Dramatic Treat frill be provided sufficient of
itself to deserve Public Patronage, even though the performance was unconnected with circumstances calculated to excite general pity and commiseration.
The following Gentlemen have already kindly consented to become Members of the Committee:
SIR GEORGE SMART, T. R. C. G.
Mr. ABBOTT, T. R. C. G.
Mr. BEAZELEY, Soho-square.
Mr. BLANCHARD, T. R. C. G.
