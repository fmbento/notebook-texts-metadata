The plot of this Piece is simply this :—Young Raymond comes back from the Colonies with a large
fortune, and he wants to try his Cousin, a young woman, poor, but honest, whom he loved before his
departure, but who is determined to marry no one but a Comedian. He introduces himself, at Hrst, as
an old landed proprietor, who is in search of a housekeeper. He next assumes the garb of one of her
uncles, a labourer, in Normandy; and, thirdly, he pretends to be an old aunt coining to live with her.
The young person refuses the offers of the old seducer. She gives her jewels to htr uncle, and protects
her old aunt from violence. This lover next sendsan inkstand as a present to his cousin, with a bell,
which would have the magic power, on its being rung, of bringing Raymond at her feet all the way from
the Colonies, if she could but resolve to marry him. However foolish this may appear, the bell is at last
rung, and Raymond rushes in, because, sure, enough, he had taken his lodging in a room next door to her.

brought on the stage in a most spirited and original manner. Vnplesms a painter lately married, has in
his house a young- lady cousin to his wife ; his Pupils are studying from a Stuffed figure dressed as a young
Bride. Anterior, the Romantic hero overlooks tile figure through a window, and feels lor it a violent
love. Ovplessis fancies that Anterior is In love with his wife. The young Cousin writes to Anterior, that
his sweet-heart is a Stuffed figure, and she places herself in lien of it on bearing thai the infuriated and
disappointed lover is coming to ascertain his misfortune. He believes her to be the Stuffed figure, and
levels his Pistol at her to smash her to atoms. She screams and starts up ! His astonishment cannot be
described on seeing this and hearing her talk and sing. The love, however, be had lor the figure is
transferred Hpon this young woman, whom he marries.

L i TlREMRE.—This Vaudeville is a perfect picture of a Taloe'ievx (a quarrelsome Parisian.) A
bookbinder named Georget is a gambler ; his young brother is a conscript, and the Parents, in order le
pat a man in his place, had for a long time economised all the money they could and placed it in a money
bo* (Tirelire.) Georgel, in one of his gamblit.g His, steals that sacred deposit and loses it! On his retorn, he finds the family heart-broken at the robbery, and at the man refusing to replace his brother
without the money '. Justin (the young brother) however, who was always suspected of being a gambler, proves to have followed up the safest game, and to have privately placed all his money in a savings
bank, wherefrom he brings home as much as Georget had lost! This unexpected event brings joy and
happiness back again, and a donble marriage takes place. Titi le Talacheiir, one of the heroes of this
Vaudeville, gives in tha utmost degree of witty animation, much enhanced hy a lew or the choicest songs
from the prettiest French operas.

T H E FRENCH COMPANY WILL PERFORM

MADLLE. MARGUERITE

MADEMOISELLE MARGUEBITB.—Bouginier, a Lawyer's Clerk, loves secretly Angelique Boissean, and follows her
about, blowing into an harmonica. He steals into her father's bouse, declares to her his violent passion, and says " he
will have her* happen what may" He soon comes in, under the disguise of Mademoiselle Marguerite, a female servant; and Mrs. Botsseau having an entertainment in her house, a most comical scene begins in the kitchen, where
Bouginier (who hnowt* a* he *aytt *• not a word about cooking"} puts bacon instead of sugar, cream instead of lard* and
throws a copious dose of "jallop" (physic) into the spinages, mistaking1 it for spice! Mr. Boisseau (an old rake) finds
Bouginier (Madlle. Marguerite) " a very fine woman" but is caught by his wife, and sent to dress himself. Angelique,
dressed as a young officer, now steps in, and having to play a part in the evening before the company, she thinks of a
capital plan to rehearse it upon the (supposed) kitchen maid, who soon, however, frightens her, by tailing at her feet
and blowing the harmonica! Qtfflard, a suitor of Angelique, by the mother's consent, mistakes her for a r«al officer,
and a rival of his; he writes to Mrs. Boisseau upon the subject, and hides himself in the bouse. At the same time,
Mrs. Boisseau receives a letter, informing her that Marguerite (of whom Bouginier had assumed the name) is an
immoral character; she (he) is dismissed immediately ; and, infuriated, breaks alt the crokery while going nut. He
toon, however, comes back again in his usual dress; he provokes Gifflard to fight a duel, tilling him Aiigeltque is Im
wife; he causes another suitor to be arrested for debt; and manoeuvres so ably, that he at last become* the happy
husband of Angelique: a denouement brought about through numerous and most comical incidents.

performed sixty successive nig-hts in London with acclamations of applause, called THE

AVENGER;
Or, THE LEAGUERS OF AUSTRIA.

The Plot of the Tragedy is founded chiefly upon Historical Facts, which occurred during the Thirty
Years' War. In the commencement of that sanguinary epoch, amongst the various excesses which were
committed by the triumphant armies of Austria, the Family Circle. Household, and Properly of WALDER fell a sacrifice. One night (the fearful ine'dents of which he relates with harrowing effect in the
last scene of his " eventful history") witnessed the total destruction, by the invading Troops, of bis
House, his Wife, his Children, and " all that was dear to him :" from which moment WALDER devotes
himself to vengeance.

GREAT

NOVELTY!!!

C3" F i r s t t i m e i n B a t h of the Celebrated American Traditionary Drama of the

I N D I A N GXRXT

The Indian Girl
Originally

performed

by

Mademoiselle CELESTE,

by her at the Theatre-Royal

Vrury

Lane,

London.

B3?" E x t r a c t f r o m t h e C o u r t J o u r n a l . — T h e Indian Girl was produced at Drury Lane on Saturday
night.—The beautiful acting of CF.LESTK, in every scene, was indeed a t r e a t ; but she surpassed herself, if possible,
in the scene with her father and sister, where they are endeavouring to recal the images of the past, and also w h e r e
she meets her husband going forth to execution.
R-S" T h e X a O n d o n A t l a s . — The Indian Girl proved to be exceedingly effective, in a great measure o w i n g its
success to the admirable acting of C K L K S T E , who not only threw herself into attitudes the most dramatic and e x pressive, but occasionally gave speech in a very engaging manner. Her performance was most intelligent and
fascinating throughout; and after the fall of the curtain, she was led forth by Mr. Cooper, to receive the congratulations and cheers of the house.
B 3 r L o n d o n T i m e s . — T h e Indian Girl has been extremely well received at Drury Lane, and afforded ample
scope to C E L E S T E for the display of much eloquent action. T h e gradual victory of memory over previous unconsciousness was beautifully natural. This was admirably pourtrayed by C E L E S T E , and richly deserved t h e g r e a t
applause with which it was honored.

On THURSDAY Evening, MARCH 8th, 1838,
Will be performed (first time out of Ivondon) tlie Celebrated American Indian Traditionary Drama, in Two Acts,—with
appropriate Scenery, Dresses, Decorations, Equipments, &c,-—entitled the

St. Marys Eves or, A Stf/ry of the Sotway, a piece containing- both
humorous and pathetic incidents well wrought and put upon the stage,
was produced at this house on Monday night. The principal character,
Madeline, wan performed hy Mademoiselle Celeste: indeed the whole interest of this drama depended upon her exertions. The character has
been written for her, and adapted to her peculiar talent of delineating'
Intense feeling with great care and felicity. The public are well acquainted with the merits of this lady in dumb show, a branch of the
histrionic art in which she is without a competitor. In the piece, last
night, she undertook, for the first time, a speaking part. It was. a
haaardons attempt, but it was crowned with success, and drew from every
part of the house the loudest applause and approbation. The tidy
speaks English well, but, as may be expected, with a somewhat foreign
accent To avoid any absurdity in her enunciation, the author very property contrived that the part she had to play should be that of a female,
a native of France, but domesticated and resident on this aide the Channel. This was an excellent piece of tact, and rendered her performance
from first to last—a treat.

(From the Literary Gassette.)
On Monday, and during the week, one of the domestic dramas, which
of late years have so distinguished this house, has been played with
entire and well merited success. Madeline was admirably supported by
Mile. Celeste—a pleasant voice speaking sweet broken English—her
acting is exceedingly touching, strong feeling faithfully pourtrayed,
striking and graceful attitudes, aid in making this part one of the most
attractive on the stage. Having 'bad her horse snot under her by a
ruffian, she swoons, and in the half delirium of recovery, seems still to
guide the horse, and, on knee and foot, half crosses the stage; the effect
is very fine. Also, in her flight, the loss of one shoe, tbe torn and disordered dress, are true to nature, and shews she has % head to conceive as
well as delineate the character. On the whole, this piece Is fairly
entitled to a long run, and to take its place amongst the pet pieces of
the Adefphi.

(From the Weekly Dispatch)
Yates is doing wonders at the Adelphi, with a new piece, called Saint
Mary'* Eve. Those who have never heard Celeste speak, will be astonished, when they find that her English, tinted rather than tainted by a
most ..greeable accent—is almost pure. She entered heart and soul into
the business of the scene, and won laurels both for herself and the author.

Celeste never appeared to more advantage than she does in this piece.

bestowed upon her exertions by the audience, has amply proved that she
well knows how to make use of it. The performance of the piece was
altogether excellent, and excited at its conclusion the calls of the house

the heart-felt applause of the spectators.

PROORAMMB OF THE SCENERY.
Amongst the many interesting inciilents with which the piece abounds is the arrival of Travellers at the Cottage of Baptiste, wh«,
in league with the desperate band, aided hv his Sons, makes several attempts to accomplish

THE MURDER OF RAYMOND,
Who is informed of his Danger hy Marguerite, by means of

A

BLOOD-STAINED

PILLOW,

With which she furnishes his Bed, and is by her prevented from swallowing a sleeping potion mixed with his drink
by Baptiste, whom he overcomes at the moment he is about to perpetrate the Murder of Agnes, ihd assisted by
Marguerite, A C C O M P L I S H E S H I S D E A T H , by means of a concealed pannel, leading to a lone path
through the Forest; they, accompanied by Marguerite, escape the Banditti, and arrive at the C A S T L E O F
L I N D E N B U R 6 . At length, Raymond, amongst a train of Adventures in pursuit, of Agnes, encounters the
S P E C T R E N U N , whom he discovers to be the Mother of Agnes, and to whose shade he swears from that
moment to protect her offspring; he afterwards fulfils her oath by rescuing her from the Cave of the Robbers.

A Terrific Broad Sword Combat between Don Raymond and Robert.
THE GHOST OP THE MURDERED AGNES, being appeased, blesses the union of her Child with her Deliverer, which
terminates the Drama, forming an interesting Conclusion.

In order to give due effect to this Metropolitan Favorite, an Engagement has been entered into, for

TO THE PUBLIC.—In the production of this most extraordinary Drama, some apology, or explanation, may he deemed necessary. In the
Literary Gazette appeared an article uhich completely meets the qiies'tion: First, Is it necessary that every publication should he framed for the
express purpose of pointing a moral ? Secondly, Does Jack Sheppard succeed or fail in this onject ? And, Thirdly, Do such objects oiler Ittfr
materials to exercise the talent of authors, and afford public gratification, without injury to the public mind ? To the first inquiry wo are bound
to concede, that, much as we value moral inculcation, to udhcre to it as a sine qua non would he to exclude a mnllitmJe of pleasinir, playful, imaginative, and innocent productions, which has ever been the enjoyment of cultivated society. To the second the reply would be, that, so long as
human nature is human nature, and that there is gntlt as well as virtue, it may be as expedient to explore (he lower and darker recesses of viltany
as to develope the stilted crimes of tragedy In Mjfll places. Nay, as the former immediately affect and come in contact with the vast tmijnt ity of
our fellow-creatures, it is expedient to put the ignorant many on their gnunl against the seductions of common vice and the invasions ol hold brutality. The main point, therefore, comes, after all, to be the treatment "f the theme. Are we made to feel n deeper concern for the scoundrel
and murderer than for the wronged and good ? Is criminality made prosperous, and honour and honesty (.ilas! too often suffering in the real
world) held up to disregard and odium ? Hut we lind none of these offences in Jack Sheppard; and as Kielding has chosen "Jonathan Wild"
as his "great man," to barb the Keenest shafts of irony against crime, so do we think Mr. Ahtsivorth has, in an entirely different and more popular manner, elected bis ruffian victim, Jack Sheppaid, to demonstrate that there is no mortal nulla virfttte redemptum ; that depravity, however
covered by bravado, is sure to entail compunction and punishment; ;md that unequal as are the fates of the bid and the good, the preponderance
of suffering rests with the former, and the balance of even earthly comfort with the hitter class. Our author lias curiously, though incidentally,
supported this view, by supposing that Hogarth look the hint of his vigorous anil impressive lesson of I mlustry and Idleness (in the two apprentices) from seeing Jack Sheppard previous to his execution, when Ins portrait was painted by Sir James Thornhill: may we not also guess that
something of Mr. Ainsworth's story might have been suggested by Hogarth's pictures ? See Cruikshank's iniinitahle procession of Sheppard to
Tyburn; the buffoonery, the riot, the orgies, the triumph of sin, the incitement to rapine and bloodshed ; and compare them with the sad and
solemn administration of the law, the change effected within a century; and say whether the upholding of the past is not calculated to expedite
the further improvement of the future! In line, Jack Sheppard is
To all an example,
To no one n pattern,
and an ignominious death Is the just reward of an atrocious life. The touches of remorse and repentance with which it has pleased Mr. Ainsworth
to invest his closing career, are worthy of much commendation, not only as finishing the humanity of his conception, but as doing homage to the
invincible principles of conscience and retribution.

materials to exercise the talent of authors, and afford public gratification, without injury to the public mind ? To the first inquiry we are hound
to concede, that, much as we value moral inculcation, to adhere to it as a sine qua non would be to exclude a multitude of pleasing, playful, icuaginative, and innocent productions, which has ever been the enjoyment of cultivated society. To the second the reply would be, that, so long «*
human nature is human nature, and that there is guilt as well as virtue.it miiy he as expedient to explore the lower and darker recesses of villany

and murderer than for the wronged and good ? Is criminality made prosperous, and honour and honesty (alas! too often suffering in the real
world) held up to disregard and odium ? Hut we find none of these offences in Jack Sheppard; and as Fielding has chosen "Jonathan Wild"
as his ** great mini," to barb the keenest shafts of irony against crime, so do we think Mr. Ainsworth has, in an entirely different and more popular manner, elected his ruffian victim. Jack 8heppard> to demonstrate that there is no mortal nulla virtutc rvdanptttux; that depravity, however
covered by bravado, is sure to entail compunction and punishment; and that unequal as are the fates of the bid and the good, the preponderance
of suffering rests with the former, and the balance of even earthly comfort with the latter class. Our author has curtouslv, though incidentally,
mpported this view, by supposing that Hogarth took the hint of his vigorous and impressive lesson of Industry and Idleness (in the tivo apprentices) from seeing Jack Sheppard previous to his execution, when his portrait was painted by Sir James Thorn hill: may we not also guess that
something of Mr. Ainsworth's story might have been suggested by Hogarth's pictures ? See OniksbanU's inimitable procession of Sheppard t«
Tyburn; the buffoonery, the riot, the orgies, the triumph of sin, the incitement to rapine and bloodshed ; and compare them with the sad and
solemn administration of the law, the change effected within a century; and cay whether the upholding of the past is not calculated to expedite
the further improvement of the future! In fine, Jack Sheppard is
To alt an example,
To no one a pattern,
and an ignominious death is the just reward of an atroeious life. The touches of remorse and repentance with which it has pleased Mr, Ainsworth
to invest his closing career, are worthy of much commendation, not only as finishing the humanity of his conception, hut as doing homage to •the

Mrs. K E E L E 1 Jack Sheppard,
Mr. Y A T E S as Mendez,
Mr. P A U L B E D F O R D Blueskin
TO THE PUBLIC,—In the production of this most extraordinary Drama, some apolo<rv, or explanation, may be deemed necessary. In the
Literary Gazette appeared an article which completely meets the question: First, Is it necessary that every publication should be framed for the
express purpose of pointing a moral? Secondly, Does Jack Sheppard succeed or f.iil in this object? And, Thirdly, Do such objects offer fair
materials to exercise the talent of authors, and afford public gratification, without injury to the public mind ? To the first inquiry we are bound
to concede, that, much as we value moral inculcation, to adhere to it as a nine qua mm would be to exclude a multitude of pleasing-, playtul, imaginative, and innocent productions, which has ever been the enjoyment of cultivated society. To the second the reply would be, that, so long as
human nature is human nature, and that there is guilt as well as virtue, it m;.y be as expedient to explore the lower and darker recesses of villany
ns to develope the stitled crimes of tragedy in high places. Nay, as the former immediately affect and come in contact with the vast majority of
our fellow-creatures, it is expedient to put the ignorant many on their guard against the seductions of common vice and the invasions of bold brutality. The main point, therefore, comes, after all, to he the treatment of the theme. Are we made to feel a deeper concern for the scoundrel
and murderer than for tit e wronged and good? Is criminality made prosperous, and honour and honesty (alas! too often suffering In the real
world) htdd up to disregard and odium? But we find none of the offences in Jack Sheppardx and as Fielding has chosen "Jonathan Wild"
as his " great man," to barb the keenest shafts of irony against crime, so do we think Mr. Ainsworth has, in an entirely different and more popular manner, elected his ruffian victim Jack Sheppard, to demonstrate that there is no mortal nulla virtutc redemption; that dedravity, however
covered by bravado, is sure to entail compunction and punishment: and that unequal as are the fates of the bad and the good, the preponderance
of snrfeiiny rests with the former, and the balance of even earthly comfort with the latter class. Our author has cnriouslv, though incidentally,
supported this view, by supposing that Hogarth took the hint of his vigorous and impressive lesson of Industry and Idleness (in the two apprentices) from seeing Jack Sheppard previous to his execution, when bis portrait was painted by Sir James Thornhill : may we not also guesB that
something of Mr. Ainsworth • story might have been suggested by Hogarth's pictures? See Ouikshiink's inimitable procession of Sheppard to
Tyburn ; the buffoonery, the riot, the orgies, the triumph of sin, the incitement to rapine and bloodshed ; and compare them with the sad and
solemn administration of the law, the change effected within a century ; and say whether the upholding of the past is not calculated to expediate
the further improvement of the future ! Infine,Jack Sheppard is
To all an example,——To no one, a pattern,
ami an ignominious death is the just reward of an atrocious life. The touches of remorse and repentance with wh'n h it has pleased Mr. Ainsworth
to invest bis closing career, are worthy of much commendation, not only as finishing the humanity of his conception, but as doing homage to the
invincible principles of conscience and retiibution.

Will be presented, (nr». time,) preceded by a New MEDLEY OVERTAKE by Mr. J. M. JOLLY, a Drama of peculiar const Miction, founded on
ami embracing all the leading features of the Original and justly Popular Work, by " UOZ," under the title of

PROGRESS.
albeit in its worst lijrht, and shewing the manner in which youth is tm-

THE Stage is never devoted to a more noble or better purpose than when
it lends its powerful aid to improve the morals, and correct the vices, of
the age. It is this conviction which lias led to the adaptation of the
impressive Work upon which this Drama is founded, opening one of the
darkest volumes of life, and revealing facts that must startle, the more
strongly, from the previous total ignorance of their existent*', even by
those persons residing in the very heart of the scenes in which they are
daily and nightly passing-. Nothing can be more useful and salutary
than the knowledge of such facts to the Public »t large, against whom
the offences of which they consist are practised, and the consciousness
of their possessing such knotvlodga bv the individuals themselves employed in the commission of them. '• folding the mirror up to nature,"

suspeetedly seduced into crime—unmasking the nurseries of guilt—
pointing out the receptacles of plunder—and warning the victims both
sinned against and sinning.
Thus it will be seen in this Drama. Its great original, who, verbally
speaking, may truly he turned akin to MOCAHTH, has raised a beacon on
the basis of truth to warn the erring, guide the ii.experien.ed, instruct
the ignorant to avoid the shoals by which they are surrounded, and forcibly inculcate the great moral lesson, that vice, however prosperous for
a time, will, sooner or later, meet with punishment and disgrace; while
virtue, whatever be its trials and temptations, will ultimately secure a
lasting and just reward.

This present TUESDAY

EVENING, MAY 19, 1840,

Will be presented, (s'cot d time,) preceded by a New M EDLEY OVERTURE hy Mr. J. M. JOLLY, a Drama of
peculiar construction, fonnded on
and mnbracimr all the leading features of the Original and justly Popular Work, bv " BOX,'1 under the title of

Oliver Twist!

Or, T H E P A R I S H BOY'S PROGRESS.
THE Stage i* never devoted to a mure noble or better purpose than when albeit in its worst lijrht, and shewing the manner in which youth is nn-

suspectedly seduced into crime—unmasking the nurseries of gnilt—
pointing out the receptacles of plunder—ami warning the victims both
sinned against and sinning.
Thus it will be seen In this Drama. Its great original, who, verbally
speaking, may truly be termed akin to HOOSRTH, has raised a beaconon
the basis of truth to warn the erring, guide the inexperienced, instruct
the ignorant to avoid the shoals by which they are surrounded, and forcibly inculcate the great moral lesson, that vice, however prosperous for
a time, will, sooner or later, meet with punishment and disgrace; while
virtue, whatever he its trials and temptations, will ultimately secure a
lasting and just reward.

it lends its powerful aid to improve the morula, and correct the vice*, of
the age. It is this conviction which has led tfl the adaptation of the
impressive Work upon which this Drama is founded, opening one of the
darkest volumes of life, and revealing facts that must startle, the more
strongly, from the previous total ignorance of their existence, even by
those persons residing in the very heart of the scenes in which they are
daily and nightly passing. Nothing can he more useful anil salutary
than the knowledge of such facts to the Public at large, against whom
the offences of which they consist are practised, and the consciousness
oi their possessing such knowledge by the individuals themselves employed in the commission of thvin. " Holding the minor up to nature,"

" It was bleak, dark, and piercing cold—it was a night for the wellhoused and fed to draw round the bright fire, and thank God they were
at home; and for the homeless stsrviiig wretch, to lay him down and
die. Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets at
such times', who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly
open them in a more bitter world "

" Mr. Bumble's conduct, on being left to himself, was rather ineiplicahle. He opened the closet, counted th« teaspoons, weighed the sugar

genuine metal; and having satisfied his curiosity upon these points, put
on his cocked bat corner ways, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table.''

and embracing? all the leading features of the Original and justly popular Work, by l* ROSS," under the title of

Oliver Twist !
Or, T H E PARISH BOY'S PROGRESS.

THIS Stape is never devoted to a more noble or better purpose than when
it lends its powerful aid to improve the morals, HIH! correct the rtces, of
the age. It is tins conviction which has led to the adaptation of the
impressive Work upon which this Drama is founded, opening- one of the
darkest volumes of life, and revetting facts that must startle, the more
stlOOghjf, from the previous total Ignorance of their existence, even by
those persons residing in the very heart of the scenes in which they are
dailv and nightly peesing. Nothing' can be more useful and salutary
than the knowledge of such facts to the Fabric at large, against whom
the offences of which they consist are practised, and the consciousness
of their possessing such knowledge by the individuals themselves employed in the commission of them. " Holding the mirror up to nature,"

albeit in its worst lljcht, and shewing the manner in which youth is tinsuspectedly seduced into crime — uiiruasUing the nurseries of gnilt—
pointing out the receptacles of plunder—and warning the victims both
sinned against and sinning.
Thus it will he seen in this Drama. Its great original, who, verbally
speaking, may truly be termed akin to (Jorum H, has raised <t beaeou oe
the basis of truth to warn the erring, guide the inexperienced, instruct
the ignorant to avoid the shoals by which they are surrounded, and forcibly inculcate the great moral lesson, that vice, however prosperous for
n time, will, sooner or later, meet with punishment and disgrace; wtttle
virtue, whatever be its trials and temptations, will ultimately secure a
lasting and just reward.

This present WEDNESDAY Evening, November 25, 1840.
U N E X P E C T E D DISCOVERY ! !!
The " March of Intellect," and the •• March of Mind," have been phrases in the months of all. during the MarcH of
Erents, for many years, from March till March again. Wonder has succeeded Wonder, till that which a Generation
ago would have*been thought impossible, has become fact of every-day occurrence. Bnt of all the extraordinary circumstances hourly evolving, the most extraordinary is THE KECEN'l ATTEMPT to drain the Jewellers' and other
shops of vast quantities of plain gold, or (what is vulgarly called) Wedding Rings. It was at first supposed, the crowds
of blooming Damsels, and interesting Widows, who seemed the wi lling agents in the above design, bad been itKhieed—
led on—or suborned— by the example of an ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE ; but the vigilance of the male portion of
society being doubly excited by its increased ami EXTREME DANGER, after many fruitless efforts—much watching— and late getiiiiifs home at night, A SECRET SOCIETY has been discovered, the object of which (as will be
Mtal is to overturn all the established usages of the community, and to place OTHER RULERS AT THE HELM.
The following Extracts, showing the fearful object in view, is published from their MYSTBKIOUS PAPERS.—
" Man having long been absolute—having in his arrogance proclaimed himself * Creation's Lord and Master!'— having
framed Law,, inflicting Penalties, from which he alone it exempt:— We, the undersigned Victim; inspired by the proof
exhibited in one Illustrious Establishment, of the success of Petticoat Government and Female Domination—and seeing
no reason why we, who bare the loudest voices in private affairs, should be entirely deprived of one in those of a public
nature—hereby resolve, that for the better protection of our dormant Rights and Privileges—for the enforcing some

The "March of Intellect," and the "March of Mind," have been phrases in the mouths of nil, during the March of
Events, for 'many yeiirs, from March tit! March ajfain. Wonder has succeeded Wonder, till that which a (feneration
Eg-o would have been thought impossible, h:is become fact of rvery day occurrence. But of all the extraordinary circumstances hourly evolving, the most extraordinary is THE REt/RNT ATTEMPT to drain tJie Jewellers' and other
shops of vast quantities of plain gold, or (what is vulgarly called) Wedding Rings. It was at first supposed, the crowds
of hfooiniug Damsels, and interesting Widows, who seemed the willing agents in the above design, had been induced—
led on-—or suborned—by the example of an ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE; but the vigilance of the male portion of
society being doubly excited by its increased and EXTREME MANGER, after many fruitless efforts—moch watchi"g— and late gettings borne at night, A SECRET SOCIETY has been discovered, the object of which (as will be
seen) is to overturn all the established usages of the community, and to place OTHER RULERS AT THE HELM.
The following Extracts, showing ihejettrful object in view, is published from their MYSTERIOUS PAPERS:—
*• Man having long been absolute—having in his arrogance proclaimed himself' Creation's Lord and Master!'—having
fnuiied Laws, inflicting Penalties, from which he alone is exempt:—We, the undersigned Victims, inspired by the proof
e'Jiibited in one Illustrious Establishment, ofthe success of Petticoat Government and Female Domination—and seeing
no reason why we, who have the loudest voices in private affairs, should be entirely deprived of one in those of a public

H|^T3^ZJ History tells us Tales of Female Heroism of such marvellous Character, that had we not, from time to time reiterated proof, we might
•feU?
look on those Meteors of their Age—the "JOANS Of ARC and FLANDERS,"—and the equally wonderful " J E A N N E OF
IIEA U VAIS," as the mere offspring of imagination, fostered and immortalized by Superstition and Tradition; but from period to period in succeeding times, from amid the Fire of War and the Horrors of Carnage, impelled by Love, and by Filial Vengeance, have arisen instances of
Female Courage and Devotion—which, in the midst of Flames, and even at the Cannun's mouth, have rescued Cities, and preserved the nobly
Brave from what seemed certain annihilation. Witness "THE MATRON OF SHSSOLONGHI," and " T H E MAID OF SARRAGOSSA."
The GREAT NAPOLEON, who well knew the power of example, and the pride of memory, hastened to do justice to the immortal deed of the
'• HEROINE OF THE HATCHET ;" he erected a Statue to her Fame in the Town she had defended, and ordained that forever.on the Anniyersary of the Day made illustrious by her deed, in ereryliaine, Festival, or Procession, " T H E WOMEN OF BEAUVAIS SHOULD HOLD
PRECEDENCE "OF THE MEN."
