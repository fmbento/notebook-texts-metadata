Will be performed the Moral and' Interesting Tragedy of

BarNweIN
Or, the JLouiton *AtMpimeutice*

Since the institution of the Drama, to the present clay, no Dramatic Fiece has done more service to society than this
admirable Tragedy; and, if to point out the allurement's of vice as a warning to nnthinUng youth to avoid the snares of
debauchery be the business of the Stage, its powers were never more justly or more effectually exerted. The crime* nod
misfortunes of the unhappy GKOHOB BAHNWELL ure held up as an awful monitor to youth ; and amongst other inatane-* of
»tage effect over the pawsions, the following anecdote is a lasting proof of its fascinating power both to improve the mormU,
<md amend the heart.
In London, some yean* since, a young gentleman in the mercantile line, had, in an unguarded moment, made free with %
considerable sum of money, the property of h - employer; chance, that evening directed him to Drury-Lunc, where the
performance of

Mr. R O S S i n t h e C h a r a c t e r o f G E O R G E B A R N W E L L ,

•truck his miud so forcibly, that self-conviction, attended by severe remorse, compelled him to repltcc the money ao disgracefully obtained : and by a life of strict honor and integrity ever after, he amply atoned for a temporary deviation fro-*
ibe paths of virtue.
" I've heard that guilty creatures sitting at a piny have, by the very cunning of the scene, b«en so struck to the «oo|.
that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions."—Shahspeare.
So sensible was this gentleman that to the Theatre alone lie stood indebted for this happy change, he ever after presentee!

B r . R O S S , o n lift Benefit Night, w i t h a ClOO B a n k N o t e f o r a T i c k e t ,
And constantly acknowledged his obligation to this excellent Tragedy—a Tragedy that will engraft such principles on yo-Ofj
minds, as to eondaee to their future happiness through the pleasing medium of rational entertainment.

Begs respectfully to ahnounce to the Public of Cork, that being unwilling to raise a doubt in the Public mind of fet
Jtuth of his statements, or the respectability of his Management, he has hitherto carefully avoided any Puffs or Panegyrics •
Wting, that after the patient aiid Indefatigable exertions of Twenty-Two nightly Performances, the Public report would
halt- proved his best recommendation, and that some disposition would be gradually evinced to support

The most respectable,—The most talented,—And the best organized Company,

The nightly attendance haB been of the most scanty description, though he has every reason to believe, that his AulienCW have; been invariably assured of his well-founded claims to Public Support.
Ill justice to his Company, Mr. Btnuiouans is obliged to continue the Season, 'till the various Performers can furniih
tbetnselve* with other Engagements i such being his imperative duty—he has had recourse to a last expedient;—not with

WIFE

To conclude with, (never acted here) an Old English Dohiestic Drama of intense interest, called the

OF

Seven Husbands!
Or, The Origin of Coroners' Inquests.

The hietorl-al fact Upon -which this inteusclv interesting Drama i3 constructed, may be found in the various Histories of
London but more particularly in the Chronicles of Stow, &c. Strange ae it may appear to the many,—to thie circumetauce
we . r e chiefly indebted for our CORONER'S IMI.UH.ST, by which no person suspected of coming by his death mysteriously, or
bv improper means, can be buried without a Jury of his countrymen have first decided upon the nature of his death. " 'Hie
Wife says the Legend," through the instigation of her Seventh Husband, was apprehended, tried, and found guilty of
Z t t r treason and waa burnt to death in Smtthfield; and so great a noise did this story make, that in the course of the \ear
. S t a t u t e was passed by Edward the First, to settle the office of Coroner, the duties ot him and the Jury he should summon
t i attend him."

The hero and heroine, the once gay Mark Rcdland, now Murdofk tln» Robber, Rose Briarly once the pride of the village, the
Robber", Wife I—-Their appearance and condition changed—their complexions stained, their hair dyed !'—the mi-erable tenant, Of
a wretched hovel, bearing the semblance of an Inn, to hire the unwary traveller to plunder and outrage; Murdock is tin; chief of n
gang of Coiners, among whom is Sawney Macfiie, whose vocation is that of a guide to decoy travellers to the Inn. Two travellers
arrive under the guidance of Macfile ; the one, a stranger returning to IKS native village after a long absence; the other hit. attorney.
MurdocV offers to take charge of the stranger's portmanteau , he refuses to part with it, and produces his pistols. Rose is sent by
Murdock to remove the pistols while the strangei sleeps—she approaches and sees the portmanteau—she thinks she has seen it
before,—she drops on her knees to examine it—the buckles—the straps—and yet so many years have pasBed, that recollection,
may not be trusted. She turns her eyes on the stranger—his face is covered—with a trembling hand she draws away the handkerchief, and discovers with horror and amazement, the tenures of her father.
This is a brief sketch of the first and second Acts ; but the third abounds with the most interesting situations, which, to detail
them here, would be to deprive them of their intei est.

AND T H E LAST NIGHT B U T T W O OF T H E

On MONDAY Evening, Feb. 21, 1831,
Will be produced an entirely New Historical, Nautical, and Domestic Melo Drama, in 3 Acts, by the Author
of " Black-Eyed Susan," to be called

PABAEJI;
Or, T H E MUTINY AT T H E NORE!

^

" There ii, peih.pl, no Event in the Annals of our HUtory," (remarks C'API\ MA.n.»AT»."the Author of • THB KINO*. OWN,' himself a
N.T.I Officer, and to whose woTk t h . writer of the present Drama is indebted for a pathetic Incident, with some general information on the
.•inject), "which excited more alarm at the time of its occurrence, or has been the subject of more general interest, than the MOIINY AT
THE NOSE, in 1TW.—Forty thousand men to whom the Nation looked for defence from its surrounding enemies, and In sted'asl reliance of
whose bravery It laid down every night in tranquillity. Men' who h*d dared every thing for their Kin- and Country, and in whose breast
patriotism, although suppressed for a time, could never be extinguished ; turned the Guns which they had so often manned in the defence of
the English Flag, against their own Countrymen and their own home; and with all the acrimony of feeling ever attending family quarrels
seemed determined to sacrifice the nation and themselves, rather than listen to the dictates of reason and conscience."
The present Drama, whilst it presents a true picture of the Mutiny, which for a time deprived the Nation of its Surest and proudest
defence, the Bulwark of Its Wooden Walls, faithfully develupes the characters of the chief Actors in the Rebellion, their assumption of their
superiority to their flotl acknowledgment of discipline ; an order, since that period, unbroken by disaffection; and which nnder the august
and paternal ear* of him. who is the Head and Pride of the British Navy, must proceed increasing in benefits to the service itself, and
oonseqaently in value to fh« Country at large.

Soldiers returned from the Wars are enjoying the Blessings of Peace, when their interest is aroused, and they
adventure as Citizens in the Cause of Friendship. Great anxiety is excited by the

Perilous Situation or the Sergeant's W i f e ;
She, however, is providentially protected by a brave veteran, and the interest increases, Much ludicrous situation
ensues, yet does not obstruct the great end of the Piece; it combines, relieves, and enlivens, and in no way mars
the g » a t object in view.

Mr. HARNETT

l nder peculiar circumstances addresses his patrons, friends, and the public in general; he begs leave to state, that in entering
on the concern, he took the Theatre as a yearly tenant, and in the hope of obtaining a Lease for long continuance. He now
finds the pro|ierty was mortgaged to SIR JOHN SOANE, who, he is given to understand, has bargained fur its sale. To what
t.-irpoue it may eventuidly be converted is doubtful. He therefore entreats the support of the admirer, of the Drama on the
present occasion, since he is forced with extreme regret to say that this will probably be

The story of Massaniello is from historical facts, and founded on one of the most momentous events in the recorded annals
of Naples. Extreme interest is excited by the fate of Fenella, the Dumb Girl of Portici, who in her E S C A P E

the Fugitive. The assembled Fisherman in consultation. Massaniello, absorbed in gloomy apprehension for the fate of his
country and safety of his sister, at length perceives her on the rock, where she seems intent to pinnae
into the Sea,
On seeing her Brother, impelled by affection she descends and rushes into his arms. Massa.iiello exhorts his Countrymen to
spurn the Spanish Yoke, and give Freedom to Naples ! Various incidents occur, and the scene closes with a
Vahleau.
Proceeding to the Second Act, the Prince and Princess resolve to protect Fenella—The Officer is sent in search, but contrary
to the benevolent intentions of his superiors, uses threats and violence—is resisted by Massaniello—overpowered—and
Massaniello exalted ! After various incidents the Chief Magistrate surrenders to Massanidlo the Keys
of the
City,
The Prince and Princess take refuge in the Cottage of Massaniello—Fenella's Generosity triumphs—She gives them an
Asylum—Massaniello accords with her views, and secures their safety by the Shield
of Hospitality.
Intoxicated
with power Massaniello becomes tyrannic, and the People murmur. Advance of the Evening. Alarm of Fenella for the

GRECIAN STATUES

To those who have not witnessed this extraordinary performance, it is hardly possible to convey an idea of the effect produced on the mind by one of
i most pleasing illusions ever presented to the public. The most celebrated Statues of Antiquity are represented in rapid succession ; so surprising and
iderfui is the effect, that the spectator may fancy himself ranging the Galleries of Rome and Florence, surrounded by those splendid efforts of human
uius which have survived the wreck of time, and are the admiration and delight of the civilized world. The poet, the painter, and the literary world
ve contributed their meed of praise to this astonishing perfection of classical display.

The whole to conclude, with appropriate Scenery Dresses, &c. &c, the Romantic and highly interesting Melo
Drama, performed in London upwards of one Hundred nights, called—The

MILLER fc HIS MEN,
OR,

The ROBBERS OF BOHEMIA.
In the country of Bohemia, on the borders of one of those extensive forests so favourable to the desperate
excursions of a Banditti, the author of this interesting melo-drama has fixed the Miller and his Men.—The
Miller, from being a menial servant in the family of Count Friberg, rises by unknown means to be the master
of rich and extensive possessions.—The apparent source of this wealth is the produce of his mill; but under
the disguise of an honest employment, the Miller and his Men are engaged in the most atrocious acts, and
•he mill is in reality the receptacle of plunder, and under it are extensive Caverns, in which are concealed a
Banditti the terror of Bohemia. Wolf (under the assumed name of Grindoff the Miller) is their Captain.—
^earful of detection, and dreadful in revenge, he fixes beneath the Mill a Magazine of Powder, that in the
event of discovery, it may sacrifice with himself his pursuers. The Piece is well imagined, and the scenes
follow with much interest, and has been performed with the greatest success at the Theatre Royal, Covent
Garden.

PROGRAMME.—TIMOUR having murdered the reigning Prince, and usurped the throne of Mingrelia,
keeps the young Prince Agib confined in the dungeons of the Castle. At this time, news arrives that the Princess of Georgia, whom Timour is going to espouse, is on her way to the Palace. On her arrival, Oglou, the
•ather of Timour, recognizes the Queen of Mingrelia in the pretended Princess of Georgia, who has assumed
that character to obtain possession of her infant son. Octar, who has been detained prisoner in Georgia, makes
•lis escape and informs Timour of the deception, Timour directly orders the imprisonment of the Queen, of whom
he is really become enamour'd, swearing "she shall become his bride or Agib's blood bedew the scaffold 1" O^lou
. ontrives an interview between the mother and son, which is disturbed by Timour, who commands the marriage
c eremony to be performed within one hour. This is the most interesting situation in the piece; while the Queen
is answering Timour, Oglou, by means of his turban, lowers the young Prince from a window, he is caught by the
Jeorgians below. The tyrant in despair drags the Queen to the battlements and is about to be slain by Orasmin,
•vhen Oglou throws himself before him bidding the Queen remember that he spared her son, and now entreats

The Story of this beautiful Dramatic production is taken from a German Legend. Albert, a Nobleman (attended by hist
Valet Willibald,) sets forth on a Tour, to the Alps, Italy, &c. On his arrival at Venice in his Gondola is Hurprised and delighted
at the Magnificence of the Buildings. Nicola, a Spaniard possessor of the Bottle Imp, invites Albert to a Splendid Banquet; he thert
endeavours to dispose of the Bottle to him, and informs hiin that whoever possesses the Bottle with the Imp inclosed, can command
from it as much Gold as he desires, but by the Compact every Possessor must SELL IT FOR A LESS SUM THAN ITS ORIGINAL COST. Albert then purchases the Bottle Imp, and Indulges in Riot and Luxury.

THE

BOTTLE

I M P A P P E A R S T O H I M I N H I S B E D ROOM,

Enveloped in RED FIRE, and tells him he may be the envy of the World during the DAY, but NIGHT mu-st come ; Albert then
determines upon Selling the Bottle, and commands his Servant Willibald to that effect. Willibald not succeeding in the Sale resolves to buy it himself. Keeping the secret from his Master, but on learning the dreadful Mystery attached to the Bottle, thoughts
of home recur to his mind, and he wishes himself again with his Little Brothers & Sistf rs, when immediately they are heard Singing their well known Song of Mirth. "He wishes he could see them now" when they instantly appear in tiieir Night Clothes.—
Albert now reduced in fortune and afflicted by Remorse of conscience

E N L I S T S I N T H E ARMY AND IS U L T I M A T E L Y CONDEMNED TO B £ SHOT,
for the loss of his Canteen, but is pardoned by the interposition of Marcelia.

T h e Bottle I m p is again p u r c h a s e d b y Nicolo for t h e smallest Coin in t h e World,
who is horror stricken at the appearance of the Bottle Imp amidst theflamesof the Holy Inquisition.

h e whole to conclude with (first time in this Theatre), the new Grand and Historical Drama, entitled

ARL

Nil

Of Sweden; or the Siege of Stralsund.
The incidents on which this drama is founded, are perfectly historical.
The character of this extraordinary Monarch
exhibits one distinguishing feature,—surpassing valour.
He sought the bubble reputation " e'en in the cannon's mouth,"
Major Vanberg having been unjustly declared a traitor, assumes the name of Firman, and becomes the landlord of a small Inn ; he
and his daughter Ulrica are secured and protected by Adam Brock, a substantial farmer, blunt, honest and humane, and sixteen
years back had sent his only son and a certain sum of money, by way of loan, to his Sovereign.
Years passed away without any
offer of repayment from the King.
After an absence of sixteen years, Charles is about to return to his Capital, and in his way
thither travelling incog., stops at the Inn kept by Vanberg, is directed to the farm of Adam Brock, whither he hastes to repay his
debt of gratitude, he announces himself a messenger sent by the King, to discharge the debt, and produces the order for payment,
which Hrock obstinately refuses to accept, and cancels a debt of the State, by committing the order to theflames: a hint to all
(hanccllors of the Exchequer.
Singular situation the Monarch is placed in by assuming the name of Colonel llekhet.

DEAL,

16th, 1884.

...

Although the Proprietor regrets the troubling the Public with any
private concern between himself and another Individual, yet having been much
misrepresented in a Printed "Notice to the Public," put forth by Mr?Dereson, of
.his Town, he relies on the Justice of that Public in hearing both sides of the
(uestion before they decide on either,
•

Mr. Dcveson asserts he was refused admission for a Friend of his
to the T h e a t r e last night by the direction of the Manager, Mr. D , never conde*ehded to ask or make his intentions known to the Manager on the subject, had he
lone so, it would have been most willingly acceded to, or had the manager been at
the Thvatre when Mr. D . behaved so improperly there, still his Friend would h«ve
nstantly been admitted, the fact is Mr. JSavill was confined to his room by Illness &
new nothing of what transpired till Mr. Deveson forced himself rudely into his
Apartments and treated him with the most gross abuse. This refusal of Admission
>r Mr. Deveson's Friend, which was never asked, or intimation given thereof is
the Alleged Offence vf Mr. Savill, but the Real Offence is Mr. SSavill having a
Printing Office of his own, consequently publishies his own Bills of Performance
not that a Portion of the Printing has not been given to Mr. D. and more mio-ht
have followed, as Mr. Savill has made it his study to deal to the utmost of his means
with the T r a d e s m e n of t h e T o w n , but he does not choose to be threatened by Mr.
Deveson to furthur dealings with him, and for this Heal Crime which has long
rankled in the breast of Mr, Deveson a Seeming one must be imputed, it was hathed up accordingly last night, when in his abuse to the Proprietor Mr. D . let out
his real motives, threatening him with the destruction of all future Patronage in the
T o w n of Deal, and Banishment therefrom, he Mr. D. havingsufficent influence with
tKe Local and Legal Authorities of the Place, to prevent them ever granting him
future Admission to perform in the town of Deal, Mr. D. proceeds to make a hit at
.*ie " I r o n Bound Liberality of the Manager, in a shape of the Pun it is supposed alSuding to the Frame W o r k of the T h e a t r e being of that materia], but it is so III Fbred that it cannot by any Fire of Genius be tempered into W i t .
The Apology to the Audience which concludes the placard had better been omitted, as Mr. D. before
e performances began, stated openly that he would not Si/117 th<- Song advertised in the Bills unless there watt Good Houa., a Good House there was but no one appeared' to miss or rail for the :*ong in question, Tho
Manager is glad however that Mr. D. hus put some of that Ire to print he haw so long Dissenim mated in
Private, as it may be the means of Evaporating it, spread forth as it now is to PUBLIC NOT ICE.
Mr. SAVILL in concluding this subject, leaving both statements in the hands of the Public
•v judge whether he has been falsely accused or not, and refers *he.u to more th in 20 yeirs Public Character in
rt County of Kent, for the Actioai ivjich h-i/v always ^ J J J J J hm coaJavt, thai osiualteJ by a Priv-it^ Enemy
iod for Private Ends.

TO THE
I n justice to myself, and to g u a r d against
misrepresentation, t conceive it necessary briefly to explain the circumstances which prevented
my S i n g i n g at the T h e a t r e last E v e n i n g , as •
a n n o u n c e d in the Bills.
To give effect to the Song, I had occasion to
borrow a Jacket, &c., of a young person in the
Town, to whom I promised admission to the House,
as a remuneration for his kindness; on my requesting this favor, however, it was rudely and peremptorily refused by the Doorkeeper, acting, as he afterwards acknowledged, under the direction of the
Manager. Astonished, and, in fact, hurt at such
selfish and ill natured conduct, I was betrayed into
a warmth of feeling, and immediately quitteel the
Theatre, indignantly disgusted with such irOnbound
illiberality.
To the Audience, I beg sincerely to apologise
for any dissappointment thus occasioned, and to
assure them of the pleasure I should otherwise
have received in the honor of appearing before

Or, t h e FOREST of BOND Y.

The great Moral so eloquently pi oduced in this Drama, tends to fix our attention stronger upon that POWFR that rules and watches over us all.—A base Murder
perpetrated upon a young and amiable Man, and the foul design of attempting to implicate an unfortunate dumb Boy, are all frustrated by one of Heaven's humblest creations—the F A I T H F U L DOG! In railing the public attention to this Drama, the Manager pledges himself to produce it regardless of expence.

This Drama is founded on a Murder which was committed in WARWICKSHIRE, in the Spring of 1817, a crime whicfi"
eKcited one universal feeling of horror and indignation. Great was the regret of all, that a person whom there was too
much reason to believe the perpretrator of this dreadful act, was suffered to escape condign punishment. The purpose
of this Drama is to shew that although VICE may for a time triumph, a just Power never fails to punish in this world,

On FRIDAY Evening December .9, 1806.

P O I N T OF HONOUR.
DURIMEL, a foldier in the fetvice of France, having been provoked to (hike an. Officer, deferts from h<« reginvnt to avoid the punifbmcnr which awaits fo glaring an infriugcmciu of the ,a vi or fubortUjation, He ii fortunate
ClKHigh to ptocure mercantile employment in the houft of a.widc>w lady, on the borders of Switzerland, and an
.1! achrocnt to her daughter BERTHA, who returns his patfion, is in a (hurt time the confluence. I he m.inly
• e,;ritv of the young foldier induces him to difcover to the mother rhc predicament under which he lies, the parti..
o l a r s being overheard by a difappointed rival, he communicates the citcumftance to the Cfficers.of the French
regiment, at that time quartered in the village. TJie unfortunate lover is in confequ-nce apprehended as a deferter,
; . e i'lterell of the drama ttow commences. Durimr! has not feen his Father for many' ye*r» a.id the latter as a teteard for his gallant and meritorious fcrvices, had rifen from an inferior ftation in the army to lie a Major in this
, < ry regiment. He was one of the council who examined the Youth, felt himfelt bound to join in pronouncing
f'ntencc of death upon him, and is appointed to give the fatal fignal. At the moment of tie execution, the compii.. :ted diftrefs of a parent thus (ituated muft be obvious to every mind, the meeting letween lather and fon, in which
they recognize each other, in a fecne of affefting and highly-wrought tendernefs The remainder of the plav it
chiefly occupied in depicting the flroggles between ?. fcene of duty and panntal affection, which agitates the bread
ct the Major, and the diftrefs of Durimcl, every moment expcifting to be lummoned by his guards, agonized b . ' the
Jiiffraftion of Bertha, and overcome bv the deep affliction of his father. The bu'rfts of' grief and paflioD naturally
fl-iwing from thefe perplexities, are mixed with occufiorial fentiments of confo.ation, fortitude, phiiofophy, and religion. The POINT OF HONOUR is maintained by Durimel, in refufing to e cape when in his po-ver, and iti
refilling the Major's intreaty to avail himfelf of the favorable, opportunity-r-he will rather die than difgrace hi»
father's character, an awful and foleinn military pioceffion .now takes place for his execution—they proced to the
fatal fpot—the handkerchief is bound round bis head, and the niulket* are leveled at tht'ir objecf—rhe father endeavours to give the fignal but his refolution weavers, and he finks under the agony of his fensation*. A thought
-fuddenly occurs to him—he gives the word of command, and inllantly rulhes before the body of hi* fon. Every
erne is thrown into the utmoft conftemation—the rdationlhip is difcovcMO, and the deferter receivei a full pardon
for bis offence.

Presented the interesting Drama, (founded on facts) entitlod

The Miser
OF THE

There is a biographical fragment of John Overy to be found in Pennant's History of London. John Overy (or Overs as he is in
,ome places, called,) lived about the eleventh century, and rented a Ferrv before a brid-« was built across the Thames. He was
I wonder of penuriousness, and eventually owed his death to his passion for gain ; for believing that, should he counterfeit death, his apprenes would Iorego their customary scanty provision for the day, he suffered himseltto be laid oat as one who had departed this life. H i .
^prentices, however, rejoicing at the demue of the miser, assailed the cupboard, when Overy arose, and one of his men, mistaking his master
f a spectre, struck at him with the butt-end of an oar, and killed him on the spot. The daughter of John Overy wrote to her lover, the ti.gsof her father's death, and the young man instantly took horse and set off for Loudon : on his way he was thrown from his steed and
Soiled ; when Mary Overy entered a Monastery, which she endowed with the immense wealth left by her father. The monks, In admiration
b.f piety, built a church, to -which they gave her name, and which edifice is at the present day known as the Church of St. Mary Overy.
lese are fasts on which the present drama has been constructed. It will be observed, that for the sake of theatrical effect, the author has departed in many instances from-the History a« it stands here; but the whole form a chain of events, which produce the most thrilling and
eudid effect ever witnessed on the British Stage.

Or, The Maid of Milan.
As Performed One Hundred Nights at Covent Garden.
The name of HOME must ever carry with it.the most tender recollections. There is not a native, even of the
wildest regions, who, when removed hy circumstances far from those scenes where his earliest affections rose,
does not feel his heart softened into tenderness at the thought oi HOME ! This beautiful and interesting drama
presents tin' operation of this delightful feeling, with a « .Tenth and richness of colouring, never before attempted.
C L A R I , a young Itali/m peasant, has been induced to quit her home, by the persuasions and promises of a Nobleman ot Milan
In a moment of agony, she discovers the fallaciousness of the promi-es by which she has been
beguiled. Her thoughts then revert to the innocent and happy home she has quitted. Distracted at the painful
situation in which her imprudence has placed her, she resolves on flight, to seek that peac. ful home, which her
Jertei'tiou has converted into a wilderness of sorrow, and fling herself with penitence and remorse, at the feet of
her justly offended Parents ! To describe the denouement is impossible. It must be witnessed to be fully con.
eived.
