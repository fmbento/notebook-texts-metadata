T h e scene is laid in a village in France, where the fears of the villagers are in perpetual excitement Wy the
appearance of a supposed Phantom. T h e piece commences with the preparations for the nuptials of E d m u n d
and Ernestine; Colonel Rosambert arrives, is disturbed by the phantom appearing in his chamber, which in reality
is Ernestine walking in her sleep. Edmund with villagers, come in the morning and discover Ernestine on Roaambert's couch, he ar.uses her, upbraids her with infidelity, and declares his resolution not to wed ber; in
hysterical fits she is carried into the mill. E d m u n d immediately determines to marry Gertrude, Ernestine is
seen in the most awfully perilous situation, in danger of being dashed to pieces, should she make a false step, as
•he is again walkii.g in her sleep. I he attention of the audience now becomes rivetted to breathless expectation;
Ernestine descends by a high ruined wall, which falls away beneath her feet. She at length teaches the ground
in safety, speaks of the desertion of E d m u n d , who thus convinced of her innocence, places the ring on her finger
and arouses h e r ; an explanation takes place, and a reconciliation is effected. T h e whole comprising a series of
the most intensely interesting events that can possibly be brought together for dramatic representation.

MR. RAYNER,

I roui the Theatre Royal Covent Garden, & the Surrey Theutre, London, in TWO PRINCIPAL
and TWO of his AfOST CHOICE COMIC
SOSGS.

CH 4RACTKIt<i

ON MONDAY, A P R I L S , 1831,
Will I* presented a very faromite and iuterenting Drama, in three Act., called the

IDIOT
WETNESS;
Or, ft Tate of Hiooat
'
T h e Story of this piece is founded on historical facts, which occurred during the reign of Queen Elizabeth :
the leading features of which comprise the providential e s c a p e from assassination of an Orphan, Page to the
Queen, who has been received into royal favour, having saved the life of his illustrious mistress, and the interposition of providence in averting the foul deed, and in ultimately hurling destruction on the head of its perpetrator. The only evidence of the guilt of the Solitary of the heath, is Gilbert, who has assumed idiocy, by means
of which he has preserved his own life, and escaped from the gloomy walls of a dungeon, where he had been
confined upwards of eight years, and lives to be the instrument of destruction to the Sieur Arnaud, and the means
of restoring to his hereditary rights and honours, his Master's Son the Orphan Page. T h e serious incidents of
the piece are happily relieved by (he native humour of a British Seaman and his bold intrepidity in the cause of
justice.

T h e scene is laid in a village in France, where the fears of the villagers are in perpetual excitement by the
appearance of a supposed Phantom. T h e piece commences with the preparations for the nuptials of Edmund
and Ernestine; Colonel Rosamhcrt arrives, is disturbed by the phantom appearing in his chamber, which in reality
is Ernestine walking in her sleep. Edmund with villagers, come in the morning and discover Ernestine on Rosambert's couch, he aro.ses her, upbraids her with infidelity, and declares his resolution not to wed her; in
hysterical fits bhe is carried into the mill. E d m u n d immediately determines to marry Gertrude, Ernestine is
seen in the most awfully perilous situation, in danger of being dashed to pieces, should she make a false step, as
she is again walking in her sleep. T h e attention of the audience now becomes rivetted to breathless expectation;
Ernestine descends by a high ruined wall, which falls away beneath her feet. She at length reaches the ground
in safety, speaks of the desertion of Edmund, who thus convinced of her innocence, places the ring on her finger
and arouses her; an explanation takes place, and a reconciliation is effected. T h e whole comprising a series of
the most intensely interesting events that can possibly be brought together for dramatic representation.

THE

T h e domestic drama of F A T H E R and SON, lias been pronounced by one of the first Critics of the present
• lav, as a production illustiatinjr most forcibly the effect* of G U I L T upon the human mind. The Father is led
by imperceptible steps, from ;< trilling act of duplicity, to the appalling crime of murdering his favourite C h i l d ;
ilif dreadful catastrophe is only prevented by the interposition of the hand of Providence, shewn in the filial
affection of the Son to the Father, and the arousing of a feeling ol humanity in the breast of the savage Antoine,
who is charmed by the sight of female beauty and protects her when lie had been engaged to murder her.

*'l he Bell Rock," or " I n c h Cape Rock" as it it* more commonly designated by mariner*, is a Sunken Rock,off
the North East Coast of Scotland, and was formerly very dangerous to sailors. T h e Abbots of Aberbrothock,
a religious foundation, standing near the coast, caused a large bell to be erected on the float, near to t h e Rock,
wi as to ring by the agitation of the s e a ; and by this simple means, to indicate to the bewildered seaman, t h e
perilous situation in which h» was placed. There is a tradition current among the inhabitants of the coast, that
the bell was cut from the float, and stolen, and that the person who committed this nefarious action, afterwards
met his fate by shipwreck, on this very rock, during a dark and stormy night. On this tradition the pieee to

a vessel, who asked hi.n if he did not mean to go into the Bay that night, to which, Vanderdecken, with a tremendous oath, replied "he .could not; though he should beat about till the day of judgment."
Vanderdeckvn
never did go into 'Table B a y ; and is believed to undergone the doom he so desperately dared. His veseel is

lake place on board the F L O A T I N G BEACON, a VESSEL stationed off the Coast of Norway, to which Convicts
were transported and condemned perpetually to Trim the Beacon Light, to warn Vessels of the dangerous S.iuds,
Many atrocious actions are said to have taken place in this singular and secluded Situation, particularly one,
subject of this Drama—an English Ship being wrecked, a Native of that Country, having bourne his wife tiur.ttjjh
the Breakers, seeks Protection from the Crew of the Beacon ; the ferocious Captain Murders the Gentleman and
f'oicrs the Lady to become his, and by not suffering the approach of any Strangers, her Existence is unknown to
t- c World. At the commencement of the Piece, Frederick a Youth, who in infancy was preserved from the Waves
it again Shipwrecked, on his passage to England, to seek for his Parents under the Protection of Jack Junk ; he
gams the Beacon, its fierce inmates devote him to destruction, when he is si.ved from present danger by the ingei.nity of Marietta—his fiiend Junk seeking him is attacked by the Knffians, but escaping their danger becomes
imminent, and they resolve to slay their Victim, who is secured in the hold of the Vessel, the Interest now increases
Rlariettc, by means of a bracelet, diecovers Frederick to be her Son, endeavours to effect bis escape, by means of
a seen t pain e l ; they are closely pursued by the Villains, and resolve to throw themselves into the sea, when the
gallant M-aman Junk, and his companions rush on board, audoveicome the assassins. The scene of their atrocities
( l b . Pleating Beacon) is destroved by fire.

Inkle and

Yarico,

W R I T T E N BY GEORGE COLMAN.
This Play was writtcu when the Author was very young ; and, should he live to be very old, he will have
reason to be proud of it to his latest day—for it is one of those Plays which is independent of time, of place, or
of circumstances, for its value. It was popular before the subject of the Abolition of the Slave Trade was popular,
it has the peculiar honour of preceding that great question. It was the bright' forerunner of alleviation to the
hardships of Slavery.
T h e subject of this play is a most interesting one, and in the treatment of it. the Author has shewn taste,
judgment and virtue,—Vide Mrs. Inchbald's Dramatic
Criticism.

Of the Theatre R o u d , Driiry Lane, being- engaged, will make her first tippenrtfWe in
the very prominent Character s>he suhtniiicd in London, with distinguished admiration.

Mr. M A T H E R ,
From the Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, hdng arrived, will make his first appearance this night.
T h e Manager feels it a duty to the Public, to express his thanks fur the support lie has received, throughout
a time ofExtreme discouragement generally, lo Theatrical Amusements, the. great disappointments the Establishmeut had io meet in some principal arrangements, and the unluek'd for and formidable opposition in various usual
aud novel Entertainments introduced upon the Town, The circumstance that the Grand Opera of C I N D E R E L L A
was effectually successful is most gratifying to his endeavours, and that after it being acted 13 Nights it was'
equally attractive to the last, is a solid proof of the approbation bestowed upon the exertions of the Management,
F u r the present it is laid aside, purposely for the introduction of many favourite Plays, in which Actors from the
Metropolitan Boards will occasionally appear in some of their most' favourite eha:acters.

Consisting of Two Leaders and Twenty-five Musicians, who perform on 5 0 to .~>3 Horn*,

" T H E FLYING DUTCHMN, or PHANTOM SHIP,' 1 U said to be an Amsterdam Vessel, which ahont a century a>.
sailed from that port; the master's name was Vandcrdecken, whose constant boast it was, that " At would have hit own way in
ipUe of the Peril "
Once .D doubling the ape, they were a whole day trying to weather Table Bay, the wind increasing a-hcad of them, and
Vanderdecken, walking the deck, continued to swear tearfully. Just after sunset, he was spoke by a vessel, who asked him if he
did not mean to go into the Bay that night, to which, Vanderdecken, with a tremendous oath, replied, " hewould not ; though Ac
iheuld btat about till I hi uau tf judgment." Yaudcrdecken never d id go into Table Bay ; and is believed to undergone the doom
bo *o dtiptratchj dared. His vessel is still seen in the Cape Seas, in foul weather, sailing against the fiercest storm with every
inch of canvass set, striving in vain to reach her home, or to send despatches to relatives by other vessels. The above, ou which
the Drama Is founded, was taken from a short and interesting account in lack wood's Mgazine.

THE LEAR
OF

P r i v a t e Life.
Taken from the popular Tales written by Mrs. Opio, called Father and Daughter*
T h e serious p a r t of this D r a m a is founded on the following h e a r t - r e n d i n g c i r c u m s t a n c e s : — A g n e s
is t h e only child of t h e widowed F i t z a r d s n , who tenderly loving h e r , c e n t r e s all his earthly h a p p i n e s s
in her. I n the fulness of t h a t liberality so peculiarly the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of an E n g l i s h m a n , F l t z b a r d e n
founds a L u n a t i c A s j l u t n . A g n e s is shortly after lured by the base s t r a t a g e m of a d e s i g n i n g villain.
T h e sensitive mind of h e r f a t h e r fails at the loss of his d a u g h t e r , and his reason becomes overturned*
After many severe trials and afflictions, she eventually becomes a domestic in the very L u n a t i c A s y l u m
established by her o w n b r o k e n - h e a r t e d a n d aged p a r e n t , a n d to which h e r conduct had driven him.—

This romantic Drama is a tale of crime, sorrow and remorse ; the heio and heroine, the once gay Mark Redland, (TJurdnck

I . e o m D i c x i o n stuined,' their hair dyed: the miserable tenants of a wretched hotel, hearing the semblance of an Inn, to lure
H**f , , n w a J V traveller to plunder and outrage. The first cii ne of Hose, was disobedience; her father to retrieve a mined fortune,
fa, i ionrneved to a far countrv, leaving his daughter in the caru of an old friend—in defiance of duly, she uianicd his bitterest
? *• the man who had robbed him, and who (though she knew it not) was an outlaw, and a felon—and Uose becomes the passive
l o e n t o f her husband's crimes the sharer of his contidf nee and guilt, without having lifted the dagger against the defeuceleaa
atr«i-er
Murdock is the chief of a gang of coiners, among w horn is Sawney Macfile, whose vocation is that of a guide, to deeo' " S victim, to the Fox and Gooie.—Travellers are on the road ; one, a stranger returning to his native village after a long

filtheVl 'Filial pletv induces her to resort to various expedient! for his safety—diaws the pistols with which they intend to perpetrate the • o r d e r — Murdoek snaps the unloaded pistol—shots are fired tiom without—the robbers have fallen, and the gratefal

OUTLINE OP T H E STORY:
1IM>I II AM. the celebrated East Indian Conqueror, lather to Tippoo Saih,
Inning overran the Mysore and Oorotnandal territories) and defeated the MahrnttOS, attacked and entered upon the domains of the Nabob of Bangalore, whose
force* he roated in several battles, end finally possessing himself of his capital,
the Nabob was depoeed and, with his family, baniahed; whilst In resentment of
his son, Badbnaing > «,ob*tinate reaittaiiee to his encroachments, the tyrant caused
his tongue to be torne om, and himself to be driven a helpless mutilated wanderer into die woods. It here chanced that he one day encountered a Lion,
• h o instead of exhibiting his natural ferocity, ulteiedpitious cries of complaint,
Inoffensive]] leading the way to a retired part of the forest, where Sadhusing
found a Hounded Lioness lying in greet agony : humanity supported by courage
Induced hitn to succour the anguished b r u t e ; he extracted <he broken fragment
of the weapon and, by bis knowledge of plants, assuaged her torture, and healed
the injury. From tliis period, the lord of the woods and his mate, with a gratitude of which their natures would scarcely have been supposed susceptible, became the attached friends and subservient creature..of their benefactor. Meantime the Nabob Zo/amba ami Ids wife Mora, never abandoning the hope that
some change of fortune might precipitate the tyianl from, the throne he had so
unjustly usurped, had joined a tribe of wandering Pariars, a degraded tribe of
Indians, much oppressed by the tyiant, and, indeed, scorned by the Hindoos
generally, bat who entered cordially into Yozamha's plans of vengeance; and
in the woods to which Hydcr's power and general abhorrence had driven them,
Unceasingly plotted the means of restoring their leader to empire. Delhi, the
daughter of Zo/am!.a and Mora, lister of Sadhusing, Hydcr had retained as a
prisoner in his palace, where, enamoured of her beauty, he incessantly persecuted bet with his addresses, which she as persexeringly rejected. In the hope
D| obtaining some communication with his child, and perhaps even of rescuing
her from confinement, Zoaatnba had penetrated into the interior of the tyrant's
palace; .here,being soon detected, the tyrant's myrmidons would have made
ipiick end of his sutieiings, had not Hyder himself arrived, who recognizing
his ancient enemy and rival, and stung by his taunts, enter into single anil eijual
Combat with him. This is intenopted by the sudden appearance of Delhi, who
recognises her father's voice, and in agony of apprehension implores him to
< \pose himself no further to the tyrant's cruelty. He is now, by llydcr'sorder,

dragged to a dungeon, and his hie is proclaimed to depend on the compliance
o| Delhi with the tyrant's will. Mora had, at the same time, hovered about the
palace, with a considerable tribe of Pariars, for the purpose of assisting the object oilier husband ; but recognized by the guards and household as a Pariar,
she is hunted by them, in the design of putting her to death, into the very prcsi nee of her daughter, whose power, as the intended bride of the Sultan, affords
Bar a momentary protection. The mob, however, and royal guards, knowing
that a being so degraded had dared to profane the palace, insist on their victim,
whom they ale about to immolate, when the whole body of'Pairiars, privatelyintroduced into the palace by a good-natured English Buffoon, whom the tyrant retains lor his amusement, rush in, and succeed in snatching Mora from the
destruction which threatens her; the same body in their retreat force the dungeon of Zozamba, and again restore him to liberty. The exiled family and the
Parian are, in their ret'eat, deploring the ill success of their efforts, when the
s
• good-natured Englishman arrives, and informs them that the tyrant has
appointed n grand hunt in the Valley of the Pelicans, where a skilful ambush
and a determined attack, may again change the face of affairs. This revives
their drooping hopes, and animates them once more to resistance. Pursued,
however, to their woodland recesses by the tyrant's troops, Sndhusing is about
to fall a victim to their overwhelming numbers, when his assailants are repelled
by his friends, the l.ion and Lioness, who resolutely defend him, and keep a
whole best ol his enemies at bay. 'I he grand hunt takes place ; the Parian
present themselves to dislodge the game, their services are accepted, and at the
proper momentZoanmba, supported by his friends, renews his attack on the
tyrant's person, who is surrounded by all the pomp and splendour of his court;
a desperate conflict takes place fortune is still adverse to the Parian, they are
defeated, and Zozamba, Mora, and Sadhusing all become Hyder's prisoners.—
He commands their attendance in the great Arena of Mysore, there to be devoured by the wild animals which form part ot the appendage to his household. In
vain does Zozatnba implore to perish first, in vain do Mora, and even Delhi, on
iheii knees entreat for mercy. Sadhusing is selected as the first victim l o b e
cast into the den of the ferocious monster, then roaring foith his note of terror
and destruction. All that can be obtained of Hyder is that Sadhusingshall be
aimed, and have the privilege of contending for his life with the fierce majsttj
of he,sis. In sight of his agonized relatives, and of the assembled tribes, he is
armed only with a light javelin, east into the den, when a furious combat takes
[dace with the I,ion, characterized by all (hat valour and picturesque hazard incurred in the ci Limited contests ol a similar nature which occurred in the amphitheatres ol Imperial Home, 'ihc braver] of Sadhusing, assisted by his
intimate knew It dge ol l lie bah its ol the animal, prevail, and the Lion Is entirely
tubdued. Thl
iredly one of the most interesting and Impressive sitae*
lions and egeets ever exhibited In a Theatre, In • transport of admiration,
fiydei not only forgives Sadhusing and his parents, but restores them to their
dominions on condition of receiving Delhi's hand, who, overcome by Uu* geiii'iiiMiv, HO longer opposes his wishes. All is now joy, and the triumph is
celebrated l>\ one ol thosi \.-.-t Pageant- of Oriental p o m p and grandeur,
which con scarce!) he conceived, mid never was so brilliantly realised as iu this
unequalled spectacle.

Ar*nA«»!f«.

T h e sea ! the sea ! the open sea !
T h e blue, the fresh, the ever free.
Without a mark, without a bound,—
It runneth the earth's wide regions round,
It plays « ilh the-elouda, it. mocks the. skies,
Or like a cradled creature lies.
I'm on the sea ! I'm on the sea !
I am where I would ever he j
With the blue above, and the blue below,
And silence wheresoe'er I go.
If a storm should come and awake the deep,
What matter,—I shall ride and sleep.
1 love—O how I love to ride
On the fierce, foaming, tide!
* VOJ
When ev'ry mad wave drowns the moon,
Or whistles aloft its tempest t u n e ;
And tells how goeth the world below,
And why the sou'west blast doth blow.
I never was on tho dull tarns shore,
But I lov'd t h e great sea more and more,
And backwards flew to her billowy breast,
Like a bird that seeketh its mother's nest;
And a mother «hc was and is to me,
For I was .born on the open sen.
T h e waves were white, and r e d t h e m o r h ,
In the noisv hour when I was born ;
And the whale it whistled, the porpoise Tolled,
And the dolphins bored thei* hacks of gold;
And never was lieard such an outcry wjkL,
As welcom'd to lifts the ocean child*
1 have lived siucc then in calm and stride,
Full fifty summers a rover's life

for another victim whom he may sacrifice upon the ultar of the Damon of the Red Sea, when Sindbad falls in his power; at this period the Pantomime commences, and Sindhad is discovered sleeping, and awakes just in time to be too late, for he perceives the

programme of tt)e principal Inciomts.
The Wizard Oceano, surnamed the Old Man of the Sea, having sworn to the Diemon of the Red Sea, to immolate a human victim upon his altar, at everv change of the Moon, is thereby enabled to subdue Parazaide, the Fairy of the G olden Islands ; and
confining her for ever in a'crystal vase, reigns undisputed Lord of the Island, practising every cruelty upon the unfortunate travellers who land upon its shores. An English vessel is wi ecked upon the Island, and all on board perish, with the exception of
Marian, who falls into the Wizard's power.—Enamoured of the Girl, Oceano wishes to preserve her lite, and is anxiously seeking
for another victim whom he may sacrifice upon the altar of the Daemon of the 1'ed Sea, when Sindbad falls in his power ; at this period the Pantomime commences, and Sindbad is discovered sleeping, and awakes .just in time to be too late, for he perceives the
vessel in which he had visited the fatal coast, leaving the Island. Abandoned by his companions, the unlucky mariner falls into the
power of Oceano, and is led to
T H E MYSTIC C A V E R N OP T H E OLD M A N O P T H E
SEA.
Here the Wizard, aided by the Monster Malico, chains the unhappy Sinbad to a rock, and is endeavouring to prevail upon the
captive Marian to listen to his suit, when he is reminded by
T H E DiEMON OP T H E CRIMSON SEA,
That the moment approaches when he BUM render up the itlpulated victim, or the Fairy Para/aide will regain her liberty.
Oceano determines that Sinclhad sliall pwiaO | hut i'ailing in his foul design
T H E PAIRY OP T H E GOLDEN ISLAND ESCAPES FROM T H E MAGIC VASE,
And transforming the Unhappy prisoners into the motl.1 Hero and Heroine of Pantomime, aids their escape than the Enchanted
Island. The Damon of the lied Sea, reluctant to lose his victims, changes Oceano and MuicO, int. the slippered Pantaloon and
fantastic Clown, dispatching them in pursuit of the Lovers.—the view holloa is given—the game started—and Harlequin breaking
cover, runs his annual round through the following

Thin Drama will be found to display a powerful, >ct correct pictttre of Humble Life, ut once rejecting; the speculative and ideal ; it will combine Characflind Scene* a*they really exist in the World, casting a vivid and faithful reflection of the manners of that portion of societyj which it is in tho present attempt,

" The highest Public intircst, is only made up at last, of what interests all privately."
wis he true, the present effort will, it il hoped, he found particularly worthy the attention of the Drama's Patrons, who will discover in " t h e short and simple
ul» of the poor" Maid Servant, events, feelings, and afl'ei (ions of the highest importance, of the dearest and most absorbing interest. One of the characteris of the apirit of tho ngc, is the decline of that fastidiousness which was wont to vote all things essentially vulgar in Society, that wero necessarily humble.
ippily wo now recognize true dignity in human nature itself, and not in its artificial modifications, in its cumbrous and imposing trappings. The human heart
iproved too much for the " Fashion-monger*." In the present Drama, personages will be introduced of a coarse and reckless nature, only in contrast to more

Stealthy Burglar—the Hypocritical and Srljish I'surer—(he Recless Tyro in Crime—and Confirmed and Wrinkled Piatt
Jef whom are anatomised to warn and disgust, and not falsely arrayed to intoxicate and allure. In short the Drama will represent Characters and events, to
'ifwmd in everg day of life, in the English Metropolis ; it is hoped, it will prove a copy, not a distortion of human nature ; and, although it is not presumed to
jjtaw Martha Willis aa a rival Heroine to the crowned and regally invested creations of lofty Tragedy, and it is trusted, that her story will not bo declared deist, either in dramatic or moral interest. Humility of station it will be remembered, cannot lesson innate worth. The Poet has beautifully described the

This Drama will be found to display a powerful, yet cornel pit line of Humble Life, at once rejecting- the speculative and ideal ; it will combina Charac<«i md Scenes as they really exist in the world, casting a \ i\ id and faithful reflection of the manners of that portion of society, which it is in the present attempt,

If this be true, the present effort will, it h hoped, be (bund particularly worthy the attention of the Drama's Patrons, who will discover in ** the short and simple

the popular Mala Drama of

Martha Willis9
*•"

MAID-SERVANT.

'1 hisl'mni. will bf totirtcl to display a powerful, yet corr.et picture of Humble Life, at once rejecting the speculative and ideal; it will combine Character
>itti Scenes as they teally exist in the world. casimx a vivid and faithful tefluctiou of tue mannert of that portion of society, which It i> in the pis-seat attempt, iuieutUct
.rcalUrly so illustrate. An enllgltteiieii Critic of the present day has said ;
" T h e h i g h e s t P u b l i c Interest, is only m a d e u p a t last, of w h a t interests all p r i v a t e l y . "
IT this be true, the present effort will, it is hived, he found particularly worthy the nltenlion of the Diuinu's Patrons, who will discover in 'the short & simple annals of the
isoor" Maid Bar-ant, events, feelings, and atiVetioiis of the highest importance, of the dearest and most absorbing interest. Our of the characteristics of the spirit of the
a«e, is the decline of that fa.ttdlotl.nOM which was wont to »ote all things essentially vulgar in Society, that were ni eessarlly humble. Happily we now recognize true
dignity in human natiiri Itself, and not in its artificial modifications, in its cuiniiious mid imposing ttappings. The human heart has proved too much for the " Fashionaton-eis." In the pr.t.nt Drama, personages will be iiittoduced of a coarse and reckless untuie, only in contrast 10 more delicate and amiable delineation. There wilt
•OMtsarlly be a vatiety, but the good will oppose and chame the bad; thus displayed, it Moral may be gamed fiom tlio

All .f whom aie uuatriiiised to watn and disgust, and not falsely arrayed to Intoxicate and allure. In short tho Drama will represent Characters and events, to be
fo ind in everv dlj ol life, In the Kuglikh Metio^iolis ; it is hoped, it will 'prove a nop)
t a distortion of liiiiiiuu nature , and, although it is not presumed to advane.
