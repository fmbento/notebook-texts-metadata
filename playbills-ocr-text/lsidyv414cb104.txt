OUTLINE O r l r H B TRAGEDY OF ANTIGONE:Eteocles and Polynicet, the sons of /Edipus, King- of Thebes, agreed to reign alternately'. Eft-odes, having grasped the sceptre, determined
to retain it. Pelymc** ptwetired the aid of his f.ither<i«-lnvr, the King of Argon, to enforce his right. An Argive army besieged Thebes; it was
defeated; a-nd the brothers, encountering «n battle, fell by each other's hand. Creon, their nearest male relative, immediately ascended the
tin one, and foi'bade the rites of sepulchre to the body «f Polynices, Antigone, animated by piety and sisterly love, nobly dares to break the
tyrant's mandate. She was detected in the attempt to inter her brother, and was conveyed to «lie by incarceration in the cavern of a rock.
'I'iresias, the blind seer, prophetically announcing the sequent ills of this unjust sentence, induces Creon to burv Polynices, and release Antigone.
He infers the corse, and hastens te the cavern, but too late t» avert the torments of a lingering death—Antigone had strangled herself. H i
lover, his son Honwon, was there discovered, lamenting Iter untimely end. The youth destroys himself Eurydice, his mother, dies dtstra -*d A>r
her loss, plunges a fatal weapon into her boson and expires. The Tragedy concludes by the self-reproaches of IJreon. The Chorus consists of
Nobles and Councillors of Thebes, who are assembled -before the Palace of Creon, to hear the tyrannic decree which proved so fatal to his family.
In the ancient Greek Theatre the sewne was fixed, and was used for all plays indiscriminately. In order to point out to the audience the
relative positions of the actors, they entered and left the stage by the same door. The king, or principal actor, only entered by the centre, called
the royal door. Tfee second character by a smaller door on the right hand side, and the third characters by a small door on the left. At the
extremities of One scenes were two doors* that on toe right leading to the ritv, through which citizens, &c, entered; and that on the left leading
to the country, for strangers and messengers. The choruses, orchestra, bacclwnuls, fcc, were below the stage. The Greek play having been
written with s view to this arrangement, the ancient Greek mode has been adhered to in the present instance as far as it was practicable.

A N T I G O N E : Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of (Ed i pus, Kingr of Thebes, agreed to reign alternately. Kteocles, having1 grasped ilie sreptre. determined
>tain it. Polynices procured the aid of his father-in-law, the Kitiif of Ar-?a*, to enforce his rtjrht. An Arrive army be-siejfed Thehes- it was
to retaJ
tted- and the brothers, encountering in buttle, felt bv each oilier'-* hand. (Jreon, their nearest male relative, immediately ascended the
throne, and forbade the rites of sepultitie to the body of f-otynices. Antigone, animated by piety and sisterly lore, nobly darrd to break the
tyrant's mandate. She Was detected in the attempt to inter 'her brother, and was conveyed to die by incarceration in the cavern of a rock.
Tiresias, the blind seer, prophetically announcing the sequent ills of this unjust sentence, indue*'. Oeon'to bury Polyiiices, and release Anligo'H'.
He inters the corse, and hastens to the cavern, but too fate to avert the torments of a lingering death -~-.Antigti.ie had strangled herself. Her
lover, his son Harmon, was there discovered, lamenting her untimely end. The youth destroys himself. Enrydice, his mother, dies distracted
for her loss, plunge*, a fatal weapon in her bosom ami expires. The Tragedy concludes by the self-reproaches of Creon. The Chorus p-nsjals
of Nobles and Councillors of Thebes, who are assembled before the Palace of Creoti, to hear tl>e tyrannic decree which proved so fatal to his family.
In the ancient Oreek Theatre the scene was fixed, and was used for all play* indiscriminately. In order to point out to the audience the
relative positions of the actors, they entered and left the t-tajre by the same door. * The king, or principal actor, only entered by the centre, called
the royal door. The second character by a smaller dour on the right hand side, and the third characters by a small door oil the left. At the
extremities of the scenes were two doors; that on the right leading to the city, through which citizens., ike,, entered ; and that on the left leading
to the country, for strangers and messengers. The choruses, orchestra, bacchanals, ike, were below the stage. The Greek play having been
written with a view to this arrangement, the ancient Greek mode* has been adhered to in the present instance as far as it was practicable.

'

The Dancing of tlio inimitable Group of Viennese Children is never ceasing in nieasare-giving sensations. If imagination could take it*
. and picture the Fairy Halls of Oheron, where the Elfin Conrt held high festival, and Sprites, born of the moon-beam,,footedit to the
of .Eolean Harps, we"could scarcely paint a scene more Fairy-like than the Ball-room of these Figurantes. The world need not despair
cessor* to the present popular Nymphs of the 'Twinkling Feet,' we could detect the embryo grace of a Tagiicni, and the bounding curvette
crito, amon.rst these accomplished Children."—Hirmingkam

John P e o r y b i n g l . ( t h e Carrier)
Mr. L Y N N E
'• That lumbering, slow, honest John : that John m heavy, but so light of spirit; so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the cor*; se
dull without, .0 quick within; so stolid, but so good."
Tackleton ( t h e Toy M a k e r )
....Mr. B A R R Y
" He didn't look much like a Bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier's Kitchen, with a twist in his dry face and a screw in his body, and his
hat jerked ever the bridge of his nose, mid his hands stuck down into ihe bottoms of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self
peering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number of ravens."
Caleb Pltimmer (bis Man)
.........Mr ARTAUD
" A meagre, thoughtful, dirty-faced man, who seemed to hsv* made himself a great coat from the sack-cloth covering of some old box;
lot when be turned to shut the door, he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription C and T in large black capitals."
The Stranger
Mr. C H U T E
u
His garb was very quaint and odd—along, long way behind the time. He had long white hair; good features, singularly bold and well
defined for an old man; and dark, bright penetratingeyes."
Mrs. Peerybingle (familiarly known as " D O T " ) — . . . M i s . M A C R E A D Y
" Fair.be was, and young—.though something of iviiat is called the dumpling shape; but I don't myself object to that."
Bertha ( C a l e b Plummer's Blind Child)
Mis. DAWSON
" She and her father lived all alone by themselves, as the Story Books say—and my blessing : with yours to back it, I hope I on the Story
Books, for saying anything in this workaday world."
May Fielding
Miss M A R 8 T O N
"Tackletou was a man of taste beyond all question. May wsa very pretty."
Mrs. Fielding (her Mother)
.......Mrs. W . H. ANGEL
An old lady with a peevish face, who was very genteel and patronizing. The majestic old soul had adorned herself with a cap calculated
ta inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe,' r
Tilly Slowboy (a Foundling)
Mrs. B A R R E T T
" T h e maternal and paternal Siowboy wer. alike unknown to fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity a Foundling; which word,
though differing only from Fondling hv on. vowel's length, is very different in meaning, and expresses quite another thing."

A SONG, B Y MR. C R A N T Z .
To conclude wilh (.fourth time here) an ENTIRELY NEW DRAMA, by T. ARCHER, Esq., called

THE VIOLETt
NAPOLEON'S F L O W E R .

The incidents in this Drama actually occurred during, or soon after, the memorable " Hundred Day.." Napoleon', favorite
flower and rallying sign to hi. friends was the Violet: beneath the leaves of the flower was concealed a Head of Napoleon.
On the course of the Seine, as well as on the Lake of Geneva, the Violet was the secret symbol by which the friends of Napoleon
denoted their Chief, and recognized each other. Rings of a violet colour, with the device, " It will re-apptar in the Spring,"
became fashionable. The ladies were dres,ed in violet-coloured silks, and the men displayed violet-coloured watch strings.
^ h e n they asked, " Are you fond of the Violet t" if the answer was simply " yes," it was inferred the respondent was not a
confederate; but if he replied, " Very well," he recognised a brother initiated in the Secret of the Conspiracy, and completed
the sentence by remarking, *• It will re-appear t'n the Spring."

APPROPRIATE SCENERY, MACHINERY, AND
APPOINTMENTS.
John Peerybingle (the Carrier)
Mr. L Y N N E
•' That lumbering, .low, boned John : that John .0 heavy, but io light of .pirit; «o rough ujwn the surface, but so geatl. at the eor.; to
dull without, HI quick within ; <o itolid, but >o good."
Tackleton ( t h e Toy Maker)
Mr. BARRY
" He didn't look much like . Bridegroom, a, he »iooi! in the Carrier Kitchen, with it twist i . hi. dry f.ic» and . srrew in hi. body, and hi,
hat jerked over th< bridge of his nose, and hi. hand, .tuck down into the hottoma ot hi. pockets, and hi. whole ( o r o t i c ill-conditionad self
pe.riag out of one little eorner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number of raveu.,"
Caleb Plummer (his Man)
Mr. ARTAUD
- A meagre, thoughtful, dirty-faced man, who teemed to have made himself a great coat from the sack-cloth covering of tome old box;
for when ha turned to .hut the door, he di.clo.ed upon the bark of thai garment the inscription C and T in large black capital,."
T h e Stranger
Mr. C H U T E
" H i t garb w»« very qnaint and odd—a long, long way behind the time. He had long white hairj good feature., singularly bold and well
define., for an old man; and dark, bright penetrating eyes."
Mrs. Peerybingle (familiarly known as " D O T " )
Miss M A C R E A D Y
" Fair she was, and young—though something of what is called the dumpling shape ; but I don't myself object to that."
Bertha (Caleb Plumnier's Blind Child)
Miss D A W S O N
M
She and her father lived all alone by themselves, as the Story Books say—and my blessing: with yours to back it, I hope: oa the Stoiy

" TacVlelon was a man of taste beyond all question. May was very pretty."
Mrs. Fielding (ber Mothor)
Mrs. W . H. A N G E L
"An old lady with a peevish fare, who was very genteel and patronizing. The majest;c old soul had adorned herself v.nh a cap calculate
toinspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe."
Tilly Slowboy (a Foundling)
Mrs. B A R R E T T
" The maternal and paternal Siowboy wer. alike unknown to fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity e Foundling; which word,
though differing only from Fondling by one vowel's length, is very different in meaning, and expresses quite another thing."
Dot's Father and Mother

LAST NIGHT BUT TWO OF THE CELEBRATED

African Rosctus
A NATIVE OF SENEGAL, WESTERN AFRICA,

OF THE THEATRE-ROYAL COVENT GARDEN.
T h e singular Novelty of a Native African personating Dramatic Characters, has excited a degree of interest unparalleled in
t h e annals of the Stage, and the African's Performances have every where been received with enthusiasm. T h e greatest success has attended his efforts in London, Dublin, Edinburg-h, Liverpool, &c.
As the African Roseius is the only Actor of-Colour that was ever known, and probably the only instance that may occur, and having been
acknow)edged by the Press of England, Ireland, and Scotland, to possess histrionic talent of the highest order, the following sketch of his lit*
way not be unacceptable.—
The African's progenitors, down to thr* Grandfather of the subject of this memoir, were Princes of the r*oala!i Tribe, whose dominions were
Senegal, on the banks of the river of that name. The Father of the present indmdual was sent for his education to Schenectady College, near
New York, in the United States. Three days after hi* departure from his native shore, an insurrection broke out among the tribe, arising
chiefly from a wish on the part of their King, to exchange prisoners taken in battle, instead of adopting the usual birbaroas custom of selling
them for slaves. His humanity, however, interfered with an established perquisite Ion*- possessed by some of his prtnrip.il officers. The Grandfather of the present African Rosciua, through their interested policy, fell a victim to his mutinous subjects. Deprived of the means of asserting
bis birthright, and to a certain degree cast upon the world as a cosmopolite, the father became a clergyman, and ofikin-.ee in New York. Tno
subject of this memoir was born July 24th, 1HO7, and was destined for the same profession - but preferring the sock and buskin, he departed,
from his father's roof, and wended his way to the shores of Old England.

<A Native of SENEGAL, WESTERN AFRICA,)
OF THE THEATRE-ROYAL COVENT GARDEN,
The singular Novelty of. Native African personating Dramatic Characters, has excited a degree of interest unparalleled in
the annals ef the Stage, and the African'. Performances have every where bee. received with enthusiasm. The greatest success has attended bis efforts t . London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Liverpool, &c.
A. the African Koscius is the only Actor of Colour that was ever known, and probably the only instance that may occur, and having been
acknowledged by the Kress of England, lrelaad, and .Scotland, to possess histrionic talent of the highest order, the following sketch of nit life
«nay -not be unacceptable:—
The African's progenitors, down to the Grandfather of the subject .f this Memoir, were Princes of the Foalah Tribe, whose dominions were
Senegal, a* the banks ef the river of that name. The Father of the present individual was tent for his education to Schenectady College, near
New York, in the United States. Three days after hU departure from his native shore, an insurrection broke out among the tribe, arising
chiefly from a wish on the part of their King, to exchange prisoners taken in battle, instead of adopting the usual barbarous costom of selling
them for slaves. His humanity, however, interfered with an established perquisite long possessed by some of his principal officers. The Grandfather of the present African Roscras, through their interested policy, fell a victim to his mutinous subjects. Deprived of the means of asserting
his birthright, and to a certain degree cast upon the world as a cosmopolite, the father became a clergyman, and officiates in Naw York. The
subject of this memoir was born July 24th, 1807, and was destined for the same profession ; but preferring the sock and buskin, he departed
from Tut father'sroof,and wended fds way to the shores of Old England.

FORESTof BONDY;
Or j The i*o<f of JflTontarffis /

The French Historians place, about the year 1373, the Tale of Aubri de Montdidier, which, so strange as it is, is sufficiently
authentic to merit record. He was murdered in the wood of Bondy, and buried under a tree- His faithful dog, after waiting
at hi. grave till near.} famished, repaired lo Paris, and sought out his late master's dearest friend.
His hunger being satisfied, be contrived so many gestures of anxiety (together with the non-appearance of his master, Capt.
Aubri), that they tempted the friend to follow the anxious animal to the fatal wood, where, by scratching on the grave, the
murdered body was discovered. This was not enough for the sagacious dog. It was not long before he fixed on the Assassin
of his Master. This was the Chevalier Macaire—him the faithful beast pursued with unrelenting ferocity—he persecuted him
wherever he went, and pointed h,m out amidst crowds of courtiers, by never-ceasing anxiety to destroy him. Macaire had been
known as the professed foe of Aubri; and this circumstance, joined to the dog's preternatural perseverance, tempted the King
to allow him the combat. This singular duel was fought In the Isle of Notre Dame, at Paris; and to render the Champions
more equal, a staff only was allowed to Macaire, while the dog had a tub as a place ot retreat. This he managed to so much
advantage, and so much annoyed his adversary by sallying and retiring, that at length the Chevalier fainted, and the victorious
brute wised him by the throat;—Macaire acknowledged the murder, and suffered the merited punishment. The Sculpture
relating the story is preserved at the Castle of Montargis.

Illustrated

by 39 Moveable

T h e object of the Lecturer is to diffuse knowledge, to impart as much crtindensed information as could be obtained by considerable
study, to abolish scepticism and infidelity, and to lead the mind through Nature " u p to Nature's God.''
The Apparatus used in Illustration of these L E C T U R E S and E X H I B I T I O N , is of the most splendid and costly description, being
on a scale of magnificence never before introduced into Bath—calculated to blend instruction with amusement—to gratify the learned
and the unlearned—refresh the memory of the scholar—and afford the general auditor a magnificent display. The Lecture and Exhibition have been received with high approval at Edinburgh, Dublin, Birmingham, Bristol, and the principal cities in the empire, under
the patronage of Bishops at several Catholic Colleges, and high Educational Establishments. Certificates may be seen at the Box Office.

John Peer-bin^e (tbe Carrier)
Mr. LYNNE
" That lumbering, .low, honeat John: that John so heavy, but so light of spirit; ao rongh upon tbe surface, but ao gentle at t.«e aire; *>

- He didn't look much like a Bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier's Kitchen, with a twiat in Ms drjr face and a .crew in Ilia body, and iii.
hat jerked over the bridge of his nose, and hi. hands .tuck down into the bottom, of his pockets, and hi. whole sarcastic i).*eonditiontd aelf

A meagre, thoughtful* dilty-faced man, who .seemed to-hare made himself a great coat from tbe sack-cloth covering of some old box ;
lor when he turned to shut the door, he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription C and T in large black capitals."

Tbe Stranger

Mr. KINGSTON

'* His garb was rery quaint ar.d odd—a long, long way behind the time. He had long white hair ; good feature., singularly bold and wall
defined for an old man; and dark, bright penetrating eyes.''
Mrs. Peerybingle (familiarly known is " DOT")

" fair she was, and young—though something of what is called the dumpling shape; but I don't myself object to that."
Bertha (Caleb Plummer's Blind Child)

T H E VIOLET,
NAPOLEON'S FLOWER.

*

The incidents in this Drama actually occurred during, or soon after, tbe memorable - Hundred Days." Napoleon's favorite
flower and rallying sign to his friends was tbe Violet; beneath the leaves of the flower was concealed a Head ol Napoleon.
On tbe course of the Seine, as well as on the Lake of Genera, the Violet was the secret symbol by which the friends of Napoleon
denoted their Chief, and recognized each other. Rings of a violet colour, with tbe device, " It will re-appear in the Spring,"
became fashionable. The ladies were dressed in violet-coloured silks, and tbe men displayed violet-coloured watch ufSKEgs.
When they asked, " Are yoit fond of the Violet t" if the answer was simply " yes," it was inferred the respondent wa, not a
confederate; but if he replied, " Very," he recognized a brother initiated in tbe Secret of the Conspiracy, and completes, the
sentence by remarking, " It will re-appear in the Spring."

The English Tom Thumb has already appeared before the Nobility at the Egyptian Hall, London ; and at the Royal
Surrey T h e a t r e ; at the Theatres-Royal—Brighton, Plymouth, Devonport, &c. Sec.; and before numerous assemblages at Tavistock, Dawlish, Teignmouth, Torquay, Taunton, Bridgwater, &c. &c.; and so late as Saturday, March
28, before the Noblemen and Gentlemen of the Oxford Universities nt Oxford, by whom he was invested with cap and
gown of M.A., and so unanimous and cheering was the reception which the little Englishman met with, from the
members of this learned body, that his success in Oxford is pronounced to be the most brilliant ever achieved.
Wherever the English Tom Thumb (who is a native of Kittisford, in Somersetshire, and who is 16 years of age)
has appeared, he has been hailed with the greatest applause. Though diminutive in stature, he is great in intellect—
a clever actor—an artistic dancer—and a talented singer. Sir JAMES
CLARK and Dr. LOCOCK, Her
Majesty's
Physicians, have pronounced hitn the most symmetrical Dwarf in the world. T h e Public Press, without exception, has
spoken in the highest term, of his appearance and performances—a few extract, from which are subjoined.

OP1JVIONS OF THE PUBLIC

PRESS.

" The English Tom Thumb may justly be considered one of the greatest curiosities ever beheld."—Morning Post,
" A dwarf, fifty times more genuine, and a hundred times cleverer than Tom Thumb, has appeared in London. He i. not a
•tunted child, but a bona fide mannikin. His singing ' The Fine Old English Gentleman,' is a rich treat."—English Gentleman.
" The new dwarf appeals to our national sympathies, tor he is of English birth. Unlike most dwarfs, he is not misshaped, but
is a handsome symmetrical miniature of the human form."—Britannia.
" The English Tom Thumb altogether eclipses his American predecessor in intellectual power."—Pictorial Timet.
" Field Marshal Tom Thumb appeared at the Surrey Theatre last night, for a benefit in aid of the Jewish charity; the house
was crowded to the ceiling, and the applause was immense. He is 16 years of age, and is only 34 inches in height"— Bell's Life.
" Field Marshal Tom Thumb entered this city yesterday, in a carriage and four. Anything more rare could scarcely have been
brought from the back settlement,."—Trewman's Exeter Flying Post.
"This lilliputian, who is 10 years of age, is a perfect multum %nparvo."—Plymouth and Devonport Weekly Journal.
To conclude with a Domestic Drama, of intense interest, as played with immense success at all the English and American
Theatres, entitled

S I R R O G E R D E C O V E R L E Y , g^g 'The Old English Gentleman:
The English Tom Thumb has already appeared before the Nobility at the Egyptian Hall, London : and at the Royal
Surrey T h e a t r e : at the Theatres-Royal—Brighton, Plymouth, Devonport, &c. & c ; and before numerons assemblages at Tavistock, Dawlish, Teignmoutli, Torquay, Taunton, Bridgwater, &c. <Xrc.; and so late as Saturday, March
28, before the Noblemen and Gentlemen of the Oxford Universities at Oxford, by whom he was invested with cap and
gown of M.A., and so unanimous and cheering v as the reception which the little Englishman met with, from the
members of this learned body, that his success in Oxford is pronounced to be the most brilliant ever achieved.
Wherevei the English Tom Thumb (who is a native of Kittisford, in Somersetshire, and who is 16 years of age)
has appeared, he has been hailed with the greatest applause. Though diminutive in stature, he is great in intellect—
a clever actor—an artistic dancer—and a talented singer. Sir JAMES
CLKBK and Dr. LOCOCK, Her Majesty's
Physicians, have pronounced him the most symmetrical Dwarf in the world. The Public Press, without exception, has
spoken in the highest terms of his appearance and performances—a few extracts from which are subjoined.

"Mademoiselle FLORA FABBRI made her debut before a Liverpool public on Monday evening, and very great wen the
expectations the excited ; yet great as these were, theyfellrery short of the reality. She o'ertopt all her compeers. The only
on* who would stand a moment's comparison with her is Elssler ; and this, we think, would be more from that extreme
bewitchment which hovers round the fascinating Fanny, than from any decided superiority in her art. Every Pat, every
Pose, every Pirouette of Mademoiselle Fabbri is new ; and so wonderful are some of these, that she seems to be a creature
hovering between earth and air, disdaining to touch the former. The grace of her Poses it would be impossible to describe;
each is a study in itself. She is certainly the most bewitching Danseuse it has ever been our happiness to see, and we almost
regret having seen her, for wc are afraid she has rendered us over fastidious, and if so, there is one of our pleasures taken
from us Mademoiselle Fabbri is also an excellent Pantomimist, and her naive acting in the scene, where she is transformed
into the Countess, and finds herself encumbered with trains and all the paraphernalia of a fine lady, was natural, comic, and
perfect. She has been received each night with unbounded enthusiasm, and has turned the heads of both old and young.
" Mademoiselle LOUISE has achieved a great triumph in her part of the lermagent Countess. The character totally
depends upon the Pantomimic powers of the Artiste. So perfect was Mademoiselle Louise in this respect that words would
have been an extra, for which there was not the slightest necessity She could not possibly have been excelled by that Queen of
Pantomimists, Elssler. Mr. PAYNE quite acted up to her; nothing could have been better than hit whole enactment of the
character, Mazourki; for, like Louise's, it all depended upon Pantomime.
" ADELE had little to do, but that little was done with that graceful, fairy-like motion that has made her such a favourite. Mrs. and Miss PAYNE have been a very great acquisition to the Ballet ,• the latter, though very young, it a most successful votary of the Terpsichorean art. The R1DG WA YS most cleverly and ably assisted.
•• Monsieur BRETIN is the finest male dancer who has ever been in Liverpool, and few could imagine that so much
grace could be given to mule dancing."—Liverpool

FIRST APPEARANCE THIS SEASON
OF THE CELEBRATED

AFRICAN ROSCIUS
W H O 18 E N G A G E D

FOR

T H R E E N I G H T S ONLY.
THE AFRICAN KOSC'ICS is the only Actor of colour that was ever known, and probably the only instance that may occur; and havingbeen acknowledged by the Press of England, Ireland, and Scotland lo possess histrionic talent of the highest order, the following- Sketch of hi*
Life may not be unrtcceptahle :—*' The African's progenitor*, down to the Grandfather of the subject of this memoir, were Princes of the Foulah
tribe, whose dominion* were Senegal, on the banks of the river of that name. The Father of the present individual was sent for his education
to Schenectady College, near New York, in the United States. Three days after his departure from his native shore, an insurrection broke out
among the tribe, arising chiefly from a wish on the part of their King to exchange prisoners i.j-en in battle, instead of adopting the usual barbarous custom of selling rliem for slaves. His humanity, however, interfered with an established perquisite long possessed by some of his prinefs I oflii.'ts. The Grandfather of the present AFRICAO) ROSCII/S, through their interested policy, fell a victim to his mutinous subjects. Deprived
of the means of .isserting his birthright, and to a certain degree cast upon the world as a cosmopolite, the Father became a Clergyman, and
officiates in New Vork. The subject of this memoir was born July 24th, 1807, aid was destined for the same profession; but preferring tb*
sotlc and buskin, be departed from his father's roof, and wended bis way to the shores of Old England."

Innkeeper's Daughter.
Her cheerful address Ailed the guests with delight,
A . .he welcomed them in with a smile j
Her heart was a stranger to childish affright,
Aud Mary would walk by the abbey at night.
When the wind whistled down the dark aisle.

Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle rold t
Again the rongh wind hurried by;
11 blew off Hie hat of the one, and behold,
Even close t« lh. f»«l of poor Mary it roll'd.
She fell, and expected to die.

All aronnd her was silent, .are when the rude blast
Howl'd dismally round the old pile;
Over weed-cover'd fragments still fearless she pasa'd,
And arrived at the innermost ruin at last,
Where the alder-tree grew in the aisle.

" Plague the hat," he exclaims, " nav, come on, and frst hide
The dead body," hi. comrade replies:
She beheld them in safety pass on by ber side.
She setae, the hat, fear her courage supplies,
And fast through the abbey she Sies.

Behind > wide column, half breathless with fear,
She crept to conceal herself there;
That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,
And she saw in the moonlight two ruffians appear,
And between them a corse did they bear.

She ran with wild speed—the rnsh'd in at th* door,
She east her eyes honitjly round:
Her limb, could 'support their faint harden no —ore.
But exhausted and bre.thless, .he sank on the Door,
Unable to utter a sound.

T H E AFRICAN ROSCIUS is the only Actor of colour that was e r r known, and probably the only instance that may occur j and havinf
t»en acknowledged by the Press of England, Ireland, and Scotland to posse,, histrionic talent of the highest order, the following Sketch of hi.
•Ufa may not be unacceptable;—-"The African's progenitors, down to the Graiidfather'tif the subject of thi, meinoir, were Princes of the Foulah
tribe, whose dominions were Senegal, on the banks of the river of that name. The Father of the present individual was sent for his eduction
t o Schenectady College, near New York, in the United States, Three days after his departure from his native shore, an insurrection broke oat
among the tribe, aiising chie8y from a wish on t!.e part of their King to exchange prisoners taken in battic, instead of adopting the usual barbarous custom of selling them for slaves. His humanity, ho« ever, interfered with an established perquisite long possessed by some of his priu
cipal officers. The Grandfather of the present ArmcaN Koscas, through their interested policy, fell a victim to his mutinous subjecis. Deprived
«f the mean, of asserting his birthright, and to a certain d'gree cast upon the world a. a cosmopolite, the Father became a Clergyman, and
officiates in New York. The subject of this memoir was horn July 24th, 1807, and was destined for the same profession ; but preferring tint
feck and buskin, he departed from his father's roof, and wended his way to the shores of Old England."

Why despise the "short and simple Annals of the Poor?" among which will be found some of the most Interesting Event, and heart-rending
Scenes in Real Life, more iruly touching to the sense, and more truly speaking to the heart, than all the pompous tales of " Lnrdlye Knight and
Ladye fair." Alas! how little do the Rich, revelling in wealth and luxury, know of the cares and troubles, the miseries and deprivations under
which the Poor labour; and yet behold their patient suffering ! In this Drama, the fearfnl dream of Susan Hopley—the subsequent vision—
and the account of the Murder at the Old Manor-House, are subjects of thrilling intcresr!—Whilst the Servant Girl's Departure from the Home
of her Childhood, and her extraordinary Adventures in London, which eventually lead to the Discovery of the Murderers, render this Domestic
Drama one of the most powerfully interesting ever yet brought forward to public notice.

T o conclude with the interesting Domestic Drama of

MARY,

THE MAID OF THE INN.
Hei .heerful address filled the guests .villi delight,
A. she welcomed tlieni in with a smile;
Her heart was » stranger to childish affright,
And Mary would walk by the abbey at night.
When the wind whistled down the it**., aisle.

Then Mary could fwl li.r he.rt-blood curdle cold j
Again tiie rou.b wind harried by;
It blew off the hat of the on., and behold,
Even close to the feet of poor Mary It roll'd.
She fell, and expected to die.

All .round her was silent, save when the rude blast
Howl'd dismally round the old pile;
Over weed-.over'd Ir.iitnent. still fearless she pass'd,
And airived at the innermost inin at last.
Where the alder.tree grew in the aisle.

" Plague the hat," he exclaims." nay, com* on, ted fi.,t hid*
The dead body," bis comrade repl'iei:
She beheld them in safety pass on by her .ide.
She seizes the hat, fear her courage'supplies.
And fast through the abbey she flies.

Behind a wide column, half breathless with fear,
She ran with wild speed—she rush'd in at this door.
She cast her eyes horribly round:
She crept to corneal herself there;
Her limbs could support their taint burden no more.
That instant the moon o'ei a dark cloud .hone ilear,
But exhausted and breathless, she sank on the door,
And she saw in the moonlight two ruffians appear,
Unable to utter a sound.
And between them > rorse did they bear.

M A R Y R
THE MAID OF THE INN,
llei cheerful address lilted the quests with delight,
As she welcomed them in with a smile;
Her heart was a stranger to childish affright,
And Mary would walk by the abbey at night,
When the wind whistled down the dark aisle.

Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold;
Again the rough wind hurried by.
It blew off the hat of the one, and behold.
Even close to the feet of poor Mary it roll'd,
She fell, and expected to die.

All around her was silent, save when the rude blast
Howl',I dismally round the old pile;
Over weed-rovcr'tl fragments still fearless she pass'd,
And arrived at the innermost ruin at last,
Where the alder-tree grew in the aisle.

" Plague the hat,"' ht exclaims, *- nay, come on, and first hide
The dead body." his comrade replies:
She beheld them in safety pass on by her side,
She seizes the hat, fea her courage supplies.
And fast through the abbey she flies.

Behind a wide column, half breathless with fear,
She crept to conceal herself there;
That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,
And she saw in the moonlight two rultiins appear,
And between them a corse did they bear.

She ran with wild speed—she rush'd in at the door,
She cast her eyes horribly round :
Her limbs could support their taint burden no more,
But exhausted and breathless, she sank on the floor,
Unable to utter a sound.

FIRST NIGHT OF THE NEW FARCE OF

THE M. P. FOR THE ROTTEN BOROUGH.
On T U E S D A Y E V E N I N G , September T, 1841,
Will be presented a New Drama, written by SHIRLEY BROOKES, Esq.. (performed in London upward, of 60 Night.,) called

T H E CREOLE
Or, LOVE'S F E T T E R S .

" The dramatic form of Composition, more than any other, demands completeness; and it is not with an idea of appending
explanation to the picture he haa endeavoured to paint, that the writer of the play now presented offers the following' extract
from an historical work. But in illustration of the state of society in the Isle or France, previously to its becoming a British
possession a few lines from Mr. Pridham's valuable and interesting History of ' England's Colonial Empire,' may be acceptable,
«s justifying whatever use the dramatist has made of the recorded prejudices and antipathies of the various classes of residents
in the Island :—
" The Creole part of the population made themselves remarkable by the intrepidity they displayed on board the fleet, of
France, or by the efforts of individual enlerpiise,
" But the European looked with disdain upon the Creole, who, in turn, regarded the former as an adventurer.
" The Islander, were held in contempt by the poor Noblesse of Mauritius, on account of their ignoble extraction.
" It was remarked, also, that towards the latter ond of the century, the French inhabitants of Mauritius appeared neither
independent in their circumstances, nor easy in their minds, though they affected dress and gaiety.
* The condition of the Slave was that of the lowest and most abject degradation. Numbers of these unfortunates had European
blood in their veins, being the offspring of liaison* between the Planters and their Slaves, but such a pedigree only it.croa.ed
their misfortune."

C o n c l u d i n g W o r d s Of t h e D r a m a . — " May we b . permitted to remind those who have sympathised in the fortunes of our poor Slave Girl, that at this very hour there exists in other Countries, speaking our own language, thousands of
Maidens, as young—a, fair—as loving—and as liable to be bought and sold like beasts of the field. We can, perhaps, do but
little towards lightening their fate : but may we not remember, with a thankful pride, that our own is cast in a land where (with
all its faults) the chain is unknown— where Heaven's image is unsullied by the brand of Slavery."

FIRST TIME IN BATH OF T H E DRAMA OF

THE ROTTLE!
Taken from Mr. GEORGE CRUIKSHANK's Celebrated Work of the same name.
The success attending this Drama has been unprecedented; it has been represented in London, and in all the large Town. i»
England, Ireland, and Scotland, and universally allowed to be the best Moral Drama ever produced.

SEW " E v e r y .human act, good o r bad, is a n Angel to w a r n or to guide, and the deeds
of the worst a r e messages t o t h e hearts of t h e best—let u s profit by them. I t is good a t
times to be awakened from the easy common place things that surround our habitual life
to have laid open to us t h e vaults a n d caverns of the social state, and the d a r k e r secrets
of the human heart—'tis useful if we apply them. L e t u s hope that o u r little play is n o t
without i t s p u r p o s e ; for be assured, however humble t h e means employed, that facts,
like all h i s t o r y , Shall teach by example.'*—Concluding word, of the Drama.

On M O N D A Y and T U E S D A Y , Dec. 2 ? and 2 8 ,

Why despise the " .hort and simple Annals or the Poor?" among which will he found some of the most Interesting Event, and heart-rending
Scene, in Real Life, more truly touching to the sense, and more truly .peaking to the heart, than ail the pompous tales of " Lordlye Knight and
Ladye fair," Ala,! how little do the Rich, revelling in wealth and luxury, know of the care, and troubles, the miseries and deprivations under
which the Poor labour; and yet behold their patient suffering I In this Drama, the fearful dream of Susan Hopley—the subsequent vision—and
the account of the Murder at the Old Manor-House, are subjects of thrilling interest!—Whilst the Servant Girl's Departure from the Home of
her Childhood, and her extraordinary Adventure, in London, which eventnallv lead to the Discovery of the Murderers, render this Domestic
Drama one of the most powerfully interesting ever yet brought forward to public notice.

PROGRAMME—PART L
~~™=

I'm Afloat, I'm Afloat.
THE WIFE'S DREAM.
THE SPIRIT FIEND.
Up, up with my flag, let it wave o'er the sea,
I'm afloat, I'm afloat, and the rover is free! &a.

I'm afloat, I'm .float, on the fierce rolling tide,
The ocean's my home, and my bark is my bride ;

Lriever see you sulk or pout, or say au angry word,
Xnd yet you've plenty cause; fcfor tears, if all be true I've heard.

Now tell me, Mary, how it is that you can look so gay,
When evening after evening your husband is away ?

The Spirit Fiend cast his eyes abroad, and looked all o'er the laud,
And number d his myriad worshippers, with his bird-like long right hand,
He took his place in the teeming streets, and watch'd the people go
Around and about, with a buxz and a shout, for ever to and fro'.
And it's " Hip!" says the Spirit Fiend, " Hip! Hurrah! for the multitudes I see
Who offer themselves in sacrifice, and die for the love of rae."

The Song of t h e S h i r t

uWith

.........
With eyelid, heavy and red,
A woman sat in unwomanly rags.
Plying her needle and thread.

Stitch, stitch,

In poverty, hunger, and dirt,
And still, wfth a voice of dolorous pitch,
Shp sung this song of a shirt, &c.

tt..i..K

The New Song of the Scaffold.
" And the Lord said unto him. therefore, whosoever .layeth ('sin. vengeance shall hv takpn on him seven-fold, and the Irf>rd set«,
mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him."

THE MANIAC.
The Boatmen of the Ohio.
Hush ! 'tis the night watoh,
He guards my loneh cell.

(A SOI DISANT NEGRO MELODY.)

PART I I .

The New Song of the Lash.
" Away with the lash for ever,
'Tis a stain on a Christian land.'

The Gambler's Wife.
Diu-k is the night! how dark ! no light—no fire!
Cold on the hearth the last feint sparks e*rire!
Shivering, she watches by the cradle-side
For him who pledged her love ! LAST YEAR A BBII>K !
Hark, 'tis his footstep! No ! 'tis gone!
List! list! how wearily tun time rolls on!

Why should he leave me thus ? he once was kind;
And I BEMRVKD 'twould last! How mad! how blind!
Rest thee, my babe! Rest on! 'Tis hunger's cry 1
Sleep I for there's no food! the fount is dry!
Famine and cold their weary work hare dene!
My heart must break ! and then —the cloek strikes one!

THE SHIP ON FIR

The storm o'er the ocean flew furious and last,
Except when the lightning illum'd it in wrath :
And the waves rose in foam at the voice of the blastA young mother knelt in the cabin below,
And heavily laboured the gale-beaten ship,
And press'd her fond babe to her bosom of s n o w Like * stout-hearted swimmer—the spray at his lip;
She pray'd to her God, 'midst the hurricane wild,
And dork was the gky o'er the mariners' path,
" Oh, Father, have mercy! look down on my child!"
THE NEW NATIONAL SONG OF

There's a Good Time Coming.
There's a good time coming, boys,
A good time coming;
We may not live to see the day.
But earth shall glisten in the ray
Of the good time coming.

Cannon balls may aid the truth,
But thought's a weapon stronger,—
We'll win our battle by its aid :
Wait a little longer.
There's a good time ,'oming, &c.

Programme of the Principal Scenery and Incident, of the Ballet:—
Which commence! with the attempt, of Don Juan to gain admittance to the Palace of Don Guzman, the Commandant of Seville,
whose Daughter the Libertine is attached to. After many adventures, diversified by the Comicalities ol Scaramouch, Don Juan's
Valet, Juan enter, the Palace and Murder, the Commandant. The Alg.it.zila are summoned, and order, given for the pursuit of
t b . Murderer, who, in the confusion of the moment, ha. effected his escape.
The Scene now represents—A PICTURESQUE VIEW OF THE 8PANISH C3A8T AND VESSEL AT ANCHOR.
Don Juan succeeds in getting on board the Vessel, which sets sail and leave, the Coast.

Tempest—Shipwreck—Don Joan and Scaramouch thrown Ashore.
Juan is hospitably entertained by the Fishcrwomen. but repays their kindness by ingratitude, and shoots the husband of Vilotia.
VILLAGE FETE— DANCE—ABDUCTION OF THE BRIDE BY JUAN.

A Fas seul, by Miss Assiottl.
ACT U—commences with a view of the Cemetery of Seville, and MONUMENTAL EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF THE
MURDERED GUZMAN. Juan enters, followed by Scaramouch, who directs the attention of his Master to the Monument.
Juan, in derision, unites the Statue to Supper. The Monumental Statue suddenly becomes animated; and, to the horror of the
Libertine, accepts the Invitation. Juan recovers his courage, and defies the Spectral EtHjfy, and the t'omb is Superuaturally
Illuminated, and exhibits the following inscription in letters of Blood :—* By thee I died ; thy fate's decreed. Heaven wiil
avenge the bloody deed." The progress of the Ballet conducts to a Spl, odid Saloon in the Mansion of Don Juan The appearance of the Spectral Statue of the Governor at the Feast. The impious conduct of Juan, and the Spectacle concludes wi'.h

UNIQUE ENTERTAINMENT!
POSITIVELY FOR T H I S N I G H T ONLY,

MONDAY, November I B , IS ID.
Mr. H A Y (formerly Lessee of the Establishment)
Most respectfully informs the Nobility, Gentry, and Inhabitants of Bath and its Vicinity, that he will have the honour to
introduce to them h:s DAUGHTER,

LOUISA FOOTE H A Y
Designated, from the Brilliancy and Sweetness of her Voice,

T H E LIVERPOOL LIND!
AND THE

INFANT ALICE, only Five Years of Age I
Mr. W M . T A Y L O R (from Bristol) will preside at tin. Piano-Forte,
and also Perform T w o brilliant Concertos.
Mr. H A Y will give his Popular Sketches of Character!
Introducing " The Anld Scotch Woman, with a wee bit Anecdote;"
"Grumbling Sat;"
" Mrs. Digby Jones preparing her House for an Evening Party;"
And Master Angus.us Fitzhardtng Snobbs, who will take a tacit part in a Duet, " His Same is
Jforral," (being positively hisfirstappearance on any Stage.)
Mr. HAY will Sing the Comic Song, " Description of a London Theatre."
" Miss HAY'S CONCERT.—This young- lady entirely justified our expectation, and proved that she justly merited the praises
bestowed upon her by the provincial press. The Liverpool Timet has designated her the ' Liverpool Liod.' Never, in our
opinion, was that term more misapplied. There is nothing: Lind-like in the voice or appearance of Louisa. The voice of Miss
Hay, sweet and metallic, is of a mezzo soprano kind, telling- most effectively in the lower regions, but rather overshaded in the
higher notes. 1t is , lovely voice, but not at all like that of Jenny. If we were allowed to make a comparison, we should
liken it to that of Todi, the celebrated rival of Mara; and with that charming and sweet singer the outward appearance of
Louisa Hay also bears many traces of likeness. A more interesting face than Louisa's cannot be seen: there is a shadow of
sweet melancholy spread over her hectic cheeks, and a deep-lying eye glances from beneath a dark brow, with a lustre of
romantic intensity, which at once penetrates to the heart. And so is her singing: always sweet, sometimes brilliant, and never
overstrained. Her rendering of slow and simple melodies is indeed charming, and we could not help being touched to the cores
of our heart, with the unadorned, but deep-felt fervency of expression she threw into some of her songs on Thursday last.
' The Banks of Allan Water;' Haydn's unsurpassed Canzonet, ' She never told ;' and ' Ruth's Lamentation,' amongst others
left everything behind we have ever heard from any juvenile singer."—Bristol Timet, November 10, 1849.

On the departure of the King, Silvs releases Ernani, and
challenges him to fight; he, however, requests first (o see once more Elvira, and on learning that she has been carried off, tell.
Silva that the King is their rival. Silva summons his followers, and promises that he will delay his vengeance on Ernani until
after he has beeu revenged on the king, on the receipt of a horn from Ernani, as a token that, when Silva wishes for hi. life,
he will at once destroy himself, on hearing one blast from it. Ernani then departs with Silva and his followers in search of the

Embracing .ita.tion. of inch deep and powerful interest!—of such supernatural and startling effects !—and of .net. solemn at
appeals to the best feeling's of human nature as to render the thrilling anxiety of the spectator more intense and more atrong at it. r.
than can be remembered ever to hare occurred within the will, of a Theatre ! ! !
Why despite the "' short and simple Ann.l. of th.- Poor?" among which will be found «ome of the most Interesting Event, and ....
Scenes in Heal Life, more really touching to the sense, and more truly speaking to the heart, than all the pompmis tales of' Lordlve Knigat and
Ladye fair." Alas! how little do the Rich, revelling in wealth and luxrv, know of the cares and troubles, the miseries and deprivations under
which the Poor labour ( and yet behold their patient suffering! In this Drama, the fearful dream of Susan Hopley—the subsequent vision—and
the account of the Murder at the Old Manor-House, are subjects of thrilling interest!—Whilst the Serva.t ijirl's Departure from the Hume of
her Childhood, and her extraordinary Adventures in London, which eventually lead to the Discovery of the Murderers, render this Domestic
Drama on. of the most powerfully interesting ever yet brought forward to public notice.

Scene, in Real Life, more really touching the sense, and more truly speaking to the heart, than ail the pompous tale, of ' Lordly. Knight and
L.dye fair.'* Alas! how little do the Rich, revelling in wealth and luxury, know of the cares and troubles, the miseries and deprivations under
which the Poor Labour ; and yet behold theii patient suffering [ In this Drama, the fearful dream of Susan Hopley—the subsequent vision—and
the account of the Murder at the Old Manor-House, are subjects of thrilling interest!—Whilst the Servant Girl's Departure from the Home of
her Childhood, and her extraordinary Adventures in London, which eventually lead to the Discovery of the Murderers, render this Domestic
Dram, one of the most powerfully interesting ever yet brought forward to public notice.
