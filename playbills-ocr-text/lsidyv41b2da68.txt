Io the course of the Entertainment the following SONGS and PARODIES : “ Pray Goody.H •* I've Kiss'd and I've Prattled.” “ A Master I had.” “ Life of Giovanni.” “ Dear, dear, what can the matter be?” “Oh! rest thee, Babe.” “ Young Love.” “ Wapping Old Stairs.” “O, Remember the Titne.” “ Quite Politely.” “ Cease your Funning ”	“ Scots wha ha’e.”
N. B. It has been erroneously imagined by those persons who have not witnessed the Performance, that it is a " Tale twice told,” and founded on the old worn-out piece of Don Juan ; it may therefore be necessary to add, that this Drama begins where the Italian Opera finishes, that the Hero and I.eperello are placed in situation« entirely nouvelle, and that the incidents arising from those situations are completely original.

OPENING
OF THE
FELLOW TOWNSMEN,
Perceiving1 by the Advertisement and Bills that our Favourite has been again discharged, without any reason being given to the Public, it is necessary that we should, as the Guardians of our own Amusements, demand from the Managers the Cause that has led to this discharge?—Miss CRAMER wasintroduced to the Public by the Managers after the late misunderstanding, and they declared all that was past should be buried in oblivion; are we then to suppose that Miss CRAMER’S absence is voluntary, or that she is the victim of Managerial tyranny ?—Do not infringe on

MISS CRAMER’S
APPEAL
TV» the Publie
MISS CRAMER having been suddenly discharged from the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, considers it a duty incumbent on her, to lay before that Public, who have always so liberally supported her, a full Statement of the Facts.
On Monday the 6th Inst* Miss C. was solicited by Mr. Kalkbrenner to sing at his Jflorning Concert; she consented, having no Rehearsal to attend at the Theatre; in consequence of which Mr. Lewis refused to pay her HER WEEK’S SALARY, although Miss Graddon, Mr. Thorne, Mr. Penson, Miss Rock, Mr. Andrews, Mrs. Aldridge, and Miss Hammersley had been allowed to sing frequently at different Concerts, both here and at Manchester, and their Salaries were not witheld from them. Miss C. astonished at the undue severity used towards her when she had only been singing for a Friend of her late Father, and without remuneration, at first refused to perform till she had received her Salary; hut on consideration that by so doing she would injure two individuals whose Benefits take place this Week, she proffered her services both to Mr. Bass and Mrs. Radcliffe, which was gladly received by them, but peremptorily denied by Mr. Lewis, and thus she was forbidden ever to appear before the Liverpool or Manchester Audiences again.
Miss C. in thus appealing to her Friends, trusts they will not consider she has overstepped the bounds of propriety, when she adds, she is an Orphan, without Brother or Protector, and entirely dependant on a GENEROUS PUBLIC.
