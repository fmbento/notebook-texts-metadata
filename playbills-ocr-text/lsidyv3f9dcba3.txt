| jbltunv-LANE.—Mr. Kean last night played Holla, but it was fur iii%benefit, and on such occasions actors are privileged to make bold experiments, in the hope of drawing full bouses. To compare his performance of this character, with the performance of Johm Kemble would !>c ridiculous, almost as ridiculous ns to compare the two in Coriolanut, should Mr. Kean' ever be tempted to appear in that clmntctcr. All we can say of his effort lust night, is, that lie |>kyed as well as nature, and his own taste would permit. He was full of bustle, activity, and sometimes energy ; I»« these were slender substitutes, for the dignity, we hod almost said, the sublimity, and lie-roical grandeur, of Kemble. Holla’s addrress to bis soldiers, which used to electrify the audience when delivered by the latter, came poorly and tamclv off amid the starts, pauses, and trickery of .Mr. Kean. It is not in characters of this description he should ever appear. We defy him to pourtray the workings of a noble, generous, and lofty mind. When the curtain dropped, Ids friends called for him to appear, but we are happy to think our remonstrances iij>on this toiipery have had their efirct. Mr. Klas’ resisted the call, though
long and vociferously made, and did not com; ibrward_
In the afterpiece he placed Diggnrg, in All t'te World's a Stage. It was his benefit night, and therefore we shall not waste criticism up,on on undertaking which is not likely to be repeated, at least till next year.

Dkvrv-laxe Theatre.—A numerous anil brilliant '■ party assembled at this theatre on Saturday evening, to view the improvements that have been made in the interior during the recess. The plan of reducing the size of the audience-part of the theatre has been abandoned lor the present, and no material change has taken place, except in the decorations. The gilt ornaments in front of the boxes remain the same as before; but a crimson ground has been substituted for the cold blue colour which has so long prevailed at this theatre. This is certainly an improvement, and we could also have wished that some other colour had suwrseded the blue which still remains on the ceiling and the backs of the boxes. Some new scenery was exhibited, superior, we think, to any before produced here. The architectural drop-curtain is exceedingly splendid, and displays much elaborate execution. After promenading for a snort time on the stage, the company repaired to the saloon (where a band was stationed), and quadrilles and country-dances commenced. During the intervals of dancing several songs were sung by Miss Povey and Messrs. !'- Cook and Du ruse t. A profusion of elegant refreshments was provided, md the company retired at a late hour, highly gratified with the entertainment which Mr. Elliston’s liberality had afforded them. The new portico, erected in front of the box entrance in Brydges-street, will, when finished, have a very elegant effect. It is surmounted, by a statue of Shakspeare-	... ,11
The performances of this theatre, for the winter season commenced yesterday evening with the comedy of the Mood to Hvin. The cast of the characters remains so nearly the same as when it was last acted here,that description or com ment may be spared. To state that JElliston, Miss Kelly" Harley, and Knight, retain their share in its attractions, is an assurance that much of the original spirit is preserved and that the lovers of genuine comic acting may depend on a fund of amusement. The audience did not fail to offer, in the liveliest manner, their greetings to these distinguished favourites, as they made their appearance in succession on the stage. A description of the new decorations will he found in another part of our paper. The theatre was but -moderately attended. This evening a different appearance Will no uoubt be presented, as the performances are not only of the best kind, bat are appropriated to the benefit of the widow and family of that late deserving actor, Mr.
Rae. The unprotected situation in which they" have been left h is awakened in an unusual degree the sympathy of the public.	•

THE DRURY-LANE BAND.
•	■	2.Ï2
*—‘‘ AND MUSIC WON THE CAUSE.”—Dryden.
AN erroneous and exparte Report having appeared in several of the public prints on Wednesday last, relative to the differences now subsisting between the Manager of the Theatre and the Gentlemen attached to the Orchestra, and most of the Editors (such is the powerful effect of Theatrical Patronage !) having refused to insert a Counter Statement, altho’ payment was offered, I am induced, in order to exculpate Four respectable individuals, and the Profession to which they belong, from the odium attempted to be cast upon it by the degradation of a Bow-Street investigation, to submit to the Public the following facts, that they may understand how it came to pass that professors of a Liberal Art were served with police warrants, grounded upon an Act made and passed to prevent combinations among Journeymen Weavers !
On Saturday, the 6th of January, Messrs. Daly and Smalley, belonging to the Band, refused to play in the Pantomime, because they were fined their whole week's salary, on account of an unavoidable absence for One Evening out of the Six, (an indulgence usually allowed on sending an efficient Deputy). Another member (Mr. Barker) was also fined, and had part of his salary, as he conceived, unjustly withheld, and, upon that account, also objected to perform until he was fully satisfied. As to the fourth person charged with neglect of duty, and who was favoured with Mr. Bimie’s hand and seal upon the occasion, he had no more to do with combination than the statue of Apollo de Belvidere; nevertheless, he was driven with the others, like a poor inoffensive Bullock, to the slaughter-house!
Since the concern has been under the present Management, all power and control over the Musical Department has been entirely taken away from the Leader; the consequence is, that many unnecessary Rehearsals take place, and vexatious fines are imposed, and rigidly exacted, for trivial omissions that would not otherwise happen or be levied. A singular and unheard- /! system of espionage is likewise adopted in the Orchestra, by having Two Forfeit Masters placed there, constantly on the watch to record the little sinnings or peccadilloes of the Musicians, and who are forced, under severe penalties, to furnish, separately, weekly lists of the Defaulters, not excepting even the Leader !! This gentleman, who has filled the situation and so ably presided over the Orchestra for many years past, was lately insulted by an attempt to retain a Night’s Salary, on account of a casual absence, which he very properly resisted, and the Fine was in consequence not persisted in.
The ex post facto Rules and Regulations (the root of the discord), and of which so much has been said, were never shewn to the Band until after every person was engaged and the present season had commenced. However, as soon as they were promulgated and sent for approval and signature, they were rejected una voce, and consigned to “ the tomb of the Capodets, being contrary to all former custom, and decidedly against the spirit of each individual engagement; notwithstanding which, the “ Property,” as it is called, are proceeding upon this left-handed WiNSTON-tan code, as though it contained the laws of the Medes and Persians, which alter not.
As to what passed before the Magistrate, it is only necessary to say, that Mr. Harmer denies the correctness of the statement in the Times and some other newspapers*, and that he did not make the concessions therein mentioned, or use the language imputed to him, as against the parties for whom he appeared, who also declare that they did not exhibit that snivelling thankfulness me» tioned in the Report, when the Prosecutor and his Inform» were forced to abandon their charge as untenable.
A Meeting of the Members of the different Orchestras in London will shortly be convened by advertisement, in order to publish a vote of censure upon the authors of this disgraceful piece of Managerial Intolerance, who dared to force artists of superior character and connections to appear at a Common Police Office (the tribunal for thieves and vagabonds) to answer to a frivolous and nonsensical charge, and who were treated with as little respect as though they had been a set of Itinerant Minstrels in custody of the Parish Watch, upon a charge of infringing the privileges of Mr. Munro’s Licensed Westminster Waits !”

DKUKY-LANE THEATRE.
On Tuesday night, after the tragedy of Jane Shore, the new Christmas pantomime, which has been for some lime ia preparation, wa< exhibited to the public. It is called the North Passage, or Harlequin Esquimaux j a title very happily <*hi»sen, on account of the great interest whi«b thp British € public have felt in Ihe late voyage* of discovery towards the £' \*>rtb Pole; and its commencement was »qually happy in the patriotic allusions which were made to our brave and adven- ;■ furous navigators, who had effected so great a progress towards Ihe long wj*hed-f«»r discovery. This entertainment, ag has usually been the case with others of a similar description, «as ushered ia with r great display of supernatural agency, the whole of which was highly imposing and inle-resting. The first scene presents a sublime view of t‘e ' iroien sen, the icebergs, and the northern lights; and here ^ a set of imaginary beings, the Genii of these dismal regions, came forward in their respective chnracte,** Among these is the Oenius of the North, clad in. his vaowy garments, and seated in a car drawn by tw** bears, who, hearing that Eng- r . Ush ships had ventured inti» bis dominions, whet* no navigators liad ever come before, threaiens them with his ven- t eeance for their temeriiy ; and in this inhospitable dt«ign he is assisted by another Genius, who is called Boreas. H the / .mean time Neptune arrives, and after complimenting j;e . :y naval heroes of Britain, to whom every part of the ocean has < always been accessible, command* the angry demons to desist from their purpose. The next scene presents a grand view of th** hills of crimson snow ; a tut several British sailors and Esquimaux present themselves. Among the latter i* a young girl, between whom and a young male Esquimaux, there is a ! mutual attachment, and whom ihe Geuius of the North shuts j up in an iceberg, because she refuses to admit of his amorous addresses. After this there is a sublime vlewnf Prince Regent’s Straits, and the Uecia discovery ship at anchor. The Esquimaux come and view the ship and sailors with amaze- » meat. Neptune again appears and releases the female Esquimaux from her icy prison, changes her into Columbine, and her lover into Harlequin The two mischievous demons are at the same time changed into Pantaloon and Clown, and they begin their accustomed flights, pu suits, and gambols, together with conflicts, accidents, «-scapes, &c. This latter pari of the business was not so happily executed as the foregoing. ^Towards the conclusion of the performance, some disapprobation was expressed by a p&rt of the audience. The whole concluded with a splendid view of Neptune’s Palace ; and the pantomime was announced for another representation, amidst several cries of No —no ; but a great majority of tbe audience were favourable 1o »*. This entertainment may be greatly improved by curtailing >« me of the scenes; & then it will ii&od a chance of having aghodiiin.

OUTLINE OF THE FABLE :
During the intestine wars of Italy, Montalto’s patron, the father of Laura, and head of one of the contending parties, dying, is sucreeded io his command and territorial possessions by Mon^alto, vrbo acquires great renown by his exploits in war, and his victories over his opponents. In the life time of Mootalto's predecessor, some intention seems to hare been entertained of an union between him and his cousin Laura, who appears to have been somewhat in love with him. But, shortly after his accession to power, that project is abandoned. Montalto, ere yet the funeral rites of his patron were well closed, is united to Julia, a lady to whom he seems to have been long passionstely attached, and who is fondly and tenderly devoted to him. Some time a/ler Laura is privately married to Durazzo. the highest end most favoured officer in Monlalto's service. Glowing with resentment at the supposed ■light put upon her by Montalto, and fired with the ambitious project of possessing herself of liis domains, to which she conceives herself entitled as heiress of her late father, Laura thirsts for vengeance, and seeking to gratify her desires by plotting the overthrow of Montalto, induces Michael, tlu brother oi Durazzo, to participate in her purpose. To this [ Michael (a perfect Italian villain, rather closely copied from lago), who burns with a secret passion for Julia, readily con sent*, in the hope, after Montalto’s death, of possessing himself of hfs wife, and by the sacrifice of Durazzo and Lr.ura, of his power and estates. Durazzn is dragged into the scheme, but being only a half-hred villian, is with much difficulty kepi to his purpose by the united exertions of Laura and Michael. They do, how ever, contrive to influence him onward to the end, and through him the mischief is accomplished. Montalto being encamped with his troops al a considerable distance from his castle, wherein he has left his wife, bis children, and Laura, under the charge of Durazzo and Michael, the trio oi conspirators enter into a secret correspondence with his enemy, Count Bassano, (a personage often spokeo of, but never seen throughout the play) for the purpose of betraying him iDto his power ; Si form a plau for tormenting him a ith the pang* of jealousy. Iu the Workings of the latter, nearly the whole of the interest of the pi*ce consists. An anonymous Inter, couched in arobi* guous metaphor, being placed upon the table in Montalto’s teat, which induces him to smpect that his wife, in his absence, entertains tome secret lover, causes him suddenly to quit the camp and return to his castle, where he arrives before daybreak. Under the walls, he (very unnecessarily, as no use is made of it afterwards) confides his secret to lii* attendant. Rosano, and charges him to observe Julia closely , which done, a numerous retinue, with Laura at their head, issue from the caatle, and, rather unexpectedly, we believe, finding Montalto and Rosano together tear the gate, assume the appearance of having come out to receive them. Montalto, with jealous feel-iogs,ex presses his surprise that Juliadocs nolcomelo meet him Laura pleads the suddenness of his appearance 8c the unusual hour, at an excuse for her non-attendance. Michael takes ■n early opportunity of beirg alone with Montalvo, and by dark ■nd mysterious hints, couched under a veil of blunt honesty, of IS correspondence carried on between Julia and some unknown person without the castle, heightens hi* jealousy, and bis efforts arts admirably seconded by Laura, who is overheard by Montalto, it» conversation with Julia, to mention hi* name as he enters the apartment. Antonio and Rt naldo having discovered that a aecret corrtspondence has for some lime been carried on with Bs«sano by somebody within the castle, and that a lady of the ensile is at tire bottom of the plot, dettruiinc to acquaint Mosliltn with the circumstance forthwith, and accordingly wait Sh the gallery into which his bed-chamber opens, for that purpnse. Julia i* then seen to re tire to real, and Montalto aoon after approaching with the name intent, it by them informed of their discovery ; when, in the height of his jealousy, which drives him nearly to frenzy, he supposes Julia to be the lady in the correspondence, and that Baisano,« linm he remembers to have been her father**gueaf, is her secretly favoured lover Fired with this thought, after dia misting hit informants, hr at length works himself up to the re solution of putting her to death. With that intention fie proceeds to (he chamber where she is sleeping, but observing her to »mile as he looks oo her asleep, Ilia resolution ia staggered, and he ruahes out of the room. Quickly, however, his jealousy reverts to that deeping smile as the effect of associ atiou, in her dreams with Basaano, and, resuming hi* dire ip feat, he is about to re-enter the ehamber with uplifted dagger, .when Julia, havinc awoke, and feeline surprised at his absence
meets him on the threshold. She fondly complains of his ab-senee and his gloom, nnd urges him to reveal its cause. As; she is pleading to him, the dagger, which he had hastily hidden beneath his cloak, falls at his feet. Imagining that he had intended self-destruction, she, in reply to his eager demand of the dagger, throws it away, aud, clinging round his neck, tenderly remonstrates with him on his supposed purpose, affectionately entreats hnu to impart to her his grief* and his sufferings, until at length, softened and nearly overcome by her fondneK*, he suffers her to lead him into the bed-chamber, but without unfolding his auspicious. In the dead of the night, t&hile all the other inmates of the casile are buried in sleep, Michael having intoxicated the guard, Durazzo, after some struggles with his conscience, is induced, by the united persuasions of Michael and Laura, to complete their undertaking by opening the gates, and going out to meet the advancing troops of Bassano, which he lernas into the castle, opposed only by Antonio and a few followers. The alarm having sounded, Monta!to awakes, and being informed of the entrance of Be* sano’s troops, thro’ the treachery of Durazzo, after deep imprecations upon Julia, issues to the combat, in which, after killing Michael, Durazzo having thrown away his own life by rushing into the thickest of the fight, he is defeated and mortally wounded. In this state he is borne into the armory by his attendants. While he is charging Rinaldo to carry the news of bis death to Julia, and to repeat to her lit« dying curse, she having been told that he was killed, rushes in, half distracted, with her child. In the agony of death, aggravated by the work . ings of jealousy, be calls upoo Heaven to register the curse of a dying husband upon his wife ; but scarcely has he uttered the imprecation, when Rosano entering, informs him that laura, in a paroxysm of mingled remorse and grief for the fall of Durazzo, had confessed to him that his suspicion* of Julia, as also hia betrayal to Bassaon, were entirely the result of her machinations. Upon hearing this, be changes his curies into bles sings, and entreating to be forgiven, falla dead at the feet ot Julia, who drops lifeless on his corpse.
The above will be found a tolerably faithful out line of this tragedy. It will he seen—indeed it is admitted by the author in his prologue—that Mootalto is nothing more than an imitation of Othell*. Montalto’s cause of jea-' lousy differs from that of Shakspeare’s unequalled hero ; but its paroxysms and its progress are copied with a feeble, though not unskilful, hand. Michael is a different edition of lag« —somewhat more cautious, ami having some-l V7hat wore of reason lor his pe'fidy than his great prototype. But in all his actions the memory of Shakspeare , rushes upon us ; and, instead of listening to the author of Montalto, we are repeating to ourselves those passages which associate with our recolleciion of the immortal bard. What Shakspeare touched he converted into gold— be made »t hisown; and it is like the Titans attempting to utaie Heaven—-to contend with the efforts of his magic verse. He look all naturé for his range—he was familiar with her spirit—she was at once his model and his friend. He looked into the human heart for the motives of human action ; and he traced to lheir source the various impulses that direct, controul, or pervert our feelings. He drew man as lie is found at a 111mies to exist—lie has not looked to individuals for hie character-—he ha* taken the mass’ ; and his |K»riraits of one man is that of every man of a similar des¡ ription. Not so with those who have succeeded him. Their views have been individualized and narrow. They w rote for the time—he wrote for all time ; “ Exhausted worlds and then imagined new.” Those who follow hi/ri seem blinded by his excessive light—even 44 his parting glories” were too much for them to endure; and they are now only known to those w ho make a merit of collecting old tracts, which nobody cares to read, or whose pages, if read, could not afford aBy thioglike rational amusement. Of course there are splendid exceptions to this charge ; but it too generally applies to the great body of dramatic writers from the time of Elizabeth to ihe hour in which we «rite these observatons. Mon tallo exhibits no inconsiderable share of poetical talent and dramatic knowledge. We are besides inclined to afford indulgence to a first attempt, especially where that attempt gives fair hope of promise for the future. To be successful, however, an author should trust almost wholly to ids own powers. To originality much is pardoned ; to imitation very little ; ami, even though successful, the meed of praise we give is slender in the extreme. Where the dramatic genius exists, it will develope itself in despite ol every obstacle ; where it is not, no labour in the verse—no tact iu the arrangement of the part* can possibly secure a lasting reputations or produce an effective play . He who boldly adventures will meet kindred spirits to cheer him on his high career—he who creeps along the ground must subject himself to the fate otthose whose path is of no greater elevation.

The Tragedy of -
MON T ALTO
Was received with great Applause, and cannot fail to become a distinguished favourite of the Public.
The New Comic Pantomime ealled, The
NOU1 H	P.ASSaCwK; or, Harlequin Esquimaux.
Is now so completely established irt universal favour, that it will be repealed until further Notice.
The attraction of the Operatic Part of this Theatre encreases nigntly.
The LOUD of the MANOR
Was performed, for the fifth time, on Thursday Evening with universal Applause, and given out for repiesen at'on To-mor ore Wednesday, with repeated cheers. ^
The NEW TRAGEDY will be repe ted every Eveningtiil further Notice, except To-morrovr

and then dashed with a spice of feeling;; but his concep- ( tion, generally,seems cold and pointless, and his execution' ’ is one of two extremes, feebleness or rant. His manner is n stiff, tliough sometimes Ins action is extremely graceful ; * *■» but, “ take him tor all in all,” lie fk unequal to sustain the *	.
first walk in tragedy. Booth struggled through Durazzo with a bad person and ¡1 broken voice, and made the most of an irresolute villain, who had just head enough to calculate Ids interest, without that integrity of pdm ¡pie which would induce an honest man to prefer poverty and rags, to titles and possessions when earned hy treachery and crime. -Cooper, who is new to ourstage, played Michael well. He is a well-formed young man, with a quick eye and a thorough know ledge of that essential attribute in an actor 1 ■ —bye-play. IIis part in Montalto was odious and repulsive; hut lie softened its features, anil took from it that , coarseness without which ils representation could scarcely . bet'deraUd. His voice seems tohave a powerful volume ;	‘1 I
and, when alits height,to he rather inarticulate. He must' , i look to this: though a mellow voice is desirable at Drnry-Lane, a distioctenunciation must accompany it, or it loses, . more than half its value. Mrs. Egcrton’s Lady Laura w as ■' too much in the style of her Meg Merilies. Sirs. W. West ) did all she could for Lady Julia ; nor did we at all wonder that Montalto forewent his dreadful purpose when under" the fascination of her irresistible entreaty. On its first representation Montalto was by the one third too long—it wearied out the audience ; and as it is a play of more narration than incident, can the less hope fur excuse in being so unnecessarily lengthened out. With judicious curtail-1, rj ment it will run its season, and prove (we hope) a source «(profit to its promising author, and the manager of this t theatre. The prologue, vririrh we understand to be from the pen of the Hon (¡eorge Lamb, was very well spoken by Mr. Cooper, and a lively epilogue lost nothing of its -	■
animation in the bauds of Mrs. Edwin.

Those nothing loth to Uke them ns they’re uttered." * ♦ » •
Treason hath many readings—Sye, good lady,
As many as the interests that live Encompass'd in the art As passion points,
'Tis treason, or ’tin virtue to the few —
The eieot doth make it either to the mao}.”

.T
The oriier of the Poetry in Montalto may, in some degree, be gathered from the following- extracts:— *
K0SANA.
“ Woman is the perfect sum of all.
Love, gentleness, and honour—virtue, delicacy,”
Truth, charity, compassion, loveliness—
All this is woman —and thus form’d, she makes Existence, bliss—this world, a paradise.”
MONTILTO.

PROLOGUE —Spokes by Ms. Coopir.
A nation’« ills, a sinking throne’s alarms,
The fall of empires, aad the crash of arms:
Such Ihernes alone of old (lie scene supplied,
When stilted Tragedy, in gorgeous pride,
Scorn’d common nature’s truer, nearer woe.
Which touches all, for all in turn must know.
Thus, Gorbome was prais’d in ruder days,
Thus King Coplietua storm'd in Pistol’s phrase ;
* Thus all astounding did Almauzur strut,
Of mobs-the idol, while of wits the butt.
Ah ' such e’en Dryden’s course upon the stage, Doom’d with bombast to cloy a tainted age ;
And eVn his lightning genius through the gloom Now beams obscur’d, aod shines within a tomb.
Oh, foppish taste1 that from the course could stray, lu path where Shakspeare’s self had led the way. Well had he shewn what cares the mightiest heeds, What little motives mix with greatest deeds;
Gave mind* as welt as actions to our ken,
His hemes, monarch*—but hi* monarch*, men. Thi> path our author seeks, aod should he tread, Too near attracted, and too fondly led,
Retrace some scenes the Bard from nature drew (And varying nature can be ever new),
Dare, like the eagle, on the sun to gaze,
Aad urge his flight through all its brightest blaze; Yet, should a native genius still inspire,
Pour forth hi* verse, and oft hit fancy fire,
Ye will not censure—cannot be severe—
To honour Shakespeare must be blameless here.

EPILOGUE—Spoken by Mrs. Edwin.
Is Nature’s print ¡'.legible, slurr’d o’er With vill’nous blots, or are her character*
Goodly and fair to gaae on ? if thou read’st Aught worse than honour in that open front, —Aught in those ejes, but virtue and chnste love,
The fault doth lie in thee. Can daemons wrest The tarred stamp of Nature from her grasp,
To pass such cunning forg’ries on the world,
Or heaven's otvp signet falsify ?”
micbael djrazzo.
“ IIow shall I sptak of fears, of doubts, suspicions, That rise up all unbidden in the mind.
Founded a* oil* on fancy, »r ou fact,
Self-born, impossible of proof? Suspicion Doth live on atomic*, on shadows,
On whisp’rings as on silence—contrarieties ;
On combination of a thousand nothings.
Impervious to your view, seen clear by mine.
It doth depend, my lord, on forms of intellect,
Ac various as the «hulls that case it in.
How shall all tfm be spoken , IIow to minds incredulous made manifest ?”
JULIA.
....................* “ Women's tear#
Shivering with cold, in spite of frost and fog,
I'm summon'd, Sirs, to speak the Epilogue:
What is an Epilogue ?—(dear, how I quake !) k \! ’Tis a gilt Image on a new Twelfth Cake; t When the Cake’s cut. the Image melts away,
‘ So, good bye, Epi, if you cut the Play.
Montalto’a dead, ye husbands, mark the t«>ken, } Cherish your wives—heed what oar bard has spoken— > ' Or your heads, like Montaltu’s, will be broken.	\
A poet’« fate is changeful as the dice;
The man who writes a drama, walks on ice.
On fee. Who doesn’t ? All the town is slipping : While the frost lasts e’en Quakers are caught tripping.

Thursday, *4pril 26, 1821.
LORD BYRON’S Tragedy of MARINO FALIERO, was received, last Night, with the Applause and Aeclamation which had been anticipated from the high genius of its distinguished Author. Its repetition would have been announced for this Evening, as a matter of course; but certain Persons, on grounds at present incapable of being understood, and which remain to be explained and justified, have thought fit to obtain an INJUNCTION in CHANCERY, against the Representation of the PLAY. Under these extraordinary Circumstances, the further Performance of the Tragedy must for the present moment be suspended. It is conceived, however, that the Impediment thus thrown in the w ay, not only of the Interests of the Theatre, but of the Gratification of the Public, can be but of very short duration, and that the Piece will, before long, be again exhibited w ith the brilliant success which attended its performance yesterday Evening.

i	THEATRE ROYAL, DRURY LANE,
Monday, April SO, 1831.
As the legal question in respect to tlie Performance of Lord Byron's Tragedy is still to be discussed, much remark, as to wha» has passed, would be, at present, unnecessary and improper. Nothing has been done,' on the part of the Theatre, in this affair, which has not. in numberless instances, occurred before; and the practice of Theatres, in such cases, will, no doubt, continue the same, unless the law shall’ show it to be erroneous. On one point, however, it is material to guard against misapprehension. It has been somewhere suggested, that the manner in which this Play was produced originated in sordid motives. If this refers to the fact of the Tdkt having been obtained from the Publication, that fact justifies no such inference. The noble Author is fully aware, as his immediate Friends and Agents in this country are, that any'Compensation for the first possession of his valuable Work, within the capability of the Theatre to offer, and which such an Author could hare condescended to accept, waa at bis command; ar.d that, in the tender submitted to his Lordship. • while the Tragedy was understood to be in progress, all possible delicacy and attention were observed, as to the mode by which such object of compensation could be effected. •His Lordship’s Publisher, also, well knows that there was an earnest disposition to admit him to a participation in the Benefit of the Performance, could the Performance June taken place before the Publication. So far, the public miml should be, at once, set right. When the Possessor of this Theatie shall reject any literary effort,
t	*
as unsuited to stage use, and shall, -afterwards, on publication, attempt to make such materials available, then, and not uutil then, will he plead guilty to a disposition to withhold from genius the reward to which it is entitled; and to which a Stronger claim could not have existed, than in the present interesting and splendid instance.
Of the fitness of Lord Byron's Tragedy for Representation, as performed at this Theatre on Wednesday last, the effect produced on the Audience of that E\euing
may sufficiently speak. No impression could have been more forcible: no applause
. ' •
more genuine, or perfect.

The Opera commence* at the tins of the approaching Sacrifice, when the name* of all the Thracian Virgin*, are ordered to be placed in an Urn, from which the victim in to ba Aaira by lot. Cleanthes, a Thracian nobleman, agitated by fear for his daughter, Diroe, reproaches the King with sending his own daughters away, to save them from the hazard of the Urn; and I>cm«ph«on, irritated at his boldness, orders Birce to be sacrificed, without waiting for it* decision.
Dirce is the wife of Tintanthes, who is believed to be the ablest ron of Demophoon. But as the Thracian laws ordain death to any subject who weds with royal blood, their union is kept secret, Demophooo, sending for Timanthes from the camp, destines him to marry Lysia, Princess of Phrygia, who has been conducted to Thrace by Cherintbns, Demopboon’s youngest sou. Tiamnthes learning the danger of Dirce, betrays his passion to his father, by bis earnest entreaties in her behalf, and her fete, ia consequence, becomes more inevitable. Timaathe*, in despair, then attacks the Guards conducting Dirca, and sets her free, but yields when he meets hit father, overcome by his reproaches. Dirce is about to be sacrificed, when Timanthes confesses their hwrriag«, and they am both condemned to die, by the violated law. Demophoon, however, overcome by the entreaties of Lysia and Cherinthus, cunt Ate to save them both and acknowledge Diree his danghtcr. In the midst of joy Timeathas is struck with horror by receiving a paper from Cleanthes, which proves Dirce to be	daughter of Demophoon; he easts
her from him, bat is restored to happiness £y ^covering from another document, that he himself is the son of Cleanthes, and the " lnnoeent Usurper” alluded to by the Oracle.

PROGRAMMÉ: ^)f the OPSORA.
The kingdom of Thrace having incurred the wrath of Apollo, had been compelled by the God, yearly to immolate a Virgin on his altar. Bemophoon, the King\ having con-suited the Oracle as to the means of averting this sacrifice, received the following answer;
H Hear en s wrath shall cease, when to him-is known
“ The innocent usurper of a throne ! ”
The Opera commences at the time nf the approaching Sacrifice, when the names of all the Thracian Virgins, are ordered to be placed in an Urn, from which the victim is to be drawn by lot. Cleanthes, a Thracian nobleman, agitated by fear for his daughter, Dirce reproaches the King with sending h‘s own daughters away, to save them from the hazard of the Urn ; and Demophoon, irritated at his boldness, orders Dirce to be sacrificed, without waiting tor its decision.
Dirce is the wife oi' Timanthes, who is believed to be the eldest son of Dcmopheou. But as the Thracian laws ordain death to any subject who w eds with royal blood, their union is kept secret, Ucmophoon, sending for Timanthes from the camp, destines him fo marry Lysia, Princess of Phrygia, w ho has been conducted -to Thrace by Cheriuthus, Demophoon’s youngest son. Ti.nanthes learning the danger of Dirce, betrays his passion to his father, by his earnest entreaties in her behalf, and her fate, in consequence, becomes more inevitable. Timanthes, in despair, then attacks the Guards conducting Dircc, and sets her free, but yields when he meets his father, overcome by his reproaches. Dirce is about to be sacrificed, when Tiimanthes confesses their marriage, and they are both condemned to die, by the violated law. Demophoon, heweve -, overcome by the entreaties of Lysia and Cherinthus, consents to save them both and acknow ledge Diree his daughter. In the midst of joy Timanthes is struck with horror by receiving a paper from Cleanthes, which proves Dirce to be the daughter of Uemophoon ; he casts her from him, but is restored to happiness by discovering from another document,-that he himself is the son of Cleanthes, and the “ Innocent Usurper" allcded to by the Oracle.	-
Apollo’s wrath ceases, the dreadful sacrifice is abolished, and Cherinthus new the Hcii of Thrace espouses Lys:a.
