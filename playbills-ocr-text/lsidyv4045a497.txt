sublime and beautiful spectacle.
A Comet will descend in a parabolic curve, from the top of the machine, progressively accelerated in its approach

may have been obtain'd is too slight for acknowledgment.

THEATRE,

HAYMARKET.—The

late comp.-ry

of

Drnry-lane commenced tlieir performances at this Theatre
last night, with the Comedy of The Poor .Gentleman.
The principal actors were received with grrat favour on
their successive appearance. McsD-EN as Sir Rolert
Bramble, was honoured with long applause, and R A C as
Frederick, R D S S E I . US Ollapod,"Mrs. O a c E R as Eirili/,
.and Mrs. SeARKS as Mi*s Liu-rdkt Mactab received i
frequent marks of approbation during the night. The |
performance was singularly well sustained ; we never
MUN'DEN to greater advantage even in his. most " pt
davs," and the other actors played to him with unusual
spirit. This is demonstration against the larger Theatres.
In the ?>erformaQce of last night, the countenance and
the tone were seen and felt without grimace or vociferation in the actor, and the audience were allowed to enjoy the author's wit without the torture of the unfortunate
person who bore its burden. W e liave no doubt that
the public will have a better opportunity of enjoying true and natural representation in this Theatre
than they could from the same Company in Drurylane.
T h e Company have now tried Comedy, and
have admirably succeeded. Their next effort will exhibit
their powers in Tragedy, and we will yenture to predict,
that K E A N ' S llichaii .will be felt t o be a more striking
effi>/t withiii these walls, th;in in the old gVantic place
of his fortin.es; here his. face will be seen, his vcicc will
be heard, and tire ear.eak>rc to which all ."ctors arc driven
I;, tiie larger Theatres, will be spared to all parties. W e .
heartily wish success to their undertaking. Before the
Play, God tare t/f* King was sung, with the followiug
addition.
But tot iitir -.i-iitef.'. verse

THE.

1 he usual Summer i-crfonuhnecs commenced r\t this
Theatre, List night, with a company selected pi incipaliy
from the Corps Drainaltyue of Cdvcnt-gardon, aixl hs unfortunate rival, Drurv-htnc. The plav proJuce1 upmi the
occasion vyas The Soldier's Daughter, one of the very
worst comedies in the English language ; having neither
humour, incident nor design, while such obvious defects are
attempted to he supplied by an overweening .-lOl-ctntion of j
sciitinicnt which is not wore disgusting to a correct task-,
than {lie coarse and stubborn vulgarity of that part, fro.,1
which tltis wretched Drama doriyes a fortuitous interest. I
The performers, ho-ever, did every thing that could be
expected, in order to give effect to tan.ei.c"*s, and animation to stupidity. The presence of Mrs. F U W I N - , who I
sustained the part of the IVidon C'heeilt/, was greeted liv
the audience with loud applause, and the performance of"
this deserving actress was such as to justify the estimation
in which she has long been held by the public, though
she had to personate a character unworty of her powers,
and inconsistent with our notion&»of female delicatv.
T h e lively Interlude, Lover's Quarrels, followed, and
was excellently' played by the principals, R U S S E L L and ,
Mrs. GlBBS. 1 lie last jierforniance of the night, and not
the least amusing, was a new Farce, which introduceii on j
that evening of torrents, had the appropriate title of frit
Weather.
We understand it to be from the French, and
being of that stock, its remoter origin may lie a cro»s of
the Spanish by the German, fur the French Theatre excoeds ours oulv in the universality ofits plunder.
Judging from the earlier part of the dialogue, wt" should ,
attribute this Farce to CoLMAN, or its wit at leapt to his
revision. There were some very ingenious turns in t!>c
first scenes, but the latter part was bustle wjthont businev,
aiid uitr.gue without interest. . T h e German Baron £u]
the corpse were J'wigi, which, though thev increased the
size of the trunk, swelled it oidv into deformity.
Some
of the brief descriptions, were laughable, at least in the
•nouthsof'theirclevcr reciters. J O N E S plaved well, and Miss
B E A U M O N T exhibited very considerable cleverness. A few
seasons vi.1l probably make her a smart and cfloctirc .Ctltae
<it'the young and the coquettish.

THEATRE.

Tke Comedy of Rtde a Wife aid htm.* a Wife, oak,

a

which in point of wit and dramatic cons.riii.tioM, accords
to Kale with the formal chasteness of the present age,
was |>erformed at this Theatre last night.
T h e part
of Leuti was assigned to Mr. WAKDB, and justice obliges us to say that it could not have been in better
hands. Ihs passed through the gradations of inane acquiescence and helpless submission to tlie will of his
intriguing spouse in a manner that called forth the loud
plaudits of the house; while ho succeeded, even with
still greater effect, in those scenes where idiotcy gives
place to sense, and abject compliance to dign-hed o p position.
Yet, much as we were pleased with his
acting last night, we cannot help, at the same time, censuring it as wanting that quality which be obviously anusnt,
distinctness of ii.ij.Tcj*,ioi). His voice, which be docs
not appear to tike sufficient pains to modulate, is always
kept on a key too high for varied harinonv, and there is,
besides, an artificial harshness given to it bv a studied
affectation of guttural solemnity. These defects, however, we are persuaded a better taste will lead him to correct, and we art, the more anxious that he should do «J,
1
because we thn.k him an a c o r of very grc.it promise.
Mrs. C O N s o u uojmtted herself with great success in the
part of Margaritta ; and Jos - Bis as the Copper Captam,
and Mrs. E D W I N , ns Estifania, were both good.

Tm

Pvzxied; or, TArcc /o o»n?, was repeated last night. It
seems to have gained ground since its first exhibition, and
are disposed to think, tl&t if sufficiently curtailed, for
0 we
it has the fault of prolixity, it may -till enjoy a moderate
iength of life, according to the present average of dramatic
: existence. LISTON'S comic song, which inculcates the
doctrine of guarding noses, was irresistibly ludierdus. His
illustration of the fine Roman profile, bv pointing to his
own face, or ratlier to tliat foature of it which his lecture
was intended to benefit, are\> down bursts of laughterThe scene in which lie and RUSSEL appear in petticoats
was again the most effective. We repeat, that with proper ..ttention to brevity, the fine acting by which the
piece is supported, may suece-.-d ia disappointing the
ajipnchensipns at first eatfrtAineo for its succoss. The
comic strength of the Company is adequate, in our opinion, to mo.-:, difficult undertakings than the salvation of
t such a Farce. ( a'

delivered:
I.Mines AND GiSTLT.Mr.i,—On t i n . evening we close our !abour. tor the present Mimnicr. 1 come, d i l u t e d by the .Proprietors to oUcr ycu t.ietr warm and gratefulacknov, leugments for the
.cry kind support with which you have encouraged their huinl.1-'
Wit anxious efforts to provide for your entertainment during tnis
very circumscribed season—.tib.-, alas! so circumscribed . 3 scarcely
to permit u* to set the Wheels even of so ' m a l l , theatrical machine
as this fully and fairty in motion : the current of mirth is were
scarcely suffered to How freety and twit y6u pleasantly along t u tor*: it is stopped by those migbuer powers, before whose «tr«i,|.,.1i
our weakness must give way, and by whose control over histrionic
talent, by their extending the period ot their performance, the
Havmarketseason is BOW reduced to little more than a name.
Whether «.c may one more season meet under this old and favours, roof is uncertain; bittby the graciousfaVotir of the CVwii, j
the proprietors confidently trust that it »ill not be long before
their exei tioii*. to receive sou iu a theatre more commodious and
appropriate^nay be crowned with smxi ss, at the rime time tiypy
beg to assure you, that in t-ieir endeavours to merit the pru'ection
of thei-;..e«i.rous benefactors, they will be ans.oui to preserve in
, their f>mire arrangements all those established feelings of comfort
r^trfffsociafoility xi loog united with this playhouse, a n d will ren»m...»r that \o bo heard and t*. b*. seen are most essenti.ll to dra»ii:u c rtjjf*filiation : they assure you that the back rovf of the
galleries .shall here still be ahle to participate with the front of the
tat in the wijoymeat of our mirth without the aid of hearing trumpets, anil that the most distant spectators shall here never have
occasion to wMi their opera-classes converted into telescopes.
In short, it is their intention that this shall still be the Little
Theatre in rlie Haymarket, where mirth and good humour may
• ttnd tttcmselve.. at their suug and native home.
once mure, I.adies and tientlemen, suiter me to return you the
grateful and heartfelt thanks of the proprietor., lor your ltberal
j swp]Hirt, and to add those ofttie Performers, assuring you that we
are all most truly seiis;*..k 'if y.mr kindness. 1 res^-ectfully bid

(Author of the Siege of

Has the honor of announcing to his Friends and the Public, that the Tragedy of

MACBETH
Will be Performed at this Theatre

On W E D N E S D A Y , May 10, 1820,
In which he will make his First Appearance

In the Character qf 'Macbeth,
For the purpose of pointing out an erroneous construction of a Passage in this great A u thor, Which the above mentioned justly admired Actors have fallen into. The various
Readings given to the different Texts of Shakspeare, have perpetually furnished subjects of
controversy, and will ever be a subject of interest to all Persons of taste and literature.—
M r . F I T Z G E R A L D has not been induced to undertake this task, from an arrogant desire
to display talents not yet called into public action, but from a conviction that each individual
•who adds an additional ray to the lustre of Shakspeare's name, contributes his mite to the
cause of Scenic Art and Dramatic Literature! Anxious to render the Performance more worthy
of public patronage, he has engaged

Miss MACAULEY,
Who will make her First Appearance in Public since her late severe Illness, in the Character of

LADY

MACBETH.

IIAYM-V.tKE.T.
T h e Beg*ar''$ Opera was produced on Saturd.iv
evening with most powerful attraction. T h e .V-vcAca/A of Madame Ves-Hts, charmed by the D*elitN£M
of her action, t h e prettiness of her face and figure
in male attiie, and by tlie depth and richness of her
melodious voice. T h e new Polly completely r e doubled the charm of the Opera : she is p. idei.tlv
quite IIRW ti> t h e stage, and through all the timid
embarrassm.'iit of w;.'tt.'i...d iuexpeiirnce, . b o w e d a
natural .•tensibility., teste, aiid I ruth of expression, b e yond any lir-t apprarmnip we (ver witnessed.
Her
voice is a bcuuli f u. soprano, po.sses^ing the rare a r .
compauimciit of being most powerful and musical i n
h»r lower upecs. Her'stylu <•.'••.lining Is excellent, a n d
evinces the souiiiiiica.tce of the.MtriM.ltn which she h a s
bpen edocated. '.fheretl s i.veetiiess w hich winds and
slides into the h e a r t , and rivets the attention ; while
the evident possession of power ajid skill to execute
any thing which music may require, is as evidently
under the regulation of good judgment and delirnte
taste. W e look forward t o her future eminence as
\ . . one of the most fascinating ornaments of which t h e
English Opera has ever had to boast. AV'e never
heard the celebrated air of '* Cease your
funning"
sung with more sweetness or with greater effect—it
was giren in t h e original k e y , which no Polly in
o u r remembrance has ever d o n e , it being t o o high
for most voices ; it was rapturously and most d e servedly encored.
T h i s , and " When my hero in
Court appeari"
which was sweetly acted, were, in
o u r opinion, specimens of the greatest purity and
power of musical expression.
When to Uiis t-o-etiy of .tenictio.. we odd ike -.rjn/r ca« of
the other rh.tr..rte-», filled hy performrrs nf hij»l. repiiniioi., it
is n«dlcs< l« «ay how complete the HtlT.Mt.fH) «f tbi- Open.
niil.t prove. We mi.**, howevr, distingui-h the perfect repre.eiitiiii.ii of .f.m-y by M«s. C KEUBLE. where iririh. vigour, and
i-.emity, in Ihe pemuiifieaiion of the psoler's daughter, « r .
nueqa.tllH is the « W " ratine of «;«-nic pun raiti. res; but tin.
' Lady's roti-siim-i-are art needs no addiiinnal praise at ihe presrat' day. The House literally overU<iwrd, nod by Ihn
rapt'irons .alhr.*rii~.ejprr''ed
from all i|*ar.rrs, piomise. lu

A'.Etr HAYZIARKET

THEATRE.

This elegant Tlieatre opened last night for its brief season with every prospect of success. I n t h e HEKAI.O of yesterday there were ample descriptions of the interior of t h e
building, t o which t h e limitation of our space and t h e lateness of the hour compel us to refer t h e reader A n occasional
Address was delivered by M r . TEKRY before t h e commencement of t h e Comedy, which, however, depended much
more for its effect on his eneigetic delivery, than upon its
own intrinsic merit. I t was received with great applause.
The Comedy was The Rivals; a judicious selection, and one
that promises well for t h e good taste of the M a n a g e m e n t .
With t h e exception of Mr. DF.CAM?, as Captain
Absolute,
who is well known to t h e town, we have not much t o say
in praise of t h e fresh performers.
This Gentleman is
a lively actor, a n d his appearance is r a t h e r in hi3
favour.
Lyilia
Languish
was represented by M r s .
J O H N S O N . She might make a good Hoyden, but for characters of this kind her day is past. M i s . PEAMCE, who performed a few nights a t the old Theatre last season, maintained t h e honours of Mrs. Malayrop, in the most successful
manner.
A M r . T A \ U U H E , from Liverpool, made
his debut in Acres.
H e fatls short of all his predecessors that we have seen in t h e character—though ha excited
some latigfiter. M r . W A R D , from Dublin, was a respectable S i r Lucius O'Trigger.
Ot T E K K T ' S Sir
Anthony
we need only say that it was in his best st.,le. A vaudeville
Opera, called Pettr and Paul, or Lore in the Kineyurds,
concluded the entertainments of the evening.—It is a merry
little piece, though, perhaps, it betrays too much of its
French origin. A party seemed to have come to the house
to extinguish it, for they began to hi-,s before it was possible
to form a y j u d g m e n t of its merits. I t went t h r o u g h t h e
ordeal, however, and promises to please, at least for » few
nights—an a g e in the oaler.dar of this T h e a t r e . T h e house
was well filled, and presented, altogether, a new and very
cheerful aspect.

IT

HAYMARKKT-THBATRE.—Last night The Pro''
', yoked Hviband mat pe.-furD.ed. Tile excellence of the Cot-Ms, IS
I favourable to the Actor, and few can utterly fail in its -striking
and forcible dialogue; but even this excellent') makes, the public
taste more fastidious, and the Actor, to be applauded, must have
peculiar deservings. Mr. CO*WAT was Lord Tuwnly. It is
some years since this performer has appeared in .London, and
those years have, we believe, been given up to a vigorous study
of ihe Stage. He has profited by tbem. His action is more
finished, bis ncitation more exact, and his general conception
obviously more rapid, clear, and natural- There was much bold
picturing of character in the early scenes; and the Anal interview
with Lady Ibirn/t/.jthe manly indignation, and thesuduen return
of fondnrss and forgiveness were admirably contrasted. Mr.
CONWAT was frequently applauded. Mrs. CHAtrE*u.r was the
Lady, and her performance exhibited mu ji. tenderness. Tint
Way was altogether extremely wall received.

THEATRE.

A numeroui and respectable audience attended this
Theatre, on Saturday night, when a pel former named LEONI
L..K made his second appearance as Henry tiertratn, in the
Opera of Guy Mannering. Hi* voice is deficient iu compass, and incapable of bold or brilliant execution, but it is
very street and pleasing, particularly in the under tones. He
b. very far from having acquired tbat proficiency in his art
which bespeaks a conect taste, yet he certainly evinces
powers that are susceptible of improvement, and he would
do well not to affect Mr, BKAHAM'S style before he has made
himself master of the principles upon which it is formed. A
great part of the audience appeared evidently prepossessed
in his favour, and one or two of his songs we.e encored.—
Miu CAKEW, as Lucy Bertram, was all that could be desired, aiid Dandle Dinmont found a worthy representative
in Mr. J. RUSSELL, who acquitted himself to the entire satisfaction of the audience. Tue other character, weie, for the
moat part, very well sustained.

THEATRE.

The principal performance yt-sterday evening was COLMAS'S interesting and humorous Comedy ef the Heir at Lute,
which, notwithstanding the (indue portion of pa'hetie sentiment infused into it by the ingenious author, will always
rani: among those sterling pieces that are destined to keep
j possession of the English stage.—Indeed, it may be said of
' him, as well as of CUMUEKI.AVO, that, in writing his plays,
he has been guided more by the prevailing taste and fashion
of the age than the correctness of his own judgment. This,
however, must he said of COLMAV, tbat although he has departed from the old English school of airiness, fun, and
gaiety, his scenes of distress and tenderness never oppress
the mind by melancholy. Like transient clouds, they pass
away quickly, nnd leave a clear atmosphere for returning ^ „ ^ - " ^..^
J sun-shine to gladden the hearts of the audience. With regard
• to the performance, it was altogether as complete as any we .
have ever witnessed. When we saw in the bills the name of Mr.
TcRRT.u the person who was to play Dr. Patiglot*,&nd recollected the great difference between him and Mr.FAWCErr,who
had already gained so much applause in that character, we entertained some apprt nensions for his success ; but we were
agreeably disappointed. There was indeed much solemnity
in hit delineation ; but it was the mock-solemnity intended
by the author ; and there was sufficient burlesque and servility in the representation to render the character delightfully contemptible. The Daniel Dowlas of Mr. WILLIAMS
was a correct and natural performance, ai was the Dt/iorah
Dowiut of Mri.Psa.CE. They were both extremely happy
in their affectation of vulgar importance, on their sudden
elevation from the chandler's shop to the rank of Nobility.
Dick Doubt was performed by Mr. LACY with considerable
animation and justness of conception. This actor fs quite
new to the London boards, but he has proved himself capable of displaying the unprincipled fop and the benevolent
line gentleman with equal success. But the most finished,
because the most difficult piece of acting in the whole, was
WH 82iM
the Zekiel Homttpun of Mr. J. Remus.. He not only
proved himself master of the rustic dialect, but master of that
blunt, honest-hearted generosity, which is often to be found
among the rustics of England. There was energy and imprcssiveness in every thing he said and did, while in no instance did he attempt to rise out of the natural and rude simplicity of the individual he personated. The whole performance was loudly applauded. At the end of the play, the
original and very humorous epilogue was spoken by all the
characters.

A new Comedy was produced at this Theatre, on Saturday evening, under the title of Hise and fall, with complete
~TT JMf"
success. The following U a sketch «t the pldt:—Sir " . . . s ^
J&
VA-..*.-.V
V. V iiihm Traffic, (Mr. WILLIAMS) a rich and adventurous spe- ^ ^ I
cnlatnr.anivrs with his niece, Mitt Traffic (Mr».TAVL,.v»j.),
f4fh\,%M»Vl I N u . < v w
at his splendid villa, in the highest style of mercantile magand are requested to patronize the intended mar,\
• nificence,
riage of Hose (Mrs* C a f r n j n * , ! , thair head gardener's
daughter, with Sensitive (Mr. JONES,1, a worthy and welleducated yuung man, iu reduced circumstances, through
the misfortune" of a deceased patent, The wealthy Rarot)t)0"
net and his niece treat their dependents with a considerable
degree of hauteur, and object to a marriage not originally
•'• arranged under their auspices, when they r^euive ua eiecH. S
trical shock in the news of a continental failure involving
" them in sudden poverty, and the necessity of selling their
estates. On the other hand, the unassuming village school',
master, Sensitive, becomes as unexpectedly the possessor of _
. ,.^_.
(
*\
an immense income, which enables him (« purchRse the Uaronet's domain ; and a number of whimsical incidents are
elicited from the rise of one family and fall of the other.—
Semitiae, in spite of every temptation laid out for him, remains tt .ie to the humble Hose, and promises to assist Ids
friend Tramples {Mr. TKS.Y), an eccentric literaly wanderer, in the service of the periodical press, with a targe
*-,"v V
sum of OMWL wlieu a codicil is discovered to the
his benefactor, Sir Ho/iert (Mr. You Mi-H.), which restrict.
A •!
him from marrying for three years, or from lending any sum
. » * ^ ^ ' * ~ * ' ' a b , r e five pounds. While perplexed with these unlookedfor drawbacks, it is discovered that the testatbris jet living,
having been shipwrecked and supposed lost, but preserved
providentially on his passage from the indies; and th.;
failure of Sir Omniani's agent turns out to be a fabrication,
^""•'
made with an intention to cure him of a dangerous partia-,.
'f
.
»—r
Tity for hazardous speculation. Sensitive, however, is equally* l -* ~
. 8 1 . vi
well provided for during his patron's life, marries his dear \
I
?l\\A
Hose, and all parties are rendered contested with each other".
This piece, though it will not rank among the higher pro.
daction- of the comic genius of the country, is superior m
many important particulars to the mass of modern drama.
<\iVV \ - . u \ .
which affect to give a picture of manners. There is no great
invention shown in the plot, and not much original power
- ,''•>';, [• displayed in the characters. But the story is developed
, . ,
—- ^ .
_
with the art of one who has very clearly discerned the source.
. ywi
of dramatic effect. The incidents arise easily and naturally,
gr ""Jandthe equivoques are generally carried on without, sacri- . I
r
ficing any thing to probability either in the actions or the
R.-.» . JL . a . k • . V.
expressions of the characters that are involved in it. We
» .
w
thought, however, that the scene which immediately follows
the wrong delireiy uf the letters by Sensitive might receive
! .lW
•>f.i.W.'
a little retouching. Mr. Plausible appeared to us to take too
much pains .to bear out the deception. We own that vre ' - •
were led to expect a very amusing affair at " t h e little glen."
The meeting of the different par ties under the circumstances
'
in which they mutually stood, might, in the hands of this
__
author, be rendered a very agreeable substitute for the t,nne
and ineffective deivmement by which the perplejtitv is at J ^ T h I
d \ * <' '
present cleared up. Perhaps the scene in the Hirtls may
.jK.!!.
v j
,
iiare deterred him from the undertaking.
The dia.(...
logne is maintained throughout in the very happiest spirit.
It is the elevated conversation of the gentlemen and In'!
the elder drama, and it is occasionally lightened with the
flashes of a power nhieli we thought had slept with the
( • Muse of SUT.KII.AN. Mr. Tgiikv, iu the part of thelitcraiy
' adventurer, has far less to ilo than ought to have been provided for him. We speak with professional bias, perhaps,
for we find that be is a contributor to the daily press. Hut
Trumpljy says some very pointed things which drew down
very hearty applause. It must be admitted, however, that
he is under deep obligation to his predecessor .Itr. I'ujf'.
(A Mr. JONES'S representation of Seniitice it is impossible
jhly. The who'e weight of the piece was
• gathered upon nins, ant it is im. little praio to s y Hint he
. •
•bowed himself in evirj respect capable ofduly
'it.
Mr. OMJI.HHV made a good deal i,t the Lou ij?r A trtnch
ai
I. —.
Va'et was performed by Mr. DRCAMI* with justness ami Hi •
crimination. Rut we cannot commend the song which he
,
iff
ttunccessarily introduced, 01 the repetition of it in defiance of
so mui h opposition. Mrs. CHAITE.LKT played with the
prettiest rustic simplicity, and Mr. ratl.Xv.-a infused a good
deal of humour into the inconsiderable character ol the
01
Hardener. The scenery is remarkably tine. With the
merits which we have noticed, and with the auppmt <>f the
'
.• ' ' •
best acting, it is not surprising that th s piece met with must
triumphant success. It has received the verdict of the ir.o t
crowded house we have witnessed during the sewson. ft
was announced for repetition every night till f.rtucr notice •

NEW T H E A T H E , H A Y M A R K E T .
A new Play, in three acts, was last night I
tirought out at this Theatre, under the title
frf Match-Breaking;
or, A Prince's Present.—
The plot, if not almost the whole of the piece,
* decidedly of foreign extraction; and we are of
Jpinion, that of the same materials about two
J-ears ago, a petite piece was composed in Paris,
and presented at the Theatre L'Odeon.
The character of the piece is rather serious '
throughout. The scene is laid in one of those ;
petty arbitrary state*, which once so degraded the
political Geography of the Germ-n Empire. The
lover appears to have been early left an orphan by
the untimely death of his father in the field of battle,
lnd brought up to the military profession by the
cind interposition of the reigning Prince. He becomes acquainted with the interesting and beautiful
leice of a family, consisting of three brothers, and
i sister, who, notwithstanding, they profess themselves warm advocates for liberal political senti- '
nents, and revolutionary improvement, most incon- j
•latently betray an overweaning hankering after
titled connexion and preferment at Court. What.
sver humour is in the piece, arises out of this
wtre combination of opposite principles in the
nembers of this aristo-democratic family. This
ostentation of liberal sentiments, at one moment,
and trimiring complacency with the arbitrary interposition of the Prince as to the disposal of
their niece iu marriage, at another, humourously ,

, man school in thepart, which it would be well to
i curtail. But the weight of the piece fell upon
that deservedly popular actor JONES, whose delineation of the radical coxcomb, Solomon, vapouring about his success at Court, and amongst
the women, his political integrity, and sapient discrimination in affairs of State and Court intrigue,
drew down reiterated applause and laughter. There
were not wanting passages to call foith an expression of applause tinctured with political feeling, and we were happy to perceive, that with
the exception of one solitary one, those which excited that expression were decidedly of a loyal
character. The tediousness of the piece (for it decidedly is too long) was occasionally relieved by a
song from Miss R. CORRI in good taste, who
played in a sort of love underplot die character of the heroine's maid.
The overture was
applauded, and is the composition of Mr. M.
CORRT. At the conclusion of the piece, which was
well received throughout, it was announced for repetition every evening by Mr. TERRY, amid-t a } . ,
deafening tumult of applause. The house was
Crowded in every part. The prologue, spoken by
Mr. T E R R Y , was extremely well received, and the
passage alluding to the late joyous and cordial reception of his MAJESTY in Ireland, was loudly applauded. At the falling of the curtain the audience
evidently waited a considerable time in expectation
of an epilogue, in which, however, they were disappointed. The piece is from the pen of Mr. KENNY,
a gentleman deservedly popular as a dramatic writer.
The prologue, by a friend, is subjoined.

The Germnn family of D e Strom berg, who are rather dislayal
£i their convention and sentiments, have betrothed their niece
btrnna to Edgar, a Captain in the Prince's Guard, Edgar, I
lo-ever, n a » great reason to be jealous of the Prince himself,
•ho cornea into the family in the disguise of bis relation Hoffnan, a Professor of Philosophy. A t the momeBt of signing the
ontract, the supposed Protestor suggests the necessity of the
- r.nce s written consent to the marriage, but the Baroness and
• ' ***?* Brothers De Stromberg, in a lofty and satirical asseri ° a of their independence, spurn the idea, and insist on pro*-™i|5. At the critical moment, a present arrives from the
l-ruice, conveyed by one of his Pages, to Emma, with a com-umentary inscription—this produces a sudden change. T h e
amily are astonished, the contract is suspended, and the Independents are suddenly seized with thr- hope of marrying Emma
o the Prince himself. The younger brother, Solomon, an
•mpty self-sufficient coxcomb, who is constantly buzzing about
he Court, with an affectation of despising it, is sent in search of
mormation. The Professor Hoffman has written against the
~f*J'?e' an< * t o t n e supposed Professor Solomon is very free
t h i s satire and invectives against Government The Prince,
"ho has in fact been struck with a passionate admirati.n
i ,ruram*>
becomes, in the course of his visits, incognito,
tilt more enamoured of the simplicity and purity of her
eart, and the jealousy of JEdgar is exasperated to the highest
r.? r W u Ever7 appearance increases the hopes of the family.
SeBds notlce
m'nCe
->•" a public visit; at this moment
n officer arrives in the family to arrest the supposed Proessor for his writings against the Prince. The family are in
he greatest alarm, and immediately determine on turning the
rofessor out, that h e may not be found in their house. The
rinoe s arrival is announced, and at the moment they should
welcome, they are bent on removing him in his assumed chaacter. At this point he discovers himself, joins the lovers, exresses a good humoured retort on the apostate Malcontents,
fhorn he freely forgives, and the curtain falls.

The part of the enamoured officer was performed
<y DECAMP, that of the Prince by TERRY, who is

ot exactly fitted to play the lover. The great
.elect in this very useful actor is his forced and unlatural delivery of every common passage in his
Vuthor—
" I n monosyllables his thunders roll,
And he, she, it, and they, affright the soul."

p

lis whole declamation is one unvarying, forceful,
nictation of harsh sounds. Mrs. CHATTERLY
flayed the heroine extremely well, although there
s much sermonising, after the manner of the Ger-

PROLOGUE.
While Coronation, magic title, fills.
Of Winter Theatres, the summer bills,
H o w could we hope on this our humble stage
With those great Monarchs mighty war to wage ?
H e r e no procession lures thn wondering eye,
Dukes, Bishops, Peers, and Clerks in Chancery;
N o charger here, amongst ye sideling wheels,
Threat'ning j o u r noses with his playful heels;
Yet indefatigably still we use
The means we have, and call upon the Muse ;
And may these loyal signs to-night prevail
In favour of a light and loyal tale !
We have our Prince too, as the fashion goes;
L e t him make friends, nor meet with stubborn foes.
Good humour guides us, and good humour here
Cheats many a trembling author of his fear.
And tho' no pageant train, or glittering crown
Assist our Prince's hopes, of fair renown,
Yet may good humour there (the Boxrs) his Champion sit,
Or ride triumphant thro' a generous Pit:—
This for our Play. For us wko are denied,
To grace our honest aeal with scenic pride.
L e t me in good round terms, our hearts display,
And what we freely feel aa freely say,
] n this, as in our gallant Sister land,
May good old feelings every shock withstand,
Hush civil strife, from faction pluck her sting,
And loyal Subjects make a Patriot King.
