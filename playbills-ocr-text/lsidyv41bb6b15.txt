PROGRAMME.—This representation is calculated to inspire the young and uncultivated mind
with a proper horror for Vice, and paints, in the most lively colours, the disgrace and punishment
that always attend on Guilt.—This very singular performance commences with Juan's endeavour to
seduce the Commandant's daughter.—In disguise, he slays her lover, and murders the Commandant,
after which he escapes to Sea.—A Vessel, in- which is Don Juan and his man Scaramouch, is seen
crossing the Ocean, when in a violent Storm she becomes a complete wreck, and Juan is cast on shore
faint and near expiring, when two Fisherwomen.pitying his situation, kindly support him to their
Cot.—Scaramouch is now seen swimming over the waves, and is assisted by two Sailors.—Juan, now
recovered, still perseveres in his wickedness ; he seduces the Fisherwomen, and shoots one of their
husbands. ACT 2 commences with Juan returned to the city, and a view of the Statue of the murdered Commandant, mounted on a Pedestal, underneath which, is the following inscription: "To the
Memory of the late Commandant," where he beholds these words in letters of BLOOD! i
"By thee I Jell, thyjate's decreed:—Heaven will avenge the bloody deed"
Fearless, he looks upon the Statue, nodding as it were, with horror, on such monstrous wickedness;
Scaramouch, seeing it, terrified at such a phenomenon, informs his master, who in disdain, challenge*
the Statue to give him the meeting at a Banquet, where he next appears in a scene of dissipation and
riot.—Dreadful and uncommon noises surround the tavern, all is thrown into confusion, and the
Statue entering, seats itself opposite to Don Juan at table, who, with unprecedented daring, asks it
to eat,—The Statue (after inviting Juan to sup with him at 12 o'clock, in the plaae where his
murdered remains lie) goes off, and he, after a moment's reflection, follows it into a dismal cave, with
monuments, bones, &c. where an awful scene of expostulation takes place; the Ghost, rinding him,
determined not to repent, seizes him, and throws him on the ground.—Fear and remorse strike him,
he trie* every possible means of escape, but in vain.—Furies continually meeting at every turn, be
frills on the ground, and disappears amidst SHO

On THURSDAY, August the 2nd, 1827,
Will be performed the popular and interesting Melo-Drame called

THE

MYSTERIOUS

MURDER.

Tbis Piece is taken from the celebrated Novel of "Caleb Williams, or Things as they Are,"
finch' pnurtraving the character of Sir Edward Mortimer, whose conscience, from the recollection ol the murder he has committed,is become a hellto him; but -whose life, setting aside tbis
horrid deed, was so unspotted, that when at the awful Tribunal of Justice he was pleading his
defence, tbe over-thronged Court distributed cool Justice in her Judgment-seat, by shouting
"Innocence" ere he had finished: the Court acquitted him, and the multitude bore him in triumph home. But, alas! though he escaped the Vigilance of Justice, his high sense of honour
could Never reconcile him to the disgrace of being arraigned in open Court upon a charge of
Murder, and tbe perpetual gnawings of his conscience rendered bim at length so fretful, suspicious, and t)rannical. that he could enjoy no moment of repose. At length he took an opportunity of unbosoming himself to Wilford, his secretary, a youth whose curiosity had led him to
prv into his Master's every look and action, and by his conduct had laid himself open to his
cinfidence; and Sir Edward at once, after binding 1 he youth by the most horrid oaths, confesses
to him the narrative ofthe Murder, but from tbat hour dreads and abhors the sight of bim.—
Feariug be should betray tbe fatal secret, he blackens his character by accusing bim of robbing
him and so artfully contrives it, as to have several articles of value, which had lain in bis
I R O N C H E S T , placed in Wilford's box. But what can elude the all-seeing eye of Providence, tbat will not suffer the guilty to escape, ner innocence to go unrewarded?—Sir Edward
h»dheedlessly conveyed into the box, with other articles, the very knife with which he committed
the Murder, and a written narrative of the fact. Thus known to the world for a Murderer and
an Assassin, be never more raised his bead, but in a state of madness and agonizing torture, fell
a dreadful example to all around him.

END OF T H E PLAY,

A FANCY DANCE BY MISS VAUSE.
The whole to conclude with a New Pantomimic Ballet Spectacle, never acted here, called

PITCAIRN'S

ISLAND.
With New Scenery, Machinery, Dresses, and Decorations.

This interesting Ballet is founded on the Discovery of the Descendants of the Mutineers of His Majesty's Shr,
Bounty, on an Island in the South Seas.
As the real position was ascertained by the Captain of the Briton in 1814, to be far distant from that which
i» usually laid down in the Charts, and as he considered it uninhabited, he was not a little surprised on approaching
its shores to behold Plantations regularly laid out, and huts or houses neatly constructed.—When about two mi lee
from the shore, some natives were observed bringing down their Canoes on their shoulders, dashing through the surf,
Mid paddling to the Ship; but his astonishment was unbounded on hearing one of them, at they approached t h .
Skip, call in the English Language, "Won't you heave us a R.pe now >" They proved to be the descendants ef tks
deluded crew of the Bounty, being once a.sured that this visit was of a peaceable nature, it is impossible to describe
the joy these people manifested on seeing those whom they were pleased to consider as their countrymen.

On MONDAY Evening, August 13th, 1827,
Will be performsd the much-admired Drama (from Sir W. Scott's Works; called T H E

Mermaid's Well;
OR, THE

BRIDE OF LAMMERMOOR.
T o those wlio have read the beautiful Works entitled "Tales of my Landlord,"
any remarks
on the merit they possess are superfluous j but as this is not a general case, a few hints may not
be considered unnecessary.—In the present Drama Ihe adapter has followed his great master in a
regular and strict manner, and has not lost a single iota of the beauty of the original. T h e c h a r acters are all highly d r a w n , and in particular those of the Master of Ravenswood and Lucy Ashton,
which are powerful, impressive, and effective; and the concluding scene of the Piece is a perfect
Ne Plus Ultra of dramatic power ! T h e character of Caleb Ralderstone is a genuine specimen of
the truly honest, feeling, faithful, r.nd affectionate old Scottish domestic, who supports (through a
train of difficulties and misfortunes) the honour of the noble family he has served through a long
life, and whom no reverse of fortune can s h a k e or alter.

MR. J E F F E R S O N
Has the honor to announce to the Public, that his BENEFIT

is fixed for

TUESDAY Evening, August the 14th, 1827,
When will be periormed an Historical Melo-Drame taken from

MACBETH
The Author of this Drama was not more remarkable for the dignity of his characters, the
strength of his expressions, the elevation of his sentiments, and the natural beauty of his imagery, than for the happy choice of his subjects. I n this excellent Tragedy he is more regular
thin in many of his pieces. I t records an important point in the history of Scotland, \iz. the
acquisition of the crown by Macbeth, who was then Commander-in-chief ol King Duncan's arm;.—The Witches meeting Macbeth and Banquo on the blasted heath, on their return from the
battle of Fife, where the Norwegian army was totally defeated.
Likewise the ambiguous manner of foretelling his future honours—The cruel means by
which he gained them—The murder of the King of Scotland at Maebeth's castle—The assassination of Banquo, whose Ghost appears to Macbeth at the grand Coronation Banquet—His
consulting the Witches again, who lead him by their delusions to believe that no man of woman

UTERIOIIT.

Throughout the whole of this celebrated Drama expectation is wrought to the highest pitch: the
perilous situation of Olivia, whoso husband (the Marquis Altieri) excited by his thirst of wealth, forms
the dreadful expedient of murdering, in order that his hopes may be realized by espousing Marcelliua, heiress of the noble House of Vinconza; to this end he employs a Ruffian named Spaladro. to put
the diabolical act into execution—but, touched with pity and remorse for the sufferings of the noble
victim, ho repents his wicked purpose, and under the assumed name of Manfredi, vows t o shield her
from the Machinations and vengeance of her cruel husband, to accomplish which, he engages the aid of
Pedro, an honest Fisherman, - b u t notwithstanding their precautions, the retreat of Olivia is discovered, and, but for the timely interposition of Mnufredi, her destruction completed. In this eventful crisis
lie contrives ber escape, arrives himself at the castle, and by his mysterious appearance interrupts the
nuptial rites of Altieri and Marccllina. Mis bold and menacing deportment creates the greatest terror
in the mind of Altieri, who is warned by him not to proceed in his hellish design. Unmindful of this
caution, he employs the Banditti to seize the hapless Olivia—but Providence, over watchful over innocence, averts their plans, and hurls destruction on her base oppressors.

On MONDAY Evening, April 14th, 1828,
Will be produced (first time here) a New Melo-Drainatic Piece called

THIRTY YEARS OF

A Gambler's Life;
Or9 The Hut of the Red

JHountain.

Tata Piece, Uken from real life, and which has since the middle of June been nightly represented to crowded audieneat,
at the Theatre Porte St. Martin, in Paris, has excited a stronger sensation in that capital than any Mclo-Brama that has been
produced there for some years. The frightful extent to which the rago of Gaming has spread in that city, and the fatal results
to which it too often lead's, have, apparently, induced tlic highly talented Authored direct the utmost force of hit pen against
that destructive vice; and never, perhaps, have its consequences bcon pourtrayed in so strong a light, nor the wretchedness,
guilt, and despair which arise from it, been so vividly illustrated, as in this Drama. It professes to represent the life of a
Gamoster, but, as it is impossible to present on tUe Stage, in a continual series, the transactions of to long a period, the occurrences of twenty-four hours, at different periods of his life, separated by intervals of lifted! years, constitute each l i t .
Part of the Drama, which, it is confidently anticipated, will be found one of the most powerfully interesting and impr»«iv«
ever transferred from the French to the English Stage.

To conclude with the New Melo-Dramatic Piece called

T H I R T Y YEARS OF A

Gambler's Life
Or, The Hut of the Red

Mountain.

T H I S Piece, taken from real life, and which has since the middle of June been nightly represented to crowded audiences,
at tho Tboatro Porte 8t. Martin, in P u i s , h»s excited a stronger sensation in that capital than any Mclo-Drama that has been
produced there for some years. The frightful extent to which the rage of Gaming has spread in that city, and the fatal results
to which it too often leads, have, appurantlv, induced the highly talented Author to direct the utmost force of his pen against
that destructive vice; and never, perhaps, have its consequences been pnurtrayed in so strong a light, nor the wretchedness
guilt, and despair which arise from it, been so vividly illustrated, as in this Drama. I t professes to represent the lite of a
Gamester, but, as it is impossible to present on the Stage, in a continual series, the transactions of so long a period, the occurrences of twenty-four hours, at different periods of his life, separated by intervals of fifteen years, constitute each Act or
Part of the Drama, which, it is confidently anticipated, will be found ooo of the most powerfully interesting aud impressive
over transferred from the French to tho English Stage.

The whole to conclude with (by desire of numbers from the Country who hate not had an opportunity

THIRTY YEARS OF A

Gambler's Life;
OR, THE HUT OF THE RED

MOUNTAIN.

THIS Piece, taken from real life, and which has since the middle ol June been nightly represented to crowded audience*
at the Theatre Porte St. Martin, in Paris, has excited A stronger sensation in that capital than any Melo-Drama that hasbeen produced there fur some years. The frightful extent to which the rage of Gaming has spread in that city, and the
fatal results to which it too often leads, have apparently induced the highly talented author to direct the utmost force of
his pen against that destructive vice ; and never, perhaps, havo its consequences been pom traced in so strong a light,
nor the wretchedness, guilt, and despair which arise from it, been so vividly illustrated, as in this Drama. It professes
to represent the life of a Gamester, but as it is impossible to present on the Stage, in a continual series, tbo transactions
of so long a period, the occurrences of 24 hours, at different periods of his life, separated by intervals of 15 years, constitute each act or part of the i)ramo, which, it is conlidently anticipated, will be found one of the most powerfully interesting and impressive ever transferred from the French to the English Stage.

crime—re-appearance of Warner reduced to a common beggar—his discovery of the murder—continued
infatuation of the gamblers—arrival of Albert—recognition of his mother—the distresses of the gamester

Round, Grape, and Canister, as will astonish the Upper TForhs of those friends who
lay him alongside. He begs at the same time they will accept his

H E A R T Y GOOD WRSHES
for the prosperity of his native Town the Port of Hull,—that his Shipmates, wherever
bound, may set sail with a Fine Cargo, Fair Wind, and Good Passage.—that they
may never have Short Allowance, Banyan Days, or a Southerly IVind in the Bread
Basket.—never be Hard a fVeather on a Lee Shore, but be always able to Luff up,
and Sjjlice the Main Brace, with Planks well lined, Victualling Office well stored,
plenty of Grog in the Lrcker, and their Weather Eye up.—may they never want a
Good Pilot, but return to Port with Chests well lined with Dollars, to throw in the
wins of Sweethearts and Wives ; and when Grappled in their dear arms, may they
cast anchor in those blessed Moorings for life, and then

Hurrah ! for the Jackets of Blue !
In the course of the Evening, L. S. T. will

Mr. THOMPSON
begs leave a few lines to indite
All his Townsmen and good Friends at Hull to invite,
On MONDAY the 12th day of May,
28,
But stop ! let him first this big blunder set right,
The Day that he means is—

HIS B E N E F I T N I G H T !
When a Treat will be given, he pledges his word,
The best ere yet seen,—no exertion be spared.
The Play over, pray what comes next to the sight ?
You'll ask, I expect, and you're certainly right;
To be brief, we'll

AN OLIO

bring to the view,
0 , Mirth ! pray admit us of thy merry crew.
There'll be Songs sung by ANGEL, and very well too,
And some others by THOMPSON, not Old ones, but New.
And something eise 'tcerry PekooiUr' and nice,
And he'd wish all his Friends to partake of a slice,
But rhey'll all be too late if they wait till Half-Price ;
Yet he promises those, too, a Snack, by the mass,
And they may, if they please, take the fam'd

Laughing

Gas !!!

Mr. THOMPSON has long known the way how to make it.
And will give to whoever disposed is to take it.
Its effect is quite harmless, and but momentary,
And makes you feel afterwards quite light and airy ;
"1 was discovered (I think) by Sir Humphrey Davy,
Or, if not, he has ta'en it, and ne'er cried 'pecavi.'
Next your favour we ask for a maiden, the rather,
Being our Daughter of Fen, and much like her father ;
Who to please you a beautiful Ballad will tryTo ting, and she'll ask if her

" Brooms you will Buy T'
Now, as Author, once more, we your favour would try.
And trust you'll not scan ns with critical eye,
For 'tis only a trifle, and I wish I may Die,
If I dou't hope you'll laugh till you're ready to cry j
My hand shakes while I write, and I'm ready to drop.
While I tremblingly christen my bantling

MISS POP,
Who not long since in Liverpool erst came to light,
And during the Season was played every night,
That is, after my night, when first she appear'd,
And for 19 nights after, most loudly was cheer'd.
Now Ladies aud Gents who want Tickets and Places,
You'll find me in Myton-Gate, pray shew yoor faces.
The Curtain will rise at a quarter past Seven,
And finally down as the Clock goes Eleven.
But 'twould take a whole week to tell all I've to say,
For Partic'lars pray look at the Bills of the Day.

OR, THE UNFORTUNATE APPRENTICE.
W I T H T H E ORIGINAL

EXECUTION

SCENE.

THIS affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising
generation, was founded upon fact. The unfortunate hero of the piece was executed for the
murder of his virtuous and venerable uncle, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to which he was
instigated bj an artful, cruel, and abandoned woman ; step by step she led the unwary youth to
the last cruel deed, which terminated a miserable existence by an ignominious death.
A story is recorded, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a young gentlcman of the city of London, having embezzled part of his master's property, was providentially
at the representation of "George Barnwell" at Drury-Lane.when that admirable actor Mr. Ross
personated the hero, at whose fate he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition
and reformation. The gentleman so benefitted by this excellent tragedy, was not ashamed to
own his obligations to the play and performer, for at ever; subsequent yearly benefit Mr. Ross
received a hundred pounds sterling, with a card to tbe following effect:"
"Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable performance of George Barnwell for
more than lite, for his redeemed honour and credit, begs your acceptance of the enclosed; which
s«m you will receive yearly as long as you continue in yeor profession. Happy am I to acknowledge that the stage has prevented me from ruin and despair; George Barnwell has stopped
me in my mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death.
I am, Sir, your grateful and
obedient Servant,
A CO> VERT."

Will be presented the admired Tragedy of

OR, T H E ROYAL SLAVE.
AT the present moment, when the wanu hearts and enlightened minds of the British Nation are so
zealously endeavouring to annihilate the cruel practice of Slavery, this Tragedy must prove highly acceptable. The horrid custom and its effects are herein most powerfully displayed : and from the beautiful
and poetic language it possesses—the various situations the principals are placed in—the treachery of
their oppressors, contrasted with the resolution and determined support of their friends—form a climax
of deep and powerful interest, and a feeling never to be obliterated from the heart.

On MONDAY Evening, July 21,1828,
I suppose I mast Rhyme—but how to begin it?
H e r e goes '—at the rate of 'bout ten lines a minute,
Then on Monday Evt next will yon go to the Play t
(July having turned juit Three Weehi to a day J
Should the Evening prove fine, and let's hope it won't rain,'.
I ' d presume to invite, and beguile you of pain.
If you miss it, you'll never the like see again.
As Sam Sav'ry I'll cook such a dish for your palate
As you don't often see, or scarce kno^r how to call it.
" Pheaiant Poult t Marinated, a la braiie Imperiale,"
Besides many tfiehnache, and other material,
By derire I shall chaunt out a stave 'mongst the Gods,
Perhaps get encored—that I don't who'll lay odds?
There'll be Songs by an ANGEL, as matter of course,
And between you and me, I've heard many sing worse.
Next a VANCE by those two lovely Nymphs, VAU8E and GARTH,
tV'e can scarcely see anything like it on earth.

LITTLE

FICKLE

—comes next, by our Daughter, I wish her
As well through the Scenes as the fara'd Clara Fisher,
But you can't expect that, for she ne'er play'd before,
>*or is she much versed in theatrical lore.
H e r Brother plays JOHN, and from this you will gather
T h e Boy can speak Yorkshire as well as his father.
Tbe ANGEL plays Tag, and he'll act it with rigour.
And can, if be likes, cut a capital figure.
Next a Ditty I'll try at—to make you ail laugh,
How they once chose a Mayor by an Ass or a Calf.
Then I sing you, in character,

WERRT

PEKOOLIAR

J!

And also reply, as tbe lovely

MITH JULIER.
After which tbe

CIVILIAN.
'tis called Civil Lion,
B u t the Farce is as good as you e'er clap'd your eye on.
Next a

PHANTASMAGORIA
we'll bring to the view,
And a better you cannot well look on, 'tis true ;
Comprising a many most curious sights.
St. Pauls, and a Sea view, with EddystoDO Lights,
A beautiful view of an Island (not Jersey)
But Malta—a Moonlight scene too, on the Mersey—
A Doctor, bis Patient, with fani'd

TOM A K B J L R M ¥ .
And many more subjects to make you all merry

John Bulls and Tim Bobbins
1 hope you'll attend,
Brother Masons and ODDS don't forget an old friend.
You the Gents PHJLHABM.NIC pray each take a place,
And each bring a Lady the Boxes to grace.
B u t I do not dictate to my friends where to sit.
You're equally welcome good folks to the Pit.
—My muse is worn threadbare. I say in my railery,
B u t it rhymes just to welcome the Cods tbe Gallery.

Can you come at FULL Price? I wish you all may,
But better at HALF Price than all stay away.

The plot of this interesting piece is founded on Sir Walter BcotVi Novel of " Tho Abbot" and embraces
several of the most affecting incidents in the history of Mary, the beautiful child of royalty ;inil misfortune.—
T h e Drama opens at tlie period of M a r y ' s imprisonment in L O C H L E V E N C A S T L E , under
t h e charge of Lady Douglas, whoso son, George Douglas, a romantic youth, in secret cherishes a
warmer sentiment than t h a t of loyalty for the fair Royal Captive, whose release, after several unsuccessful efforts, h e at last achieves. M a r y escapes from her insulated prison, but the young, the
chivalrous, the romantic George Douglas, falls a martyr to

ftotot aud Royalty,

The action of the Piece commences with the return of Toscar from a Hunting party, bringing with him
Fingal King of Scotland, and Oscar his son, who is betrothed to Malvina, daughter of Toscar. The fame of
Malvina's beauty coming to the ears of Cathulin, lord of Ulster, a fierce and lawless chief, he resolves by force
or stratagem, to obtain her lor himself; with this intent

He embarks for Scotland with a daring band.
And, to ensure success, he engages Conlath, another powerful Irish chief, to assist his enterprise ; who the
more readily enters into the plans of Cathulin, from a desire of

V E N G E A N C E ON T H E H O U S E O F T O S C A R .
Whose only ion, a few years previous, in a descent made by the Scotch, to quell an Insurrection in Ireland,
after having been hospitably entertained by Conlatb, abused the trust of a too-confiding friend, and bore away
his wife—but the villain perishes at sea, and Morna, the wife of Conlatb, is

Thrown on Shore close to the Walls of Toscar's Castle,
Where she is found and preserved by Malvina. Cathulin arrives, and after many fruitless attempts, at kmgth
succeeds in carrying off Malvina. He conveys her to a cave; but his band is soon assailad by her father's
followers, who, headed by Oscar, attempt ber rescue. Catbulin is called to lead on his troop, and leaves
Malvina in charge of Conlath, who, hearing his friends close pressed, is on the point of killing her, but is diverted from bis design by ber solicitations, and rosolres to save her. With this intent they descend further
into the cave, but to avoid pursuit, he wounds bis arm,

And leaves it behind him. After a variety of interesting adventures, the piece concludes with the re-union
of Conlath and Morna, and the restoration of Malvina to her father and lover.

T b e Plot of this interesting Piece is founded on Sir Walter Scott's Novel of "The Abbot "
and embraces several of the most affecting incidents in the history of Mary, the beautiful child
of royalty and misfortune. Tbe Drama opens at the period of Mary's imprisonment in Lochleven Castle, under the charge of Lady Douglas, whose son, a romantic youth, in secret cherishes
a wanner sentiment than that of loyalty for tbe fair Royal Captive, whose release, after several
unsuccessful efforts, he at length achieves. Mary escapes from her insulated prison, but the
young, the chivalrous, the romantic George Douglas, falls a martyr to Love and Loyalty, while
defending beauty, virtue, and misfortune, from insult, tyranny, and oppression.

Programme of the Scenery, etc.
Art l.—A HOMANTIC WOODLAND VIEW, LAKE, & MOUNTAINS in the Perspective. The Emissaries
of the Baron Hci nhauseu appear, and form plans to make Count Conenberg their Prisoner. A GOTHIC HALL
in the Castle of the Court. The GARDEN of the Castle, with GROTTO and SUB1 EBRANEAN PASSAGE,
into which the Count is ensnared by Wolfender, while Kaunitz and his comrades throw a large cloak over the
Count's head, and bear him off a prisoner.
Act 2.—Scene, T H E INTERIOR O F A COTTAGE—Night—approaching Storm, which gradually increases.
Amelia, daughter of the deceased Count, and who is supposed to have been dead some years, is here discovered
lamenting her forlorn state, an outcast from her splendid Birthright, but grateful to Heaven for the shelter, even
of this miserable roof. Whilst she is disclosing the sad vicissitudes of her life to her foster-sister Maria, she is interrupted in her melancholy recital by the marauders of Hcrnhausen, with their prisoner Count Conenberg, who
demand shelter from the storm. Amelia reluctantly consents to their taking possession thus rudely of her cottage.
When howe\er she discovers that their prisoner is her near kinsman, from whom she has been for years separated
owing to her long captivity; the interest of the scene becomes considerably increased from her repeated efforts to
rescue him from their power. Amelia at length accomplishes her arduous task by administering a powerful opiate
to Kaunitz and his companions ; and the Count, Amelia, and Maria are seen to cro-js the Lake just at the moment
that the violence of the THUNDER-STORM has aroused from their stupor Wolfender, Kaunitz and Kchampt.—
By the r< peated flashes of lightning they are enabled to perceive the boat containing their prisoner.—The thunder
and lightning here become appalling, the characters appear in the greatest consternation, and tbe curtain tails to
loud and descriptive Music.
A Night Scene. Kaunitz and his companions in search of the fugitives,
A c t 3,—WOODMAN'S COTTAGE.
and seeing the Woodman's Hut, demand admittance. Bruhl the Woodcutter, whom the violence of the htorm has
completely aroused, here enters, and not liking the looks of such gentry, answers them in a very blunt and concise
manner; but when he learns, from his nephew Moritz, that Count Conenberg had been borne off a prisoner, he
places himself at the head of his trusty Woodcutters, and hastens to his rescue. At length the Count and his companions lind shelter in the Woodman's Hut. Wolfender, well knowing that the Count cannot escape but by the
Bridge on which he has placed a strong guard, gives orders to his men to set fire to the Wood.
