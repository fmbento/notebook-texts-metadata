JLane ana Covent

Garden,

The only Successor of EMERY, F O R A F E W N I G H T S .
The most Talented Actor in his line of Character now living.
The following notice in the T I M E S , of Mr Rayners first appearance at Covent Garden will bear out this strong assertion
C O V E N T G A R D E N . — T h i s house has received a great acquisition to its present company in the person of
Mr. RATNKR, the gentleman who first made his appearance before a London audience at the English Opera House, in tlie
•ourse of the last season. It is highly creditable to the judgment of those who superintend the drama at Covent Garden,
that they seem to have felt, to the full extent, the importance of the choice they had made. Iu conformity with this feeling, they resolved to make a bold stroke in the very first instance, and selected the " School of Reform", to give Mr. R.
an opportunity of signalising himself at once in the arduous part of Tyke. Those who remember the late Mr. Emery in
the same part, will feel at once that there was much boldness in the experiment, nor would it seem probable to any one
venturing a conjecture that so great a vacuum as the death of Mr. Emery has occasioned in the dramatic world could have
been so soon and so well supplied as it is by Mr. Rayner. Covent Garden has made a hit through his means. The scene
in which he aids the escape of Frederick waj performed with great ability, and that in which he meets his father, abounded
with strokes of genuine feeling and passion. Nothing was done by the mere force of rant, for he does not reqiure to lash
either himself or his audience into a state of artificial excitement by any violence of voice or gesticulation. At the end of
the play, Mr. Abbott came forward to announce it for repetition ; but the call for Mr. Rayner was so enthusiastic, that
that gentleman came forward and apprised them of the night himself. There are many persons who object strongly to
this mode of complimenting a performer, but we confess that, though there is perhaps no precedent for it in theatrical
history beyond our own time, we can discover no good reason why the practice should not now commence. It is intended
a* a mark of high favour, and is accepted as such, and we presume that nothing more is necessary to establish its justification."—TIMES.

OPINIONS OF T H E P R E S S

(From the Yorkshire Gazette, April 13.) —u The Theatre.—On Monday last, we were present to witness the new pantomime "Tfc.
Oce.n Qneen," a great novelty to a York audience, but we were sorry to find that Mr Eisegood, under whose auspices this clever exhibit*.*
bus been got up, and who was to have personated the Clown, had sprained his ancle during the rehearsal, and was thus prevented from ei'vinu
that increased effect to the piece which his presence would have afforded. Mr Gourlay. however, undertook the part at a short notice au«
acquitted himself extremely well. He greatly delighted the " Upper House" and all the juveniles of the audience, especially by his i.ar'ennU
attentions to the little pig, the nursing and feeding of which called forth roar, of laughter from all parts of the honse. There lire two scene..
which are extremely beautiful and well artistically painted—the Ruby Castle and the Silver Lake. The part of Columbine by Miss Melvili.
™ very gracefully represented, and Mr. French, as Harlequin, was excellent. The acting of MissVillars, as Mirza, was very chaste • in fact
in this piece, the whole ot the corps pantomiraique acquitted themselves with great oredit before a numerous audience. On Tuesday evening
Mr. Wilkinson, the late Manager, took his annual benefit, when we were glad to see a very excellent house. Mr. Pritchard still persevenr
to render the drama attractive. Next Wednesday evening, the new pantomime is to be repeated, by desire, and we have no doubt every mis
gible arrangement will be made by the worthy lessee to suit the convenience and to meet the views and withes of those who may be disposed
W give our young friends a treat. One excellent provision has already been made, namely, that the performances will terminate a t o i i

From the Yorkshireman, April 13th.—Theatre-Royal.--The respected lessee of this theatre, continues to cater to the amusement of the patrons of the drama in this city. Various novelties are announced as in preparation, and some very distinguished professor, <>f the histrioni.
art have beau engaged, and will make their appearance forthwith on the boards of the theatre. Among other novelties is a new tragedy, the
production of a gentleman in this city, which is announced for speedy representation. On Monday we witnessed the performance of J a n .
Shore—a tragedy of infinite poetical power, but by no means popular. The part of Hasting was sustained by Mr. Pritchard in a very able
manner. Mr. Norton, as the Duke of Glo'ster, threw considerable energy into his arduous part, and sustained himself throughout in a very
•reditable manner. Mr. Holmes as Shore, exhibited in some readings, very good taste, and excellent appreciation of character. The remainder of the male characters were performed in a very unexceptionable manner. Miss Wsiverley Scott, as Jane Shore, added another
proof to those already existing, of the great versatility of her talents. As an elocutionist she is admirable, while her deportment ou the stag.
;s strikingly correct and fascinating.

Mr.RA7NER's
BENEFIT,

AND L A S T

APPEARANCE.

It would be surpurtfuons for t h e Manager to refer to the talent of Mr. RA Y N E R , every one must be fully
aware that he is T H R L A S T O F T H E A C T O R S in his line of business ; and as a considerable portion
of of a S T A R ' S R E M U N E R A T I O N is looked for on his Benefit Night, the Manager, with the utmost deference, trusts that the Public will come forward, and by their attendance, prove t h a t a G E N T L E M A N O F
R E P U T E in his profession can be estimated in York as well as elsewhere.
Mr. R. has endeavoured, by a chaste, careful, and he trusts, judicious selection of approved Dramatic
Compositions, to steer clear of that heavy drag of bombastic sentimentality, the leading feature of the French
and German Schools, difficult at all times of embodiment, and when produced not worth the trouble ; h e will
therefore on this occasion confine himself solely to articles of British manufacture, by producing, for the First
time in this T h e a t r e , a N e w Domestic Drama of peculiar interest entitled

Mr Prltchard respectfully announces to his Fri.nds an;! Pv 'ns, that being anxious to produce a , much NoTelty a* possible,
he has entered into an engagement with Edward Stirling, Esq [author of the ' Bohemians,' ' Captain Charlotte,' Ac. [ f . r the prccluo.i'.n
of a n.w D r a m a , f peculiar and novel construction, founded upon DICKENS'S celebrated and popular Work, entitled

A Christmas Carol, or Past, Present, and Furture
And which will be performed with New Music, Scenery, Machinery, & other Decorations, for the first time, to-morrow.
ADELPHI T H U T I I . — T h e attempt to dramatise Dickens's " Christmas Carol" at this Theatre has been perfectly successful ; less,
perhaps, from any dramatic situations for which the incidents in t h . original work afford scope, than from the faithful adherence of
the playwright to the dialogue and and tableaux of the Carol. Excepting an occasional scrap of drollery, apparently introduced by
Bob Cratchit to win gallery fa your, we traced ,ery few deviations from the language of Boz, while the supernatural visitations of the
fhost of Jacob Marley and the Three Spirits, wer. rigidly copied from Leech's coloured illustrations. Indeed all the Scenery a n .

Late of the 11th. (Lord Cardigan's) Hussars, or Prince Albert's Own Regiment.
Mr. Elsegood will appear as Clown this Evening, beiag his first appearance since his late indisposition.
The following extracts are from two of the leading Journals, on Captain H A R V E Y T U C K E T T .
(From the Times, 30th January.)——" LYCEUM THEATRE.—This house, which has dropped its title of the English Opera House, and
retains its other name, the " Lyceum," presented last night a scene of excitement rarely equalled. Not only was every part crammed literally
to suffocation, but it was crammed with persons who seemed as if they had come to see something quite out of the ordinary way, and there
was that sort of restless spirit among them which might manifest itself in uprorious kindliness or uncompromising hostility. And the occasion
that drew these people together was certainly a remarkable one. The house had been licensed by the Lord Chamberlain for the performance
•f the Shaksperean drama, and last night was the first instance of the old monopoly bein^ broken up in the city of Westminster under the
aew act. Moreover Mr. Harvey Tuckett was announced to play Falstaff. in the first part of Henri/ IF. and though he was unknown to the
public in a theatrical capacity, his name has been familiar enough to all to render him an object of curiosity. Indeed it was he who, w .
suspect, was the chief cause of attracting the immense concourse of people we beheld last night; and his reception was by the heartiest wellwishers. Mr. Tuckett remained a decided favourite with his audience throughout the evening; he finished hi. part in triumph, and was
called for at the end, amid plaudits so stunning that more could not have been awarded to Garrick himself."
From the Morning Herald.
*• THEATRE ROTAL LYCEUM.—Last night this Theatre opened for the season, with Shakspere's first part
•f King Henry IV. in which Mr. Harvey Tuckett was announced to make his debut i . the part of Falstaff. The interest excited by this
announcement appeared to be great, for shortly after the opening of the doors the theatre was filled in every part. The play commenced,
and Mr. H. Tuckett made his first appearance as a public performer before an English audience in the character of a comedian. He
understands and feels the character he has undertaken to represent, thoroughly, and there were parts here and there in which he succeeded
.dmirably. His greatest hit was the speech after his pretended death, at the battle of Shrewsbury, in which he ridicules the idea of honour
and glory. This effort was deservedly applauded for its proper emphasis and action."

P.rh.p», from any dramatic situation, for which the incidents in the original work afford scope, than from the faithful adherence of

Bob Cratchit to win gallery favour, we traced very few deviations from the languaga of Boz, while the supernatural visitations of th.

KING HENRY IV.

This Play is pronounced by Or. Warburfon, and other celebraled write.s. lo be equal in excellence to the most admired of
Shakspere'a Dramas. II embraces one of the most chivalrie and inlerestine portions of English history. It is a happy combination
of Comic Humour and Tragic Palhos- exhibiting, perhaps more than an> ollie. of his numerous productions, the tritnscendant geniu«
o f the immortal Bard,' Henry the Fourth deelinins into the vale of years, broken wi'h fickness, and agitated with remorse, resolv.«
to expiate the murder of his sovereign by a Crusa le to the Holy Land
Prom this resolution he is, however, diverted by the
•udden revolt of some of his principal Nobility—particularly the powerful house of Northumberland, at the head of which is the
chivalrous and daring Henry Percy, the renowned Hotspur. From these events arise all the incidents of the Drama, while to th*
wad-cap Prince of Wales, afterwards the Hero of Agincourt. we are indebted for our introduction to those joyous companions of the
Boar's Head—those minions of the moon —Poins, Peto, (i.dshill, Bjrdolf, and the inimitable Falstaff.

OPINIONS OF I H B PRUSS

From the York.hire Qttette.—" THI TB.ATBK.—If we just refer to the advertitement, it it tlmoit u.eleuforui to dwell on the excellency
of th* performances at the Theatre, or upon the continuous effort, on the part of Mr. Pritchard (by constantly prejenting something new) to
please the admirers of the drama in this city. On Tuesday evening, the " Christmas Carol, ' dramatited Irom Mr. Dickens's list new work of
that name, was represented. This is a spectacle that mast be teen to be July appreciated, being so far above what the title convey. ; and, when
once seen, this powerful ghost Mory will haunt the memory with its moral truth., and bring home to the miser nad the .elrish m in a conviction that will touch him, in the most vu nerable part, and the instruction he receives will be so convincing that when Christinas returns this
•cene will pass before him. How powerful a'ld how faithfully true to nature is the pen of the author—how beautiful bis style—what a picture
of the passions incident to humanity does he present. The symbol lie here hath drawn is but too truly a reflection from the character of thousand,
who stalk abroad in open day, and with the most grasping avarice, enrich themselves by the labours of the faithful, honest, aud industrious members of the lower classes, and then withhold from them the little relaxation of Christmas and other festive seasons. The time was when the little
pleasures of feast and fair cheered the labour, of a dreary year; but, one by one, many of these have been lopped off, have fallen into decay, or
have become overgrown with the weeds of mistaken opinions. As th. stage is an active and powerful ally in the cause of justice and virtue, nnd
a hater of cruelty and oppression, and since immoral raillery and licentious wit have been swept away, we wish that ,uch representation, as the
Christmas Carol, which so powerfully hold* op a mirror to man, were more frequent. The performer, in thi, piece did their utmost to give
effect, and were successful.

Upon that thought, and not on food, I fed; upon that thought, atd no! ou sleep. 1 rested," till at last he closes his career by suicide.
Opposite to Bertram stands the Prior ol St. Anselme, iu calm and fervent devot.on, —- a man whose mild and reverend lonctou. might
change the black creed of misanthropy, and bid its better angel half return."

The whole to conclude with a new domestic Drama, founded on some incidents in real life, called

THE SEWN CLERKS
OR T H E

Three Thieves, and die Denouncer.
The following Extract from a French work exhibits the very extraordinary character and events which the Drama will
be found to embody :—
" In September, 1651, died in the good City of Marseilles, one CLAUDE DARNAUD. This man, from a strange
variety of circumstances, had greatly attracted the notice and excited the surprise, horror, and detestation of his FellowTownsmen; in the early portion of his life he had been an eminent Merchant, but from a state of affluence had suddenly
fallen, through the villany of those in whom he confided, to one of comparative poverty. In this situation, disgusted with
traffic and deeply alloyed with misanthropy, he adopted the more profitable occupation of Usurer, in which avocation he
•ontrived to amass a vast store of wealth The more extraordinary portion of his career remains to be told:—It was his
practice to employ one clerk, and the first young man who held that office (Rowland Aubigne) had been but a short period
in his service ere he was suddenly accused of Robbery; the evidence brought against him appeared so clear, that his
Judges found no difficulty in pronouncing him Guilty, and the Culprit, in spite of his strong asseverations of innocence,
was immediately executed. Horrible as it may appear, every one who subsequently filled the office was charged with a
similar crime; in each case strong circumstantial evidence was produced, and at length no less than " SEVEN CLERKS"
had perished on the Scaffold, the victims of this man's charges. Many scrupled not to say that the youths were innocent,
and the Denouncer was regarded with corresponding detestation."

OF AGE TO-MJMOW

I j y This Farce was produced for the first time at the Theatre-Royal, Covent Garden, on the 1st of February, 1800.
I h e title is derived from the age of Frederick, the hero of the piece, who, " j u s t leaving his minority, proposes to submit
to government'' in the matrimonial state. The object of his affections is Sophia, the niece of Lady' Brumback a ridiculous old woman of fortune, whose hand is solicited by Baron Piffleburg, an old fox-hunter; and the various stratagems
by which Frederick endeavours to gain admission to his mistress, furnish the materials of the plot. These consist in the
assumption of characters—first of a HAIR-DRESSER, and afterwards of a'WOUNDED SOLDIER, and an OLD HOUSEK E E P E R ; in support of which he is aided by Maria, an arch, lively Waiting M*id. They are attended by.many truly
ridiculous circumstances and situations ; the result of which is a complete triumph over the sagacity of the "old lady and
the union of Frederick and Sophia.

A FAVOURITE DUET, BY THE MISSES HARCOURT.
To be followed by a New Grand Ballet, written and produced by Mons. L E C L E R C Q , entitled

B a c c h u s & Ariadne.

THE ARGUMENT.
Theseus having conquered the Minotaur, and extricated himself from the Cretan Labyrinth, by the aid of Ariadne, becomes her husband. —
At length weary of her society, he determines to revisit his kingdom. Ariadne is resolved to accompany him ; he (apparenlly) cheerfuily
consents, and they embark ; a storm arising, he makes it an exct.se for their landing on the Island of Delos, where he ungratefully leaves
her. Bacchus encounters her: Cupid playfully revenges himself for *, supposed aftront by causing a reciprocity of Love to be the result of
the meeting of Bacchus and Ariadne. Hymen ultimately unites the lovers; a Grand Bacchanalia takes place, and Ariadne becomes a
Constellation by the power of Bacchus. The whole produced with New Scenery, Dresses, and llecorations.

prepared for the popular occasion, leaves no room to doubt of
its being given to au overflow. Hull Packet March 7.
THEATRE ROYAL.—The winter season closes this evening
with the manager's benefit. That he will have an overflowing
house is an. affair of such absolute certainty that we need
hardly hint of the duty in this respect incumbent upon the supporters of the drama in Hull. It is gratifying ,o be able to
state that this season has pruved most successful, as compared
with those of the preceding three or four years. I his, we trust,
will lead to increased exertion hereafter on the part of Mr.
Pritchard, should he, as the public hope he will, continue lessee
of the York circuit.— Hull Advertiser, March 7.

T H E 1-RAMATIC SEASON.—Mr. PIUTCHABD closes his winter

campaign at our Theatre Royal this evening, and we rejoice to
record, in the words of the worthy lessee, that it has been
" highly successful." This his numerous friends will be the
more gn»tified to learn, when, remembering how the commencement was beset by the non-fulfilment of engagements, and other
ills the managerial throne is heir to. The derangement of one
plan proved but the harbinger of another's arrangement, and
the tact and celerity with which fresh attraction was brough
each week upon the scene, were responded to by fashion and
feeling on the part of the public, until the season has proved
fairly the best of all since the establishment has been under the
successful direction of Mr. Pritchard. It now only remains to

First Night of a New Tragedy, never acted in any Theatre.
THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN'S LICENSE.
" It having been represented to me by the Examiner of all Theatrical Entertainment, that a Manuscript entitled " The Spy of Venice," being
a Tragedy in five acts, does not in its general tendency contain anything immoral or otherwise improper for the Stage, I, the Lord Chamberlain
of Her Majesty's Household, do, by virtue of my Office, and in pursuance of the Act of Parliament in that case provided, allow the Performance
of the said Manuscript Tragedy at your Theatres.

THE SPY OF VENICE.

[Tiiis Tragedy is strictly Historical in all its main features, and is intended to describe and represent the Manners
Habits, and Customs of the Venetians, during the tyranny and usurpation of the Council of Ten Mr. PRITCHARD
thinks it right to .state that he has effected an arrangement with the Author for the purchase of the Copyright of this New
Dramatic Piece ; aud as a considerable portion of the Receipts of the First Night will go towards the Author in liquidation of his claim, the Manager is desirous that the fact should thus be publicly known. The Citizens will naturally be
anxious to patronise the literary abilities of a resident Author, and for this reason IMr. PRITCHARD has here intimated
the terms of his agreement, in the purchase of the Copyright ot the Tragedy.

The Drama of " THE DUMB BOY OF MANCHESTER,"
U N D E R T H E D I R E C T I O N O F MR. R. P O W E R ,
Having been received witb unbounded applause on its first representation, will be repeated this Evening, prejeded by
Shakspear's humourous Comedy of

" THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDiOR.'
This present Evening, M O N D A Y , J u l y 2 1 s t , 184.5,
H e r Mnjestv's Servants will revive Shakspear'd Comedy of

Falstaff in Love!
OR, THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR.
In this comedy Laughter h a . a secure and everlasting retreat. The melancholy may sigh, the pnritanieal may inveigh, and the whole earth
may become darkened with dogmas and denucintion*. authorised and unauthorised—but the comedy of TA« Merry Wives of Windsor will
gain strength by age, and influence by repetition—aud why should it not ? Its tendency is as directly moral as any sermon that ever was
preached. There is also this advantage attending it, that those who go to witness its representation, would not be, generally speaking, quite
so willing to sit out a sermon.
In The Merry tVives of fVindsor all the elements of fun app.-ar to be happily combined. There is Bardo/ph, wiih his vermillion nose,
Tittering his knavish notions to Nym, Pistol, <fcc They listen to ench other with as grave faces, and reply with as dry and rattling voices, as
so many judges adjudicating a question of life or death. There is Falstaff'—in love ! at least he makes attempts to seduce the ' Merry Wives,'
out the genius of merriment which so potently pre.ides throughout the comedy, ordains those mishaps which will come out better in the
representation than can be described. There is Sir Hugh Evans, an elderly Welsh knight, and Caius, an elderly French physician, boll, in
lore with ^nne Page; both in a passion; both pour out their rage in a stream of broken English; both resolve on a duel. In short, nothiag
toss than the authority of Justice Shaltow, sworn of the peace of our lord the King, can possibly put things into an amicable train again.
It would be presumptuous to attempt to point out all the comic humour of this play. Let every one see it acted and judge for himself.

First Appearance in this Theatre of the Popular Vocalist M I S S L A N D , (niece of the celebrated Listen) of the Theatre Royal Covent Garden.
FIRST APPEARANCE

OP MR. L. THOMPSON.

First Night of the New and successful Comedy of O l d H e a d s & Y o i l l l f f
(From a London Paper.)
It is no easy matter to come up to everybody's notion of a Comedy,
seeing that the word « comedy" floats among some four or five definitions, and if one of them be hit, the maintained of the rest will
probably be dissatisfied ; for there are the ethical folks, who talk
about the necessity of a comedy working out some moral purpose.
Then there are the champions of dialogue, nothing but dialogue, who
worship Congreve, and sneer at everything in the shape of stage
effect, or practical fnn. Working up a row of shining epigrams to
please this class, yonr action most likely stands still, and people who
came to look as well as to listen, grow wonderously weary. Then
there is a piece of lively intrigue: of t h . Spanish breed; without the
poetry ; startling by its concealments, awkward collissions, disguis
ings, and cross-purposes. This, if managed with reasonable cleverness, will keep an audience on the qui vive, but then it is sure to
incur the wrath of the moralist and the epigrammatist, and the words
" five act farce" are branded on it with ferocity. Fourthly, we have
that mixture of extravagant drollery and ultra-sentiment which was
so prevalent at the beginning of this century; and which makes up
the notion of a comedy with the old-fashioned play-goeis, while it is
execrated by the entire body of the literary world. To all these
several classes of drama has the word '• comedy" been applied ; and
scute indeed must he be who shall write a work to come under them
all. Of late years, however, th« fault of our so-called ''comedies"
has not been that th.y have pleased on-.' class of persons alone. On
the contrary, they have pleased nobody, and ranged every taction on
the opposition. We have have had dull productions, good of no kind,
that have expired without a friend. They have not been amusing,
snd have therefore failed ; for, be it remembered, if a work be amusing in some sort or other, it will work its way through the public
though three of the four factions above enumerated set their brains
and their pens to work to demolish it; and this do we say of Mr.
Dion Bourcicault's come ly of - OLD HEADS AND YOUNG HEARTS."

Hearts.

produced at the Haymarket Theatre, that it is the matt amusing Jivtact production thai hat been teen Jbr years, and that it hat pleated,
honestly pleased, the public to a degree that mag defy the exertion of
any opposing theoritt to dispute its claim to popularity.
Let us now come to the characters of the new play. Ther* ft a
yonDg barrister, Mr. Littleton Coke, without practice, and without
pence, who say, a variety ol good things. There is his friend, Lord
Charles Roebuck, who is a amoureux of the second order, and is in
love wit! Miss Rocket. As his father, Lord Pompion, design, lam
to marry his consin, Lady Alice, he employs Littleton Coke to make
love lo that lady, and leave him free for his inamorata. Lady Alice
is a dashing fine lady, a patroness of Almack's, and a rage among
the loungers of the opera. Miss Rocket is a lively girl, of a m o r .
unsophisticated order. Lord and Lady Pompion, the parents of Lord
Charles Roebuck, are two heartless people of quality, very neatly
sketched. The former, a cold politician, without a notion beyond
the furtherance of his party ; the latter, a listless fine lady, absorbed
in her lap-dog, and chiefly pleased with her sou's return from Paris,
because he brings with him some Eon de Cologne and the news of
the fashions. Colonel Rocket the father of Miss Rocket, is a blustering old military East Indian, whose whole language is from the army
vocabulary. The character is by no means uncommon to the stage,
but it is well-coloured, and the old man's doubt whether there ever
was a battle of Hastings, because it does not appear in the list, and
his inability to appreciate the Norman nobility who came over after
that event, because there is no great credit in coming after a battle,
are highly humorous. Tom Coke, the brother of Littletoc Coke, is
a plain Yorkshireman, who is at variance with Littleton for some
time, but afterward resigns to him certain pretensions to Lady Alice's
favour, together with the deeds of his estate, on which he has a mortage, forms a connecting link between this comedy and those of t h .
Morton school. The link is, however, bnt slight, as the class to
which the comedy belongs is of a far older date.

The Entertainments will commence with Beethoven's Overture to Prometheus,—by the Orchestra.
To be followed by, for the first time in this Theatre, Boureicaolt'a new and admired Comedy of

Old Heads and Young Hearts.
1 bequeath yon to the conduct of the Old Heads, and to them I would say
Did you ever see a little child leading an old blind man ?
How can age best repay such charity ? Why, by guiding the blindness of youth, which is love: this is the last debt due from an OLD
HEAD TO A YOUNG HEART.

The Scenery by Mr. C. Fisher; the Decorations and Properties by Mr. Gibbs; the Machinery by Mr. Bath; the Costumes by
Mr. Harry and Mrs. Gibbs.

expressly arranged by himself: and in consequence of this agreement, the Orchestra will, in the course of the Evening,

Third Appearance in this Theatre of

The celebrated Vocalist, Miss Land,
(niece of the celebrated Comedian, Listen) of the Theatre Royal Covent Garden.
Who elicited the most rapturous applause on her first appearance on Tuesday evening, by a distinguished audience, and

Which has been pronouueed by the united voice of the London press to be one of the best Farces produced for many years

" T h i s Evening, T H U R S D A Y , MARCH 1 2 t h , 1 8 4 6 ,
Her Majesty's Servants will perform the interesting Drama (translated from the German of Kotzebue, by Benjamin

Previous to which t h e O r c h e s t r a will p l a y t h e O v e r t u r e to " T a n c r e d i . "
•* We may fairly remark that •' The Stranger" has rivettad the attention, drawn the tears, »od excited the applause of the public dnrinmany years. Certainly a more amiable picture of repentance »ai never exhibited on the stage, and of the many who have witnessed thi, representation, we verily believe there is not one (critic, excepted) bot has hailed the denouement with the most pleasing emotions. The ch»jacter of the " Stranger" is finely imagined—he is a misanthorpe, not by nature, bat circumstances ; he had trusted and had been fatal],
deceived, and having suffered in the very neRr and d»ar relations of wife and friend, be became disgusted with mankind, and resolved never to
tnut more. The lighter parts of this play form a pleasing contrast to the sombre J the important Mr. Solomon, with his " Sunday wig" and
- Foreign Correspondence." and Master Peter, " who thanks bis stars he w.s not born a fool," yet lacks the wit to help « bis little excellency
out of the water, are extremely amusing.

they necessarily must be than those excited by the perusal of general
literary productions, widen the sphere of thought, and teach TO
losing pity tor our tellow-beings : improving ihus at once the m i n d
and the h e a r t . I t is a mistaken notion, therefore, to think t h a t th»
love of h o m e should nainraliy lead its possessors to the neglect . 1
the acled d r a m a . This m a y , indeed, serve as a restriction. whe»
nothinf truly valuable or moral is to be seen ; bnt it ceases t o a«t
when any real dramatic m a g n e t of attraction exercises it sympathetic influence. We are therefore fairly justified in arriving at the
conclusion, that we must look to some other cause for the non-snecess of the d r a m a , and in asserting that domes'ic exclusiveness is a
m e i e passing accident, liable to great modifications, at the least,
from the influences of true d r a m a t i c genius, when once fairly
brought into play. T h e n let the m a r a g e r persevere in the legitim a l e d r a m a , and
success is certain.—Hull Packet,

Hi. sceptre shows the force of temporal power.
The attribute to awe and majesty.
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of king,;
But mercy is above the sceptr.'d s w a y It i, enthroned in the hearts of kings,

It is an attribute of God himself;
And earthly power doth then shew likest God'.
When mercy season's justice: therefore, Jew,
Though justice be t Q h plea, consider thi»—
That, in the course f justice, none of us
Should see salvation ; we do pray for merer:
And that same prayer doth teach us all lo render

*F* T H E PUBLIC 13 MOST RESPECTFULLY INFORMED
That, iu compliance with the earnest request ol nia'iy Patrons aud Frequenters of the Theatre, the practice adopted in:!
most of the London Theatres, and alhthe Principal Continental ones, uamoly, that of

Turning down the Gas Lights of the Audience Department
During the actual time of performance, and restoring the light during the intervals between the acts, will be adopted,
experimentally for a few night.. The advantages proposed to be attained will arise from increased brilliancy given to
the Stage during the performance., and the reduced heat, and glare upon the-eyes uf the Auditors.

First Night of the Revival of Reynolds's excellent Comedy of T i l E

THE HAIL, §W A r

W I L L .

KING

Will make his Second Appearance on the York Stage.

On Wednesday Evening, March <-5tli.
Her Majesty's Servants will perform, for the first time under the present Management, Revnoids' admiied Coined? of

THE WILL!

In this comedy we miss one of the ilist n^ui*hiog m a r k s thnt belong
to the d r a m a of Mr. Reynolds—a modern r a k j and ratUe, a VapiJ,
a T o m Tick, a Gingham, a G o s s a m e ' . But we have something
quite as good, and perhaps better,—» plensmg story, i n e y dia ogae,
and characters that are humorous without buffoonery. T h e plot
turns ou the circumstance of a y o u n s geutlerua i, Mr. Maujeville,
iu consequence ot a debt, '* benevolently contracted to serve a
friend," being compelled to fly to I n d i i ; leaving his infant
daughter under the care ot a govern,':--', one Airs. Rigid, who having
conceived a pas-ion for the father of her ward, previous to his
marriage with her own cousin, whom, it seems, he had u m c c o u n ably preferred, resolves to take ample vengeauce for the slight, by
suppressing his letters, and pocketing his remittances ; by which
means she induces M r , Mandeville. sen., to reward the supposed
barbarity of his son by disinheriting him, aud leaving his entire
fortune t o his gr.mdchild, Albina Maudeville. T h i s young lady
grows op in years and in beanty ; and, having arrived at that age
when, by the laws of nature aud the d r a m i, she is permitted to fail
i» love, fixes her affection, most opportunely, on Mr. Howard, the
Boo of the very man whose defalcation had been the cause of her
father's oriental trip. Iu the meantime, Mandeviile. surprised and
alarmed at receiving no answers .o his letters—th ir suppression
having never been dreamt of in his philosophy—returns to h.s native
country, with a scapegiace v a l e t ; who, like m a s t e r tike man, had
accompanied him to India for equally substantial aud weighty
reasons.
T e old a l a g e , " in vino Veritas," receives whimsical illustration
iu the person of Mr. Ver.tas, a gentleman who is a sad rogue in his

mbtf senses, but a r.ght hon-st fe low in his cups. T o D r . Alrich's
Jive reasons for drinking —
" Good wine, a friend, or being dry,
Or lest we should be by-and-by,
Or any other reason why"—
We may, with great propriety, add tiiith—since
to be houest is but
to be drunk, and to walk uprightly is onl> to be incapa'.le of standiug
upon one's legs. Mr. Veritas, in an unhuppy interval of sobriety,
had entered into a compact with Mrs. Rigid ;a lover of the Platonic;
to pay her down one-half of Albina's fortune, on his marriage with
that yoang lady, as a bribe for her matrimonial services. But, owing
to certain conmunctions visits of drink, aud led by intoxication from
the error of his way, he becom >s tipsy and repentant; his honesty
returns as his senses recede. The first bottle stagger* his wicked
purposes, the second awakens his good resolutions ; ere the third is
despatched, he becomes as virtuous as may be, and as drunk as a
lord : and truth, wuich some philosophers have looked for in a ice//,
is discovered in a bottle. Let us, therefore, remember that, whe«
oor head b 'gins to turn rouud ('tis a long head that has never »
turning), we are on the highroad to truth ; and our optics see douhl*
—we are at odds with virtue, double or i/uiu.
A variety of characters are introduced ; some w himsical situations
arise; and, a'ter the usual number of turnings and windings, of
quarrels and reconciliations, of difficulties thric* created, and (like
Alexander's foes) tnrice conquered, the treacherous governantt is
detected and disgraced, the young lady m a r r i e l , and every t h i n ,
goes off in a • mooth and quiet way.

T . E A T R r - R o v i L . — T h e T h e a t r e daring the past week has, with
tke exception of one or two nights, been very well attended. T h e
harry of the a r i z e s precluded ul from noticing the re opening of the
Theatre for a short sea<on, under Che m a n a g e m e n t of Mr. J . L.
eriichard.
We should certainly very much lesire lhai the season
J'i.l commenced may be a more profitable one to the manager than
*ny which have of lale years preceded it. We desire this lor m a n y
reasons—two of which an-, that it would alliance a more correct
t$ste for the legitimate drama, and, secondly, enable the m a n a g e r
to produce good five act pieces, sustained by good actors. W e do
•ot mean to convey that the present corpsdramatiaue of Mr. Pri chard
tt *u i n e r i o r o n e . Rather, indeed, the reverse; and we believe
very much superior to m a n y country companies. Let the citizens
•f York only encourage the manager, and of a surety he will see it
to be his interest to add to the efficiency and t a l e n t of even h i ,
J'eseut company. We a r e glad to see that our old favourites,
—essrs. Holmes, Bruce Norton, and Reynolds, still f o r m a portion
°f the staff. In addition to them we have Mr. Gomersal,—one of
tie drye.t v £austic, low comedians we have witnessed perform for
tome period. Mr. Pritchard h a s introduced to a York audience, a
»esdebutant in the person of Mrs. H. Williams. She is a lady of
very striking appearance, tall and somewhat queenly in her tout
—newAfc. H e r voice is good, musical, a n d correct in its intonation,
• a i throughout the whole of her sustaiument of character there is a
(leasing aud unflagging vivacity which r e n d e r , her a favourite w.th
™e ndience till the curtain drops. We witnessed her ou Monday
•Hght in one of the most artistical and difficult character* in the
w
*ole range of the legitimate d r a m a . We mean Lady T e a r ! , in

PavT
*'

March 2 8 . )

Sheridan's excellent comedy " T h e School for S c a n d a l . " I t e r ,
and there we thought her entrances an I exits somewhat too rapid •
and we only mention this trifling circumstance that she may impro?e
npon i t . Of her conception of Lady Teazle we would speak in the
highest terms of romm -illation. H e r pathos in the ]»»t scene was
as effective as her previous vivacity
We believe .Mr.. Williams
possesses more than ordinary qnalifications to constitute her b»
siu'iy, an actress of higher pretensions than we usoall, fiud in a
country company. Of Sir. P r i t c h a r d ' s Charles Sur-sce we need
not speak. It was a d m i r a l t y sasiained: b a t . nevertheless, we have
seen him perform it better. It was somewhat uneven. Nothing 1
could be finer than his performance hroughout the last three act*.
W e thought him too flat a t the commencement. On the whole,
however, we have seldom seen M r . P r i t . h a i d to greater advantage!
T h e same recommendatory remarks apply with eqaa! justice to M r .
Holmes's representation of t h a t eternal canting hypocrite J .seph
Surface. It was a very excellent piece of acting, and would h a , ,
done no discredit to a greater n a m e than h i s . Mr. Norton'sO'iver
Surface was all that eoold be desired, well conceived, and equally
sustained. M r . tiomersall's Sir Benjamin Backbite was very creditable to that gentleman ; as was likewise the Sir P - t e r Teazle of
M r . Reynolds. If there a r e others of the company whom we hav*
omiited to notice deservedly, it is because we a r e warned that w .
havealready scribbled upon sundry slips of p a p e i , and that our
space h a s become exhausted. We hope Mr. Pritchard will ennrinat
to confine himself to the legitimate d r t m a ; and if he sbonl I fail of
success, we shall, nevertheless, duly r a t e those exertions whereby k»
amply deserves it.

" That lumbering, slow, honest John ; that John so heavy, but so light of spirit; so rongh npon the surface, but so gentle at the core ;
so dull without, so quick within ; so stolid, but so good."
Tackleton, t h e Toy Maker
M r A . E . Reynolds
" H e didn't look mueh like a Bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face, and a screw in hi. body, and
his hat jerked oyer the bridge of his nose, and his hands stuck down into the bottom of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill conditioned wlf
peeri.g oat of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number of ravens."
Caleb Plummer, his Man
M r Norton
- A little, meagre, thoughtful, dirty-faced man, who seemed to haTe made himself a great coat from the sack-cloth covering of some old
bor ; for when he turned to shut the door, he disclosed upon the back of that garment the inscription C and T, in large black capitals."
T h e Stranger
M r Everett
» His garb was very quaint nd odd—a long, long way behind the time. He had long white hair ; good features, singularly bold, and
well defined for an old man ; and dark, bright penetrating eyes."
M r s Peerybingle, familiarly known a s *' D o t "
Miss Edwards
" Fair she was, and young—though something of what is called tfie dumpling shape; but I don't myself object to that."
Bertha, Caleb Plummet's Blind Child,

•» Tackleton w a g . man of taste beyond all question . May was very pretty."
Mrs Fielding, her Mother
M r s Edwards
" An old lady with a peevish face, who was very genteel and patronizing. The majestic old soul bad adorned herself with a cap, calculated to inspire the thoughtless with sentiments of awe."
Miss Slowboy, a Foundling
M r Gomersal.
" T h e maternal and pa'ersal Slowboy were alike unknown to fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity a Foundling, which
word though differing only from Fondling by one vowel's length, is very different in meaning, and expresses quite another thing."

- The Kettle and the Cricket, at one and the same moment, and by some power, of amalgamation best known to themselves, sent each

T h e I n t r o d u c t i o n o f t h e St r a n k e r .
"If you please I was to be left 'till called for,' said the Stranger mildly. ' Don't mind me.' With that he teok a pair of spectacles from

of the Carrier

The good Carrier was puzzled and made uncomfortable and uncertain in spite of himself.

He couldn't help shewing it in his manner "

THE ALARM!
• She only answered by beating her hands together and falling into a wild fit of laughter. Then sinking from his grasp upon the groand
she covered her face with her apron, and wept bitterlr."

The Stranger Received Into the Carrier's House.
CHIRP T H E SECOND.—The Abode of CALEB PLUMMER, the Toy Maker.
* A little cracked nutshell of a house, but no better than a pimple on the prominent red-brick nose of Gruff and Tackleton. The premise, of Gruff and Tackleton were the great feature, of the street; but yon might have knocked down Caleb's dwelling with a hammer or two
and carried off the pieces in a carte*
T H E B I I N H G I R L ATVO H E R F A T H E R .
" In the midst of all these objects Caleb and his daughter sat at work. The blind girl bnsy as a doll's dress-maker; and Caleb painting
aad glazing the four pair front of a desirable family mansion."

MRS- PEERYBINGLE'S PIC-NIC
'• I declare I wouldn't go to Bertha', without the Veal and Ham Pie, and thing,, and Bottles of Beer for any money. Regularly once a
fortnight, ever since we have been married, John, have we made our little Pic Nic here. If anything was to go wrong with it, we ahould
almoet think we were never to be lncky again."

THE BLIND GIRL'S CONFESSION.
« Whilst speaking she had released May Fielding's hands, and clasped her garments in an attit.de of mingled supplication and love.
Slaking lower and lower down, as she proceeded in her strange confession, ,he dropped at last at the feet of her friend, and hid her blind facp
in the folds of her drees."
•• Great God,' exclaimed her father, smitten at one blow with the trath, ' have yon deceived her from her cradle, hut to break her heart
at last"

Tne Stranger Join* the Party.
" A chair in th» earner, and leave to sit quite silent and look pleasantly about him is all he cares for."

THE FEARFUL

DISCOVERY.

"The carrier clenched his strong right hand at first, as if he would have beaten down a lion. But opening it immediately again, he
•pread out again before the eyes of Tackleton, for he was tender .f her,even then, and fell down, a , weak as any Infant."

when the wife (who has hitherto shown good qualities), unable to resist the current of fashionable ridicule, joins in t i e laugh at her husband's

{From the Yorkshire Gazette. Saturday, 4pril 18/A, 18*6.)
T B E S T R B R o T A b . — W e a r e g l a d that the hope we expressed,and the prediction which we made last week, h a r e been realized first, th
bope that the courteous a n d very accommodating attendant a t the Boxes, M r . Partrick, s h o u l d , " in truth and in fact" have a benefit »"

night, to Hie advantage of the son of the late manager, Mr. T a t e Wilkinson. T h e third proposition we made was, that on Wednesda,
evening a numerous sudienc^ should acknowledge the nnceaiing effoft. of Mr. Pritchard, the present lesse-, to render the T h e a t r e a nlae
of resort not only for amusenjent, but for instruction.
With regard to this proposition, we regret to say that we were not quit* . 0 s.ece.sfaL
•Hboagh there was a very fair honse. But the " Cricket on t h e H e a r t h , " as produced on o a r stage is worthy of a bumper. It is indeed a

c»« confidently confirm the assertion of the •spirited manager that he h a s not only spared n o pains, b n t availed himself of every s u g g e s t i .
calculated to m a k e this " Cricket on t h e H e a r t h " the best version of Bez's tale yet produced. T h e r a p t n r o - s applause with which Ft waa
received on Wednesday, indnced a repetition last evening, when the audience were equally delighted. I t ha* decidedly gained a footin. 01

T H E CABIN BOY, OR T H E W H I T E SLAVE.
This Evening, WEDNESDAY, April 22rd, 1846,

Her Majesty's Servants will personate, for the first time h a re, an entirely New Historical Drama, in Five A ts, written by
THOMAS SMIBKRT, Esq. late Editor of the Scotsman newspaper, contributor to Tait"s Magazine, Tab a o! the Border,
Ciiambors' lournal, &c. entitled

THE CUBE'S WIFE!
Produced under the Superintendence of Mr P R I T C H A R D .

The Author, in his Advertisement to the published Play, states—" For the incident which su gesied the following piec, an I which form, the
basis of its plot, the reader is referred to the well-known Memoirs of the Duke of Sully, and of Marshal Uassompiore. Historical "Cruracy »
dosely preserved as regards the attachment of Henry the Fourth to the daughter of the Duke of Montmorenci. his disruption of her marriage with
the courtly Marshal mentioned and his conference of herh.nd, with not very commendable view:, npon tlie you ig Prince of Condi5, who, however,
proved not at all the flexible kind of p rsonaae anticipated by the king. With the concluding portion of the Plav, a later incident in the life of
the same Prince of Conm*, father of the more illustrious bearer of the title, has been interwoven ; and the reader is requested to pardon tha*
liberty, the chief one taken with the veraci-us nnnals of those days. It alludes to the circumstance of the imprisonment of the Prince, when hi.
wife vindicated her character by insisting on sharing his cell in the Bastile. If it be imagined that H.nry ' the Great,' as his countrymen ar- wont
to call him, has been wrongfully represented in this piece, the author would but point to the narrative of Sully, w hei e may be found proofs, not
only that the main incident in the drama befoie the reader is historically true, but al-o that such events were but too common in the career o f .
Prince otherwise truly great and good. . . . I D composing the piece, the author had before his eyes the failures ot many recent candidates for dramatic success, and believing these fai ures to arise from forgetful ness of the supereminent importance of ACTION in plays, he perhaps, has run into
the opposite extreme, and may have paid too little attention to those graces of sentiment and expression which our elder writers for the stage infuseed sofreely, beautifully, and aptly into their productions.

when our amusements are thus rendered conducive to humanity.

T H E PROGRAMME A N D I N C I D E N T S A R E AS FOLLOW:

A Negro Rebellion having taken place in Surinam, the oppressed very naturally turn upon the oppressors, and give
them a taste ol arbitrary rule. The piece opens with the arrival of t h . Governor; aud i*. is edifying to mark how tha
rejoicings and congratulations of the tenilied Planters have their origin in the assured protection of his presence. Among
the Negroes is a favourite Slav, called Gambia, who acts as their mediator with *he Governor. For tfceir faults h . entreat.
his mercy—fir their helplessness his pity—for their wrongs his protection
He had not joined in their Rebellion, .in*«
liberty when linked with rapine and crueltv might prove a worse state than even S avery.

Mr. P R I T C H A R D begs to state that h e has chosen this D r a m a , on his "complimentary n i g h t " f.r sundry reasons. The O a k T n . v —

Mer be cherished in the grateiul recollection of Englishmen ! T h e escape of Charles, indeed, most be esteemed as one of the most remarkabU*»"nt.* in the history of t h i s c o u n l r y . T h a t escape, the historical reader need not be told, took place immediately after the defeat of th«
Royal Army a t Worcester in 1650. Charles, assisted by the Scots, c r o s s e j t h e . T w e - ' d , gained a signal victory a t Dunbar, reached
Worcester, but was there defeated, a n d his whole a r m y nearly cut to pieces. He look refuge in the thick foilage of the Oak, baffled h i .
pursuer, and escaped to France early in 1631. Such are the remarkable events upon which this D r a m a is founded ; and all men mnstconced*
the importance of the incidents, a n d the highly dramatic chacracter of th» subsequent results. The Oak branch a n d leaf is still venerated on

This present Evening, F R I D A Y , J u l y 81st, 1846,
Her Majesty's Servants will perform t h . celebrated Comedy of Tae

HYPOCRITE!

This Comedy, originally the Tariufe ui ifoliere, first translated and adapted to British habits by Cibber, subsequently assnmiog i t ,
present form and name «mder the skilful reiisal of Biekerttaff, has, in all its various applications, been found an useful antidote to the
cowardly and contemptible vice which is the object of its satire. But although ranking high in public estimation, in the several ages
the circumstances of which it has been moulded and remoulded to meet, at no period has it been more popular than the present; for
crowds have thronged to witness its oft-repeated representation ; and even Majesty has condescended to mark his opinion of the justice
of its censure, by commanding its performance. Perhaps such a play as the Hypocrite was never so necessary, nor such latire a, it
contains ever so provoked as at the present moment; for at no former period did sanclimoniousness make so formidable a stand against
true religion ; never before were such inroads made upon the comforts of civilized life, by crafty pretenders to holiness • nor ever
vrere the morals of the poor, and the pockets of the rich, in such peril from igrorant but cunning trafficers in religiout hypocrtiy. The
Stage does not presume to interfere with creeds and consciences—it d,es not set itself up as a theological Aristarch ; but vice ic
every form, is a fair mark for the Oramatic satirist, and the Drama does a real service to society, when It holds up to scorn and contempt the jobber in righteousness, the pious pilferer—in one word—THE H Y P O C R I T E .

D A Y

Wednesday Evening, August 19,1846,
Her Majesty's Servants will perform (for the first time in York) Sullivan's new Comedy of A

BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK

All the Characters in this juitIy-popular Comedy are well conceived, strongly drawn, and most aptly realise the Author's description.
The two following may be adduced as a proof :
For the character of Moreeraft, captain, yon really put me to my wit's end. I aint able to do jasti.e to him. I've found him a
double-faced varlet that no generosity can keep honest—who would rather lose by a lie than gain by the truth—and who never had a
thought in his life but how he might bite the hand that fed him. I cannot give him any other passport into your service, unless it's a
recommendation that he has just been kick'd out of mine—that's his character.
Master Cymon 's as big a hyoocrite as ever was crammed into on. skin. There's no oath which be'd not break -no innocence which
he'd nut betray, and no wickedness in the world to which his conscience could not be reconciled. From his youth up, he appears to
have been a mean cowardly hypocrite—low and profligate habits soon sent him to consort with kindred souls, and his education completed, h. re-appears—a prodigy—t. g ive the world the benefit of it. He had an aged relation, of large means, but between him and
these hopes was a young and beautiful girl for whom It was reported all this wealth vat destined—He sought and won th. affection of
this poor girl. The old relation died, and contrary to all expectation, he, this profligate, received what he had coveted—but the girl
was peanyless—yet how could she doubt the vows which had been treasured in her pure heart for years ! Oh, you are a man of feeling
~ I see you are—the apprehension of her fate has taken the bl.od from her lips before you have heard it—the storm has struck—the
lightning has gone through every cranny .f him from head to foot.
Sir John Coverdale, Mr A. B . Reynolds—Horace Waldegrave, Mr Holmes—Cymon Foxall, Mr Gomersal
Ernest Coverdale, Mr B U R C H E L L (from the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, his first appearance on the York Stage)

THIRD APPEARANCE ON THE YORK STAGE OF

MISS AOOSTA & MISS FITZPATRIGK,
Whose performance on Thursday and Saturday Evenings elicited the most rapturous applause, and
were honoured by a unanimous call from a highly respectable audience to appear before the Curtain.
The following it extracted from the Yorkshire Gazette uf Satttrdmg the bth instant.
THE THEATRE.—The performances daring the week have be«n of an attractive character, and we are happy to say that the enterprise of
tbe worthy Lessee has been well appreciated. This was particularly the case on Saturday evening, when he had a very fashionable house, under
the patronage of the Earl de Grey and the Officers of the Yorkshire Hussars. On Thursday evening last we had a most delightful treat, in witnessing the introduction of two young ladies, pupils of the celebrated Mrs. Glover, in Sheridan's comedy of "> The Rivals." One of them who
not being named, we must call the " Young Lady," made her third appearance upon any stage, and sustained the character of Lydia Languish •
tbe other, Miss Acosta, who has recently made a very successful debut at the Haymarket, took the part of Julia Melville.
It u r since wv
have seen the York Stage look so well, and it is still longer since we have seen an audience so captivated and delighted. TherI ..umethme
peculiarly prepossessing in the personal appearance of both these young ladles. We may have seen prettier women, and better peifuVmers * but
there is here a mingling of these attractions in each case which no one can resist, and which promises well that, as they become more experienced,
they will deserve, position in the first rank of the actresses of tbe*present day. The ' Young Lady' was very correct in her perceptions, and
although she might very naturally appear somewhat tame in the first-scene, stilt, towards the denouement of the piece, all must have seen and
evidently from their applause, did feel, that the developemeWof the part she had undertaken was just, graceful, and discriminating. She seems
to be fully aware that to near perfection we must approximate "nature, for she cast away many of those silly stage conventionalisms (of which we
have sadly t oo much now-twIays), and thus her greatest charm consists in the pure, artless nature of her acting. The performance of Miss
Acosta was a triumph of pure genius throughout. If we were to select any particular passage as the gem of her personation of thetcharacter of
Julia Melville, it would be that in which she declares her love for Faalkland, but at the same time expresses her honest indignation «t the deceit
which he attempts to practice upon her, in order to regain her affection and confidence. This scene was exquisitely faithful. The genuine heart
storm was on, and the eye —the tone—the general bearing—nay, the everything, attested the truthfulness of the personation. The young ladies
were well supported by Mr. Pritchard as Captain Absolute, and by Mr. Bruce Norton in the character of Faulkland. Sir Anthony Absolute (Mi.
Reynolds) was quite at home, and Mr Gomersal's Bob Acres was extremely good, particularly in the latter part of the piec. Mr. Everett made
at good a Sir Lucius OTrigger as his age and figure would allow, and Mrs. Blauchard's Mrs. Malaprop did her considerable credit. At the conclusion of the play the young ladies were called for, and on being conducted in front of the curtain by Mr. Pritchard they were hailed with a
mos t enthusiastic burst of applause.

F O U R T H A P P E A R A N C E ON T H E Y O R K S T A G E

OF

MISS ACOSTA & MISS FITZPATRICK,
Whose performance on the three previous Evenings elicited the most rapturous applause, and were
honoured by a unanimous call from a highly respectable audience to appear before the Curtain.
The following is extracted from the Yorkshire Gazette of'Saturday the 5th instant.
THE THEATRE.—Tbe performances during the week have been of an attractive character, and we are happy to say that the enterprise of
the worthy Lessee has been well appreciated. This was particularly the case on Saturday evening, when he had a very fashionable house, under
the patronage of the Earl de Grey and the Officers of the Yorkshire Hussars. On Thursday evening last we had a most delightful treat, in witnessing the introduction of two young ladies, pupils of the celebrated Mrs, Glover, in Sheridan's comedy of •*• The Rivals." One of them, who,
not being named, we n,ust call the " Young Lady," made her third appearance upon any stage, and sustained the character of Lydia Languish;
the other, Miss Acosta, who has recently made a very successful deiut at the Haymarket, took the part of Julia Melville. It is long since w'«
have seen the York Stage look so well, and it is still longer since we have seen an audience so captivated and delighted. There is something
peculiarly prepossessing in the personal appearance of both these young ladies. We may have seen prettier women, and better performers; but
there is here a mingling of these attractions in each case which no one can resist, and which promises well that, as they become more experienced,
they will deserve a position in the first rank of the actresses of the present day. The ' Young Lady' was very correct in her perce ptions, and
although she might very naturally appear somewhat tame in the first scene, still, towards the denouement of the piece, all must have seen, and
evidently from their applause, did feel, that the developement of the part she had undertaken was just, graceful, and discriminating, she seems
to be fully aware that to near perfection we must approximate nature, for she cast away many of those silly stage conventionalisms (of which we
have sadly too much now-a-days), and thus her greatest charm consists in the pure, artless nature of her acting. The performance of Miss
Acosta was a triumph of pure genius throughout. If we were to select any particular passage as the gem of her personation of the character of
Julia Melville, it would be that in which she declares her love for Faulkland, but at the same time expresses her honest indignation at the deceit
which be attempts to practice upon her, in order to regain her affection and confidence- This scene was exquisitely faithful. The genuine heartstorm was on, and the eye—the tone—the general bearing—nay, the everything, attested the truthfulness of the personation. The young ladies
were well supported by Mr. Pritchardas Captain Absolute, and by Mr. Bruce Norton in the character of Faulkland. Sir Anthony Absolute (Mr.
Reynolds) was quite at home, and Mr Gomersal's Bob Acres was extremely good, particularly in the latter part of the piece. Mr. Everett made
as good a Sir Lucius O'Trigger as his age and figure would allow, and Mrs. Blanchard's Mrs. Malaprop did her considerable credit. At the conclusion of the play the young ladies were called for, and on being conducted in front of the curtain by Mr. Pritchard they were hailed with a
most enthusiastic burst of applause.

THE HUNCHBACK I

ThisComedv was performed in London to crowded houses, for upward, ot 300 nights. One of the first critics of t h .
day, in reviewing it, observes, ' That without undue panegyrics, it would not be easv to overrate Mr. Knowles's merit.;
he can afford to let his faults be counted up uy envy, or his excellence exaggerated bv friendship. In any case, his talent.
•re too sterling not to find their proper station in the literature of his count rv : and this Play will abide its fame through
(nuty generations, who will yet witness its performance with renewed delight."

Her Majesty's Servants will perform tin* iut riujj Piav (translated from the German of Kotzebue) of The

STRANGER:
Or, Misanthropy

#•

Repentance.

We may fairly remark that •• The Stranger" has -.vetted the attention, drawn the tears and excite 1 the applanse of
the pub.ic during mauy years Certainly a more amiable picture of repentance was never exliibited on the stage, and
of the many who have witnessed its representation, we verily believe there is not one (cities excepted/ but has hailed
the denouement with the most heart lei: emotions. The character of " the Stranger" is finely imagined—he is a misanthrope, not by nature, but circura-ranee ; he had trusted, and had been fatally deceived; and having snff -red in the
-ery uear and dear relations ot wi:e and friend, he l»ccaiue disgusted with mankind, and resolved never to trust more.—
The lighter parts of this p'ay form a pleasing contrast to the sombre; the important Mr S o o n >n, with his " Sunday
»ig,'' and " Foreign conespoiideiice," and Master Peter, who " thanks his star, he was not boru a fool,'' yet lacks the
wit to help '• his little excellency" out of the water, are extremely amusing.

M R . P R I T C H A R D regrets that the E n g a g . m e n t s of these charming Actresses at Liverpool, next week,
preclude the possibility of his securing their services beyond THURSDAY next, which is appointed for
T H E I R B E N E F I T , and positively the L A S T N I G H T of their appearance on the 22nd Instant.

Being an alteration by the late Mr. WOODS, of Edinburgh, from the Original Comedy.

SHAKSPBAK'S Comedy of Errors has never obtained a rank on the Stage equal with the other Comedies of that excelleat
Author : the frequent repetition of similar blunders, which are occasioaed by the likeness between the Antipholises and
Dromios, and are continued through five long Acts, produces an intricacy that perplexes, and a sameness that tires, an
audience. With a view to remedy these defects, the late Mr. Woods, of Edinburgh, reduced the Comedy to Three Acts
which, with further alterations, some additions from the original Drama, and the omission of all objectionable passages, is
now again presented to the Public.

Knaresbro3*

of

The principal events of tki* Drama are founded on historical fact. Eugene Aram was born at Ramsgill, in Netherdale, in
1704.
Possessing amazing resources of mind, literature was his favourite study ; and in the eonrae of years, he attained
a thorough knowledge of the classics, historians, and poets. On the 1st of August, 1758. a labourer digging for stone at
Thistle Hill, near Knaresbro', (where Aram had formerly resided as Schoolmaster) discovered part of a skeleton, which
many pronounced to be that of Daniel Clarke, • shoemaker, who had been missing for several years ; but one Richard
Houseman, a flax-dresser, being present, exclaimed, *' This is no more Daniel Clarke's bone than it is mine !" The resultwas, that Houseman confessed that Eugene Aram had murdered Clarke, and buried his body in St. Robert's Cave, where,
after dae search, the remains were found. Eugene Aram was, in consequence, committed to York Castle, tried, found
guilty, and hung in chain* in Knaresbro' Forest, August 6th, 1759.

Guy Ruthven, the natural Son of Sir John Trevanley, impelled by a resolution to avenge the wrongs of his
Mother, who had been seduced and abandoned by. his Father in early life, joins Hans Hattock, a reputed
Smuggler, but actually a Pirate, who has landed with his crew and pillaged the Castle in the absence of Sir John.
Ruthven's object being to carry off the Infant Heir, he is pursued by Lady Trevanley, who, frantic with dread,
is supposed to hav. fallen over the Cliffs and perished in the Sea, while Guy has* borne the Heir of Trevanley
on board the ' Rover.' The Boy proving dumb is brought up in a ineni-il station by the Pirates, from whom,
soon after the Drama commences, he has escaped, and is pursued on shore, where he takes refuge in TKLVANLEY CASTLE, and i. received by Sir John, unconscious of their natural affinity. Ruthven h^IR?
gratified his revenge, and afterwards fallen insane with remorse, has become a solitary Recluse in A RliDk
H U T , ON T H E CLIFFS. Here he is encountered by Hattock, in pursuit of the Boy, and then determines
to make the onl" reparation in his power bv restoring the dumb Heir to his Parent.

MR. THOMAS HOLMES,
Will make his First Appearance this Season, in Shakspear's sublime Tragedy of H A M L E T .

This Evening, W E D N E S D A Y , May 12th, 184T,
Her Majesty's Servants will perform Shakspear's celebrated Tragedy of

HAMLET.
PRINCE OF DENMARK.

'

Amongst the numberless beauties of the immortal Shakapear, none rank so pre-eminently high as this sublime Tragedy.
The awful and impressive meeting of Hamlet with the Ghost of his Father—his determination to obey his iniunctioas-^adrice to the Actors—Soliloquy on Death, " To be, or not to be," &c ,—the sublimity of the language in the Scene wkert
the Ghost appears a second time to warn Hamlet of his first request :
" Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
|
" Against thy mother aught;"—
The madness of Ophelia—and, in the 5th act, Hamlet's descantation in the church-yard over the grave of Yorick I
" Imperial Caesar, dead and turned to clay,
" Oh ! that that earth, which kept the world in awe.
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
Should patch a wall t' expel the winter', flaw!"
Iu the last scene, the encounter of Hamlet and Laertes—the death of the treacherous King, and the final close of the mortal
•areer of the unfortunate Prince of Denmark, with numerous other beauties, render this Play the first of dramatic enjoyments.

This Comedy was performed in Loudon to crowded houses lor upwards of 300 nights. One of the first critics of the
day, in reviewing it, observes, •• That without undue panegyrics, it would not be easy to overrate Mr. Knowies's merits ;
ke can afford to let his faults be counted up by envy, or his excellence exaggerated by friendship. In any case, his talents
we too sterling not to find their proper station in the literature of tiis country : and this Play will abide its fame through
many generations, who wiil yet witness its performance with renewed delight.

To conclude with the very laughable and Musical Faree, entitled

OF AGE TO-MORROW!

Thi. Farce was first produced at the Theatre Royal Covent Oarden, nearly half a century ago, and has retained its popularity to the pre.wat
oay, in ths leading London and Provincial Theatre*. The title is derived from the age of Frederick, who," just leaving his minority, propo«e.
te submit to government" in the m.trimonial state. The object of his affections, Sophia, i. the niece of Lady Brumback, a ridiculo. oU
»om*n of fortune, whose hand is solicited by Baron Pifflebnrg, an old fox-hunter; and the stratagems by which'Frederick endeavours to gain
admission to hi. mistress, furnish .he materials of the plot. These consist in the atuumption of various characters, in support ef which he i .
«a»d by Maris, an arch Waiting Maid. They a r . attended by many truly ludicrous circumstano and situations ; the result of which t. *
x.H>n.eto triumph over the sagacity of the old lady, and the union of Frederick and S.phia.

Her Majesty's Servants will perform (for the first time under the present Management) Shakspear'a Comedy of

TWELFTH NIGHT
OR,

irHAT YOir iriLL.

" Twelfth Night," it is aaid, waa th>> last production of Shakspeae. pes. If this statement be correct, it proves that bis rigour and playfulmean of wit and fancy continued unabated to .be last. As Schlegel justly observes, " it nnites the entertainment of an intrigue, contrived with
great ingenuity, to the richest fund of comic chare ci era and situations, and the beauteous colours of an ethereal poetry."
THE ARGUMENT—Sebastian and Viola, twin children of a gentleman of Messaline, and remarkable for an exact resemblance of
features, being deprived of both their parents, quit their native country ; they are encountered at sea by a violent tempest, which destroys the
vessel and most of the crew, while Viola, the captain, and a few passengers betake themselves to the boat, which conveys them in safety to t h .
sea-coast of Illyria. The ludy, thus deprived of her brother, clothes herself in male attire, and enters into the service of Prince Oraino, wh.
it at this time engaged in the unsuccessful pursuit of a neighbouring lady, named Olivia. The talents of the disguise I page soon render her
so great a fitvourite of her master, that she is selected to intercede with the obdurate Olivia ; who, though deaf to the solicitations of the prince,
is seized with a sudden passion for the domestic, which meets with a repulse. Viola, on her return home, ia waylaid by t foolish suitor of
Olivia, favored by her uncle, who persuade, him to challenge the youth, in order to beget in his mistress a favourable opinion of hi. courage.
Viola, as may well be supposed, is averse to a rencontre of this description ; when she is rescued from her embarraament by the arrival of.
aea captain, who, having saved her brother Sebastian from the wreck, and since supplied him with considerable sums of money for his exigea.
cies ; but, in consequence of an unexpected arrest, ia compelled to solicit moiety of the loan : he accordingly applies to Viola, believing that he
is addressing his friend ; and, wheu she denies all knowledge of his person, reproaches her with her ingratitude. In the mean time, Sebastian
arrives; and the foolish knight.with his confederate, supposing him to b . the page of Orsiuo, who had before declined the combat, assault him;
but their violence is repaid with interest, and the combatants are parted by Olivia, whose advances to the supposed page are now received
with mutual affection, and they are married without delay. Viola, arriving soon after with her master at the house of Olivia, ia mi stak.n by
the lady for her husband, by whose appearance the mystery is at length cleared up, and Viol, is united to the prince.

Will again Appear this Evening by PARTICULAR

DESIRE.

This p r e ^ e i i t E v e n ^ ^
Her Majesty's Servants will perform Shakspear's celebrated Comedy of The

Merry Wives of Windsor!

V
W r i t t e n by c o m m a n d of Queen Elizabeth, by W i l l i a m SbaJuspe&r.
T H E ARGUMENT.—The vanity of Sir John Falstaff having misinterpreted the hospitable attentions of two ladies at Windsor into an
admiration lor hi* person, he resolves te profit by his good fortane, but is betrayed by some discarded domestics, who revenue their dismissal
by revealing their master's designs to the husbands of bis mistresses. Page disregards the information altogether; while Ford, who had. for
some time past, entertained unfounded suspicions of his wife's honor, resolves to ascertain the trnth of the information- For this purpose,
under the assumed name of Brook, he causes himself to be introduced to Falstaff, whom he artfully draws into the confession of an assignation
which he had just before made with mistress Ford, who in the mean time had conspired with her friend t . punish the knight for his infamous
proposals. Ford, now supposing that he has sufficiently detected the infidelity of his wife, assembles h i . neighbours in order to surpris*
Falstaff at the appointed interview: he is, however, conreyed away by the two wives in a basket with foul linen, and thrown into t h .
Thames, where he narrowly escapes drowning. The suspicions of Ford are now somewhat abated ; bnt when he again repairs to Falstaff
as Brook, and learns the deception that has been practiced on him, and the arrangement, which have been made bv his wife for the second
visit from her admirer, his fury rekindles; he again solicits his friends to accompany him home, whence Falstaff is again conveyed in t h .
disguise of an old witch, though not without .offering a severe cudgelling at the hand, of the enraged Ford as a fortnne-teller.
A third
assignation is now made with him in Wind,or forest at midnight, where Falstaff, representing the spirit of a deceased huntsman, with horn.
on his head, is severely pinched by the accomplices of the plot in the garb of fairies and hobgoblins ; when the husbands, who are now mad. •
acquainted with the intention of their wives, rush from the place ol their concealment ; and, having sufficiently exposed and derided hira,
forgive him. The remainder of the Comedy is occupied by the rivalry of Slender and Cains for the hand of Page's daughter, who prefer, a
young gentleman named Fenton. whom she marries.

Mr. J. LANGFORD PRITCHARD,
Sole Lessee and Director of the York Theatrical Circuit.
Commencing each Evening at Half-past Seven o'Clock ; Half Price at Nine.
A CLERGYMAN'S APOLOGY FOR THE STAGE:—There U .omethiag in the word Playhotae which ,eems so elowsly connected,
in the minds of some people, with sin and Satan, that it stands in their vocabulary for every species of abomination. And yet, why ? Where
is every feeling more roosed in favo.r of virtue than at a good play ? Where is goodness so feelingly, so enthusiastically learnt? What so
solemn as to see the excellent passions of the human heart called fprtb by a great actor, animated by a great poet ? To hear Siddons repeat
what Shakspear wrote ! To behold the child, and it* mother—the noble, and the poor artizan—the monarch, and his subjects—all ages,
and all ranks, convulsed with one common anguish ; and, with load sobs and cries, doing involuntary homage to the God that made their
hearts ! What wretched infatuation, to interdict inch amusements as these! What a blessing, that mankind can be allured from sensual
gratification, and find relaxation and pleasure in such pursuits 1 But those who dub themselves " Evangelicals," are uniformly paltry and
narrow—always trembling at the idea of being entertained, and thinking no Christian safe who is not dull. As to the spectacles of impr.priety which are sometimes witnessed in parts of a Theatre, such reasons apply in a much stronger degree, to not driving along the Strand,
or any of the great public streets of London, after dark; and if the virtue of well-educated young people is made of such very frail materials,
their best resource is to a nunnery at once. It is a very bad rule, however, never to quit the house for fear of catshing cold.—Rev. Sydney
Smith .—Leeds Times, Saturday, August 7th, 1847.

This present Evening, F R I D A Y , 20th August, 184T,

1848,

Will be performed, (for the First Time under the present Management,) the first Four Acts of Shakspear's Play of

KING HENRY WL

The Play of Henry the Eighth is full ot incident; it comprises the disgrace and execution of the Duke of Buckingham • the trial and divorce
of Queen Katherine; the fall of Wolsey ; the Coronation of Anne Boleyn ; and the Birth and Christening of the Princess Elizabeth,
Witho.t exhibiting a more favourable portrait of Henry than was necessary, Shakspear has brought forward those better qualities, that now
and then broke through his native ferocity. But the Characters that more especially awaken our sympathy, ana display the poet's art, are
Katherine and W'olsey. In the one, we behold an affecting picture of courage, patience, and resignation ; in the other, a great mind foils...
by its own pride and ambition, brought by adversity to a right estimation of worldly gran leur, and appearing glorious only in its fall.

** Love should Reek its match ; and that is love

In things resembling thein.
Th>>y are not lo»e 1
C.lines love (that subtle essence, without which
Lit.1 were but a leaden dalness ' weariness !
A plodding trodger on a heavy road %-)
Comes it of title deeds which fools may boast f
Or coffers vilest hands may hold the key of?
Or that ethereal lamp that lights the eyes
T:> .-hed their sparkling lustre o'er the faie.
Gives to the velvet skin its b'ushing glow.
And burns as bright beneath the peasant's roof
As root of palaced p r i n c e ! "

*• \ on describe
T h e h u n t s m a n ' s pastime to the life ! "
- I love it.
T o wood and ".;len, hamlet and town, it is
A laughmsf holiday t X«t . bill top
But i* then alive ! Kimtmeii and horsemen vie.
All earth's astir, ron..eJ with the revelry
<)1 vigour, h e a l t h , aiid-joy ! I heer awakes cheer,
Whi e echo's mimic tongue, that uever tires.
Keeps up tin* hearty din ! Each face is llien
l u neighbour'* g a s s - w h e r e gladness «ees itself,
And at the bright reflection, grows more gla.l !
Breaks into tenfold mirib ' l.angbs like a child!
Would malt • a grief of its heart, it is so free !

Shake* hands with al , and vows it never knew

Her Majesty's Servants will perform the Petite Comedy b y - J o h n Baldwin Buckstone, Esq., Author o f Luke the
Labourer," " Popping the Question," " Winning a Husband," " The Ice Witch," & c , entitled

SNAKES IN THE GRASS!

There are those who, under the fairest pretences, mask the most insidious designs, whose exterior is mild and conciliatory, but whose breath is venom and poison. Such are, for the most part, busy intermeddlers, who live but in the
broils they provoke; and the " be-all," and "end-all," of whose existence is, to mar the happiness they seem incapable
of sharing.—To such, the very significant term of "Snakes in the Grass," has been aptly applied, and from whose s'ing
innocence itself is not secure. " Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape Calumny."
Your practised slanderer seldom ventures on a direct charge, for fear of being compelled to the proof.—Mis
weapons are nods, winks, and inuendos: compassion is his favourite figure of speech—he insinuates the worst; and
charitably hopes the best! He bears the extinguisher, yet blows the flame; and carries the olive-branch in one hand,
and a dagger in the other.—Like Mrs. Candour, he is never so dangerous as when he undertakes your defence. Secure
his hostility, and you partially disarm him; enlist him as your friend, and, like the nettle gently touched, he stings you
for your pains.
The Orchestra will play the Overture to " ITALIAN

This Evening, SATURDAY, Jnly 8th, 1848,
Her Majesty's Servants will perform O'Keeffe's much admired Petite Comedy, called The

PRISONER AT LARGE.

T h e story of the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse comprise, nearly all that can be said upon the subject of liberty—
" Our friend, Matt Prior, told, you know,
" A tale extremely apropos."
If the freedom of locomotion—of living how we please and where we please, be denied us, of what use are the good gifts of fortune ? Certain
political wiseacres have raised a patriotic outcry against absenteeism.
They propose that a tax shall be levied on all who derive their wealth
from one country and spend it in another. Thus a m a n who, in its utmost need, lent his money to the state cannot avail himself of foreign
travel (a power which Aw cash in part has purchased) without paying over again for his privilege. Some would draw the string even still
tighter, a n d , b y means of this invidious penalty, compel every landlord to domicile upon his own .state, even though it should be situated in
the centre of a bog, and bounded *n all sides by tire and sword.
This D r a m a i , a s o t h . r of 0'Ke.ffe's farcical blossoms. Lord Esmond having lost his estate to a club of Parisian .harpers, is arrested,
and become, the Prisoner at large of T r a p , an accommodating Bailiff, who s.ffers him to revisit his native island, to see how matters have
- o n e on during his ten years' absence. H e finds his estate in the hands of Dowdle his ouendam Steward, who has promised to pay the r e n t .
t . Count Fripon, one of the sharping crew, on condition that he (the Count marries his daughter Rachel, a free-hearted Irish lass, who h a s
already secured to herself a lover in the person of J a c k Connor, a genuine son of the emerald isle. Dowdle is called from home, and during
his absence, Rachel invites J a c k and a party of trieuds to sup with her, promising them a jovial evening. T h . table is spread, the guests are
assembled, when old Dowdle (who has been thrown from his h o n e ) suddenly makes his appearance, and a scene of confusion indescribably
ludicrous ensures. Another part of the story relates to the loves of Lord Esmond and Adelaide, which give rise to some highly a m u s i . g
seen...

OLYMPIC.—Mr. Lysander Thompson, whose debtit in Tyke, i n " The School of Reform," we noticed a week
or two ago, made his appearance on Wednesday Evening, in the part of Zekiel Homespun, in " T h e Heir at
Law," and fiilly justified the opinion we formed on his first appearance. As the delineator of rustic characters,
he stands alone ; the stage has not his equal. H e is a s unrivalled in this particular walk of the drama, as Mr.
Macready is in the highest rank of Tragedy. Nothing can surpass the excellence of both his T y k e and his
Zekiel Homespun. 1 hey belong to that class of exquisite personation which criticism can scarcely do more than
record. H e comes on the stage with a naivete so inimitable, a n d an effect so irresistibly ludicrous, as to
immediately take possession of, and establish himself with, his audience.
" With steady face, and sober hummmma mien,
The very man, in loot, in voice, nnd air,
lie trod the o.tlines of the comic scene,
And, th.,' upon the sage, appeared no
-player.
T h e manner in which Mr. Thompson " makes u p " t h e personages he represents is almost sufficient to stamp
him a man of genius. Throughout the whole of his performance, there is not the least appearance of art—no
straining after effect, no mannerism or stage trickery, but all is natural, and kept within the bounds of moderation. His dialect, action, and good-humoured grin, are all in strict keeping with the character of the unsophisticated artless countryman. I n scenes of pathos and tenderness, he is equally as successful as in the comic and
more bustling portion of his performance; and he never offends by approaching to anything like buffoonery or
extravagance. T h e audience were delighted with his Zekiel H o m e s p u n , and called loudly for him at t h e termination of the Comedy. Mr. T h o m p s o n is announced to appear in a n original part in a new drama, an event
which we look forward to with some interest.— Times.

On Monday Evening, 31st July, 1848.

To couc'uJe with Buckstone's popular Coruedy, in two acts, called

SNAKES IN THE GRASS!
THERE are those who, under the fairest pretences, mask the most insidious designs, whose exterior is mild and conciliatorv.
but whose breath is venom and poison.
Such are, for the most part, busy intermeddlers, who live but in the b/oils they
provoke; and the " be-all," and " end-all," of whose existence is, to mar the happiness they seem incapable ofsharintr.
To such, the very significant term of " Snakes in the Grass," has been aptly applied, and from whose sting innocence itself
is not secure. " Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape Calumny."
Your practised slanderer seldom ventures on a direct charge, for fear of being compelled to the proof. His weapons are
nods, winks, and inuencios ; compassion is his favourite figure of speech—he insinuates the worst; and charitably hopes the
best J He bears the extinguisher, yet blows the flame ; and carries the olive-branch in one hand, and a dagger in the other.
Like Mrs. Candour, he is never so dangerous as when he undertakes your defence. Secure his hostility, and you partially
disarm him ; enlist him as your friend, and like the nettle gently touched, he stings you for your pains. And
" With hard words, jealousies, and fears,
|
Sets folk together by the ears."
Upon this hint, that clever writer, Buckstone, has constructed an admirable little Comedy, which keeps the Audience
in a roar.

A Legend of StfUroaia informs us of the existence of a Drama called " THE DANCE OF THE WILIS." The Wilis are young damsels who
being betrothed, have the misfortune to die before they become brides, and are supposed tofindno repose in their graves. For, though no lonrer
in human existence, the insatiable fascination of dancing perturbs and rccttfs to moonlight revelry their unquiet ghosts. At midnight, and in ihe
calm beams of the silver planet, they rise from their turfy beds, arrayed in their bridal garew» ts, crowned with garlands and radiant with elitterin*
gems. Pale, but Mill wearing the beauty of youth, their lips adorned with lovely smiles. Alas! for the unhappy youth who encounters their
mystic blandishments ; once within the circle of the.r bewitching spells, he has no power tofly,but wtuifted around and around in the mail ac
turnal dance, at length sinks, overcome by the frantic orgies of the neventiring Wilis, and expires of exhaustion.

Thus Sarah's labouring feelings trace
| The pallid cheek and brow confess'd
, That pang the painful slumber broke
Strange feelings in her sleeping face j
That grief was busy in her breast;
And Sarah, with a start, awoke.
There might be seen of shame the blush,
Nor passed that mood—a sudden start
Feat ires convulsed, and muttering, dread,
There auger's dark andfiercerflush:
Impelled the life-blood from the heart.
Show terror reigns in sorrow's stead.

with horror, Wilford attempts to fly the C'as le, but falling into the bauds of Uauditti. is again conducted to Sir Edward, who, anxious to
accomplish his destruction, accuses him of Robbery ; the proofs a r e strong, and the unhappy j o u l h is about to be condemned, when the h a n d

And see the dread effects of lawless love:
Falls the .ad victim of his trait'rous art,
Learn, 'tis no single crime, the mischief spreads

To all the dearest ties of social life.

The following remarks from the pen of a dramatic critic, in relation to this popular Piece, may not prove uninteresting—
" Among the naval Lyrics that roused and kept alive the ardent spirits of our gallant seamen, is ' My Poll and My Partner
Joe.' We remember when every true British heart beat to this national melody—once so sweetly vocal. I t is now truly
instrumental in filling many eves with tears, and attracting thousands to witness its representation. The Drama'is as truly
national as the t>ong, and promises to rival it in popularity. The British Tar • bold as mars—brawny as'Hercules.' and
true to nature in every sense, is truly depicted. The Author has chosen a happy subject, and it well deserves thejunprecedented success that has attended its'production."

Or, The French

Washerwoman.

The appetite for scandal is equally common to France as England—so thought the writer of this Dramatic Bagatelle, the humour of which solely
depends on the inventive faculties of Madame Manette, piincipal laundress to the village of St. Heny. She is quite an/ait in the art and mysterv
of scandalizing—first inventing a tale, then affecting to disbelieve it ; just givin? the outline to her three sisters-in-law, whispering it to her
godfather, delicately insinuating it to some half dozen of her most intimate frit-nds, who, in an unguarded moment, confidently pop it out in their
turn. She sets two lovers by the ears on their wedd'ng-day,—get. up a Battle Royal, with the usual accompaniments of knock-dowa blows,
scratched faces, screams, and fainting fits,—transforms a plain soldier on foot into a military adonis, a fifty thousand pound capitalist in a carriage
and right! and, hey presto, as soon degrades him into a poverty-stricken scarecrow, with ao shirt, half a pair of breeches, and a coat without
•Jeeves, begging a penny of the Mayor to carry him on his journey. Her inveterate passion for the marvellous embroils her with her sister
laundresses, and justice is awarded her by pulling of caps and other annoyances. Tiie lovers are united, and their foretaste of quarrelling wilr
.nly bring them better prepared for action in the event pf a conjugal brash.

HAMLET P R I N C E OF DENMARK.

This present T U E S D A Y Evening, 8th May, 1849,
H e r Majestr's Servants will perform Shakspear's celebrated Tragedy of

HAMLET

Amongst the numberless beauties of the immortal Shakspear. none rank *o pre-eminently high as this sublime Tragedy.—
There is nothing in the whole circle of the Drama, ancient or modern, that can in any way be compared with Hamlet. It
stands alone, a class of itself; its collossal greatness mocks all efforts at comparison ; it would be as easy a task to take
the heights of the Andes with a pair of compasses. No praise can truly speak its merits. " Ages cannot wither it, nor
custom stale its infinite variety." The awful and impressive Meeting of Hamlet with the Ghost of his Father—his determination to obey his injunctions—Advice to the Actors—-Soliloquy on Death, " To be, or not to be," &c.—the sublimity of the
language in the scene where the Ghost appears a second time to warn Hamlet of his first reqeust :
•' Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Again-,, thy mother ought."
The madness of Ophelia ; and, in the 5th act, Hamlet's descantation in the church-yard over the grave of Yorick :
" Imperial Caesar, dead and turned to clay,
Oh ! that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
Should patch a wall 1 expel the winter'sflaw!"
In the last Scene, the encounter of Hamlet and Laertes j the death of the treacherous King, and the final close of the mortal,
career of the unfortunate Prince of Denmark, with numerous other beauties, render this Play the first of dramatic enjoyments

Will be performed the celebrated Tragedy of

THE GAMESTER!
Or, The False Friend.

Written by Dr. Edward Moore.
In the progress of this admirable Play the finest feelings of Ihe human breast are alternately roused to the highest pitta
cf tenderness and the very acme of distress. The language is energetic and sublime. The circumstances desoribed are
those of an amiable family plunged into the most agonizing affliction by the destructive practice of Cawing. To curb this
vice, and gua,<i against its evil, become, the duty of the Moral st and Public Lecturer, though none can so effectually picture its enormities a* those wUa " hold the mirror up to nature, to show vice its own image, and the very age and body
of time, its form and pressure."
Here may the Gamester learn, ere yet too late,
Oh ! should a father or a husband come.
To shun that vice which endless ills await;
Whom Dice has lured from happiness and home,
Wild ad the sea, his maddening passions
flow.
To listen to our tale—our happiness is here.
Himself, wife, children, beggar'd at a throw.
To check one Gamester in his mad career.
