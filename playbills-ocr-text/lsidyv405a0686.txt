the Flies and Intects and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place. The discomfited Wasp joins the festivities with hie friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; -when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demands of the Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of hit
bottle ; when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leaflets trees, frozen
rivers, and falling snow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold; but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Genius
of Spring, appears, and with her warm rays, revive* the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
enemies, changes the Grasshopper into Harlequin, and the Butterfly into Columbine. The Witch sends the Wasp and the
Spider in pursuit of them, as Clown and Pantaloon ; when, after many esctpes and trials, the Butterfly and the Grasshopper
are united, and live happy ever after.

T H E STORY O F * T H B P A N T O M I M E :
The rl asp being rejected by the fair
Butteifly,
Lady Silverwings,
who is in love and betrothed
to the
Grasshopper,
waits upon B-lladomia,
the poison witch, to obtain a deadly poison,
wherewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends, whom she has invited to a Ball and I-east given by her and the Grasshopper
in honor of their approaching
nuptials.
Belladonna
supplies him with the poison ; but (he base plot is 01 erheard by Brightray,
the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies,
who tells them she will do all in her power to baffle the foul design.
Btightray
repairs to the Butterfly s
Haunt, where she promises
protection to Silveritings,
saves the Butterflies
from the efforts of Master Robert and his compan ions to catch them, and gives permission to Sih erwings to meet her lot er, the Grasshopper,
at their trysting place.
Here
the lovers are interrupted
by the malice of their enemies, the If asp and the Fpider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The Wasp, on his way to the /east, to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings,
hoping to find an opportunity
of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet;
but the cooks seeing a Wasp
upon the premises,
make desperate
efforts to catch him, but in vain.
After a setere chase the Wasp escapes, but in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison.
Thp, trumpeter,
Gadfly, calls all the guests to the feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and Insects and Animals proceed in procession
to the grass-green
lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place.
The discomfited
Wasp joins the festivities
with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin I when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna
appears, and demands of the Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of hie
bottle i when the Witch immediately
changes the beautiful
summer landscape
into a winter one, with leafless trees,
frotten
rivers, and falling
snow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold; but the good friend
of the Butterflies,
the Genius
of Spring,
appears,
and with her warm rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
enemies, changes the Grasshopper
into Harlequin,
and the Butterfly
into Columbine.
Ihe Witch sends the Wasp and theSpider in pursuit of them, as Clown and Pantaloon ; when, after many escapes and trials, the Butterfly and the
Grasshopper
are united, and live happy ever after.

FITZ WILLI AM.

The Hasp being rejected by the fair
Butterfly,
Lady Silverwings,
who it in love and betrothed
to tlm
Grasshopper,
waits upon Belladonna,
the poison witch, to obtain a deadly potion,
wherewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends,
whom she has invited to a Bait and Feast given by her and the Grasshopper
in honor of their approaching
nuptials.
Belladonna
supplies
him with the poison ; but the base plot is overheard
by Brtghttay,
the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies,
who tells them she will do all in her power to baffle the foul design.
Bnghtrav
repairs to the Butterfly s
Haunt, where she promises
protection to Silreruings,
saves the Butterflies
from the efforts of Master Robert and his companions
to catch them, and gives permission to Silverwings
to meet her later, the Grasshopper,
at their trysting place.
Here
the lovers are interrupted
by the malice tf their enemies, the If asp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The Wasp, on his way to the feast,
to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings,
hoping to find an opportunity
of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet;
but the cooks seeing m Wasp
upon the premises,
make
desperate
efforts to catch him, but in vain.
After a severe chase the Wasp escapes, but in the
encounter
breaks his bottle of poison.
The trumpeter,
Gadfly, calls all the guests to Urn Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and Insects and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green
lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place.
The discomfited
Wasp Joins the festivities
with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin # when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demands of the Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of his
bottle ; when the Witch immediately
changes the beautiful
summer landscape
into a winter one, witk leaflets trees,

T H E STORY O F T H E P A N T O M I M E :
The Hasp
being rejected by the fair
Butterfly,
Lady Silrerwings,
who is in lore and betrothed
to the
Grasshopper
waits upon Belladonna,
the poison witch, to obtain a deadly poitun,
therewith
he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends,
whom she has invited to a Bolt and Feast gixen by her and the Grasshopper
in honor of their approaching
nuptials.
Belladonna supplits
him with the poiaon ; but the base plot i? oierheard
by Briqhttay,
the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butter/lies,
who tells them she will do oil in her power to baffle the foul design.
Biightray
repairs to the Butterfly s
Haunt, where she promises
protection to Silverwings,
saves the Butterflies
from the efforts of Master Robert and his compontons
to catch them, and g r a f t permission to Sihermngs
to meet her lover, the Grasshopper,
at their trysting place,
fieri
the lovers are interrupted
by the malice of their enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The Watp, on his way to the feast,
to which he has been invtted, looks in at the kitchen af the Lady
Sikerwings,
hoping to find an opportunity
of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet;
but the cooks seeing a Wasp
upon the premises,
make
desperate
efforts to catch him, but M tain.
After a severe rhase the Wasp escapes, out in the
encounter
breaks his bottle of poison.
The trumpeter,
Gadfly, calls all the guests to the Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and Infects and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green
lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
plat.
The discomfited
Wasp joins the feHivities
with hie friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst of
thetr mirth, Belladonna appears, and demands of the Watp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of hit
battle I when the Witch immediately
changes the beautiful
summer landscape
into a winter one, with leaflets trees,
froxen
rivers, and falling
snow.
All the party become torpid and dead with cold; but the good friend
of the Butterflies, the Genius
of Spring,
appears,
and with her mat m rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
enemies, changes the Grasshopper
into Harlequin,
and the Butterfly into Columbin-.
The Witch sendt the Wasp and the
Spider in pursuit of them, as Clown and Pantaloon t when.after
many escapes and trials, the Butterfly and the
Grasshopper
are united, and live happy ever after.

the Butter/lies, who tells them the will do alt tn her power to baffle the foul design. Btightray repatrs to the Butterfly $
Haunt, where she promise* protection to Silrerwings, sattes the Butter/lies from the efforts of Matter Robert and his companions to catch them, end gives permission to Silterwings to meet her lover, the Grasshopper, at their trytting place. Here
the lover* are interrupted by the malice of thtir enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of

upon the premises, make desperate efforts to catch him, but tn tain.
After a severe chase the Wasp escapes, out in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison.

And the revels are now only waiting for you."

Q

T H E STORY O F T H E P A N T O M I M E :
The Wasp being rejected by the fair Butterfly, Lady Silreruings, who it in love and betrothed to the Grasshopper
waits upon Belladonna, the poison witch, to obtain a deadly poison, u herewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and ail her
friends, whom she has invited to a Ball and Feast given by her and the Grasshopper in honor of their approaching nuptials.
Belladonna supplies him with the poison : but the base plot is overheard by Brightray, the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies, who tells them she will do all in her power to baffle the foul design. Brightray repairs to the Butterfly $
Haunt, where she promises protection to Silverwings, saves the Butterflies from the efforts of Master Robert and his companions to catch them, and gives permission to Siherwings to meet her lover, the Grasshopjwr, at their trysting place.
Here
the lovers are interrupted by the malice of their enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The Wasp, on his way to the feast, to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings, hoping to find an opportunity of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet,' but the cooks seeing a Wasp
upon the premises, make desperate efforts to catch him, but in tain.
After a severe chase the Wasp escapes, but in the
encounter brinks his bottle of poison. The trumpeter, Gadfly, calls all the guests to the Feast by a blast of hit trumpet, and
the Flies and Insects and Animals proceed in procession to the grais-gven lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
plaae. The discomfited Wasp joins the festivities with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demand* of the Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who t<.<\ her of the fate of hi*
bottle ; when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leaflets trees, frozen
rivers, and falling snow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold ; but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Genius
ef Spring, appears, and with her warm rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
enemies, changes the Grasshopper into Harlequin, and the Butterfly into Columbine, The Witch sends the Watp and the
Spider in pursuit of them, as Clown and I'antalonn ; when,after many escapes and trials, the Butterfly and the Grasshopper
are united, and live happy ever after.

CALLCOTT.

The Wasp being rejected by the fair Butterfly, Lady Silverwings, who it in love and betrothed to the Gratshapp,
waitt upon Belladonna, the poison witch, to obtain a deadly potion, wherewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
h
friends, whom she has invited to a Bull and Feast given by her and the Grasshopper in honor of their approaching nuptials.
Belladonna supplies him with the poison; but the bate plot is overheard by Bright ay, the Oeniui of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies, who tells them she will do all in her power to baffle the foul design, Brightray repairs to the Butterfly s
Haunt, where she promises protection to Silverwings, save* the Butterflies from the efforts of Master Robert and his companions to catch them, and gives permission to Silverwings to meet her lover, the Grasshopper, at their trysting place. Here
'a* *^"j* r * art interrupted by the malice of their enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
vl Gra.ts,lafPer5T%« "asp, on his way to the feast, to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings, hoping to find an opportunity of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet; but the cooks seeing m Wasp
upon the premises, make desperate efforts to catch him, but in vain.
After a severe chase the Wasp escapes, but in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison. The trumpeter, Gadfly, calls all the guests to the Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and Insects and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place. The discomfited Wasp joins the festivities with hit friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst of
thetr mirth, Belladonna appears, and demands of the Wasp the use he hat made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of his
bottle; when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter me, with leaflet* trees, frozen
ruers, and falling snow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold ; but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Genius
of Spring, appears, and with her warm rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
tnemiei, changes the Grasshitpper into Harlegui*, and the Butterfly into Columbine. The Witch sends the Wasp and the
Spider^ in pursuit of them, a* Clown and Pantiloon ; when, after many escapes and trials, the Butterfly and the Grasshopper
are united, and live happy ever after.

THE STORY O P T H E PANTOMIME:
The If asp being rejected by the fmir Butterfly, Lady SUverwings, who it in love and betrothed to the Grasshopper
waits upon Belladonna, the poison witch, to obtain a deadly poison, wherewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends, whom she has invited to a Ball and Feast given by her and the Grasshopper in honor of their approaching nuptials.
Belladonna supplies him with the poison ; but the base plot is overheard by Brightray, the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies, who tells them she will do all in her power to baffle the foul design. Brightray repairs to the Butterfly s
Haunt, where she promises protection to Stiverwings, saves the Butterflies from the efforts of Master Robert and his companions to catch them, and gives permission to Sikerwings to meet her lover, the Grasshopper, at their trysting place.
Here
the lovers are interrupted by the malice of their enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The Wasp, on his way to the feast, to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings, hoping to find an opportunity of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet! but the cooks seeing a Wasp
upon the premises, make desperate efforts to eatch him, but in eain. After a severe chase the Wasp escapes, out in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison. The trumpeter, Gadfly, calls all the guests to the Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and Insects and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place. Tke discomfited Wasp joins the feetivities with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demand* of the Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of his
bottle ; when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leafless trees, frozen
riven, and falling mow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold; but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Genius
of Spring, appears, and with her warm rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
enemies, changes the Grasshopper into Harlequin, and the Butterfly into Columbin;
The Witch sends the Wasp and the

the levers are interrupted by the mmlke of their enemies, the If asp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper. The Wasp, on hit way to the feast, to which he hat been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings, hoping to find an opportunity of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet,- but the cooks seeing a Wasp
upon the premises, make desperate efforts to catch him, but in vain. After a severe chase the If asp escapes, out in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison. The trumpeter. Gadfly, calls all the guests to the Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and Insects and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place. The discomfited Wasp jams the festivities with hit friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ,• when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demands of the Wasp the use he hat made of the poison, who tell* her of the fate of his
bottle i when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leafless trees-, froeen*5f2j &*d falling snow. AU the party l-ecome torpid and dead with cold ,• but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Gtniut

STORY O F T H E P A N T O M I M E .

• ,

The Wasp being rejected by the fair Butterfly, Lady Silverwings, who is in love and betrothed to the Grasshopper
waits upon Belladonna, the poison witch, to obtain a deadly poison, wherewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends, whom she has invited to a Boll and feast given by her and the Grasshopper in honor oftheir approaching nuptial*.
Belladonna supplies him with the poison ; but the base plot is overheard by Brightray, the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies, who tells them she will do oil in her power to baffle the foul design. Brightray repairs to the Butterfly s
Haunt, where she promises protection to Silverwings, saves the Butterflies from the efforts of Master Robert and his companions to catch them, and gives permission to Siherwings to meet her lover, the Grasshopper, at their trysting place.
Here
the lovers are interrupted by the malice « / their enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The Wasp, on his way to the feast, to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings, hoping to find an opportunity of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet; but the cooks seeinga Wasp
upon the premises, make desperate efforts to catch him, but in vain.
After a severe chase the Wasp escape', but in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison. The trumpeter, Gadfly, calls all the guests to the Feast by a blast of hit trumpet, and
the Flies and Intects and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place. The discomfited Wasp joins the festivities with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demands cfttie Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of hts
bottle 'i when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leafless trees, froxen
rivers, and falling snow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold ; but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Genius
of Spring, appears, and with her waim rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
eneWies, changes the Grasshopper into Harlegu^,
and the Butterfly into Columbine. The Witch sends the Wasp and the
Spider in pursuit of them, as Clown and Pantaloon ; v>hen, of lev many escapes and trials, the Butterfly and the Grasshopper
are united, and live happy ever after.

T H E STORY O F T H E

PANTOMIME:

The Wasp being rejected by the fair Butterfly, Lady Silrerwings, who is in love and betrothed l» the Grasshopper
wtite upon Belladonna, the poison witch, to obtain a deadly potion, wherewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends, whom she has invited to a Ball and leant given by her and the Grasshopper in honor of tneir approaching nuptials.
Belladonna supplies him with the poison ; but the base plot is overheard by Bright'ay, the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies, who tells them she will do oil in. her power to baffle the foul design, Biiyhtray repairs to the Butterfly s
Haunt, where the promises protection to Silrerwings, saves the Butterflies from the efforts of Master Robert and hi* com
panions to catch them, and gives permission to Silrerwings to meet her loter, the Grasshopper, at thtir trysling place. Here
the lovers are interrupted by the malice of /A. ir enemies, the H'nsp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The Wasp, on his way to the /east, to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings, hoping to find an opportunity of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet; but the cooks serins m Wasp
upon the premises, make desperate efforts to catch him, but in vain. After a severe chase the Wasp escapes, out in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison. The trumpeter, Gadfly, calls all the guests to tlte Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flits and Insects and Animals proceed in piocession to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place. The discomfited Wasp join* the festivities with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst of
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demands of the Wasp the use he hat made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of km
bottle i when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leafless trees, frozen
fivers, and falling snow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold ; but the good friend tif the Butterflies, the Genius
of Spring, appear*, and with her wai m rays, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
enemies, change* the Grasshopper into Harlequin, and the Butterfly into Columbine. The Witch send* the Wasp and the
Spider in pursuit of them, as Clown and Pantaloon ; when, after many escipes and trials, the Butterfly and the Gratshojiper
are united, and live happy ever after.

Belladonna supplies him with the pi "
the Butterflies, who tells them the t

the Grasshopper.
The Watp, on his way to the (east, to which he has been invited, look* in at the kitchen of the Lady

their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demand* of the Watp the use he hie made of the poison, who tell* her of the fate of hi*
bottle/ when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leaflets trees, frozen

TILE STORY OF THE PANTOMIME:
The Wasp being rejected by the fair Butterfly, Lady Silverwings, who is in love and betrothed to the Grasshopper
waits upon Belladonna, the poison witch, to obtain a deadly poison, wherewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends, whom she has invited to a Bolt and Feast given by her and the Grasshopper in honor of their approaching nuptials.
Belladonna supplies him with the poison: but the base plot is overheard by Brightray, the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies, who tells them she will do all in her power to baffle the foul design. Biightray repairs to the Butterfly s
Haunt, where she promises protection to Silverwings, saves the Butterflies from the efforts of Master Robert and his companions to catch them, and gives permission to Sfhertrings to meet her later, the Grasshopper, at their trysting place.
Here
the lovers are interrupted by the malice of their Enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery of
the Grasshopper.
The If asp, on his way to # e feast, to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings, hoping to find an opportunity of peisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet; but the cooks seeing a Wasp
upon the premises, make desperate efforts to catch him, but in vain. After a severe chase the Wasp escapes, but in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison. The trumpeter, Gadfly, calls all the guests to the Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and Imetts and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place. The discomfited Wasp joins the festivities with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst oj
their mirth. Belladonna appears, and demands of the IVasp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of his
bottle} when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, tvith leafless trees, frozen
rivers, and falling snow. All the party become torpid and dead with cold ; but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Genius
of Spriv r, appears, and with her warm rays, revives the Flies and Insects; and, to secure them against the spite of their
enemies, changes the Grasshopper into Harlequin, and the Butterfly into Columbine. The Witch sends the Wasp and the
Spider in pursuit of them, as Clown and Pantaloon; when, after many escapes and tria'ft, the Butterfly and the Grasihojiper

OALLOOTT.

T H E STORY O F T H E P A N T O M I M E :
The Wasp being rejected by the fair Butterfly, Lady Silverwings, who is in lore and betrothed to the Grasshopper
waits upon Belladonna, the poison witch, to obtain a deadly poison, wherewith he may kill the lady, her lover, and all her
friends, whom she has invited to a Bait and feast given by her and the Grasshopper in honor of their approaching nuptials.
Belladonna supplies him with the poison ; but the base plot is overheard by Brightray, the Genius of Spring and friend of
the Butterflies, who tells them she will do all in her power to baffle the foul design. Brightray repairs to the Butterfly t
Haunt, where she promises protection to 8'dverwing*, saves the Butterflies from the efforts of Master Robert and his companions to catch them, and gives permission to Siltetwings to meet her lover, the Grasshopper, at their trysting place.
Here
tke lovers are interrupted by the malice of their enemies, the Wasp and the Spider, who are put to the rout by the bravery Of
the Grasshopper.
The Wasp, on his way to the feast, to which he has been invited, looks in at the kitchen of the Lady
Silverwings, hoping to find an opportunity of poisoning all the dishes intended for the banquet; but the cooks seeing a Wasp
upon the premises, make desperate efforts to catch him, but in vain. After a severe chase the Wasp escapes, but in the
encounter breaks his bottle of poison. The trumpeter, Gadfly, calls all the guests to tke Feast by a blast of his trumpet, and
the Flies and In>.ects and Animals proceed in procession to the grass-green lawn, beneath a broad oak, where the revels take
place. Tke discomfited Wasp joins the festivities with his friend the Spider, much to their chagrin ; when, in the midst oj
their mirth, Belladonna appears, and demand* of the Wasp the use he has made of the poison, who tells her of the fate of his
bottle i when the Witch immediately changes the beautiful summer landscape into a winter one, with leafless trees, frozen
rivers, and falling mow. .* " 'he party become torpid and dead with cold ; but the good friend of the Butterflies, the Genius
of Spring, appears, and *».... her warm ray*, revives the Flies and Insects ; and, to secure them against the spite of their
enemies, changes the Grasshopper into Harlequin, and the Butterfly into Columbine. Hie Witch sends the Wasp and the
Spider in pursuit of them, m* Clown and Pantaloon f when,after many escapes and tria'p, the Butterfly and the Gratshojiper
ore united, and lint happy ever after.
