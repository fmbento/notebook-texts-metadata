SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL—PEEPINÔ TOM.	•
This excellent Comedy can never fail of attraction, while there is any taste to be found in the s town ; it is impossible to see it without wishing that its author would add fresh fame to his cha- , racter, as a Dramatic Writer, by producing something new.
Though the cast of the School for Scandal has suffered by the death of poor Parsons, yet the characters are so ably supported, as to set cynical Criticism at defiance ; no praise can be too great . for Miss Farren, King, and Palmer, in Lady and Sir Peter Teazle, and Joseph Surface ; Wathen too, was respectable in Moses.	"""
The very laughable Farce which followed was , played for the first time at this House, and with deserved applause. The character of Maud, in which Mrs. S. Kemble has so often pleased us at the Little Theatre, was given to Mrs. Bland, and she did ample justice to it.
J. Bannister was full of spirits, and consequently very entertaining.
The House was very full.

Bv the King.
A Proclamation For pardoning fitch Seamen and Marines of the muadron of his Majefty’s fleet Rationed at Spithead, as have been guilty of any aft of mutiny or difobedicnce of orders, or any breach or negleft of duty, and who fhall, upon notification of fueh Proclamation on board their rel'peftive Ihips, return to the regular and ordinary dif-charge of their duty.
George R.
Upon the report of the LcrdsCommif-fionersefthe Admiralty, of the proceedings of the Seamen and Marines of the fquadrou of our fleet Rationed at Spit-hcad, and of the nuafures taken by the faid Lords Commillioners in confe-qutnee thereof ; and in order to mani-feft our defire to give due encouragement to all thofc who lhall return to the regular and ordinary dil'charge of their duty, according to the rules and praftice of the Navy ; we have thought fit, by the advice of our Prt»y Council,
to ¡flue this our Royal Proclamation, and do hereby promife our moft gracious Pardon to all Seamen and Marines ferv-ing on board the faid fquadron, who ihall, upon notification hereof on hoard their refpeftive (hips, return to the regular and ordinary dilcharge of their duty ; and we do hereby declare, that all luch Seamen and Marines, fo returning to their duty, (hall be difeharg-ed and releafed from all profecutions, imprifunments, and penalties, incurred by reafon of any aft of mutiny or difo-bedience of orders, or any breach or negleft of duty, tirevioully committed by them, or any of them.
Given at our Court at Windfor, the iad day of April 1797, and in the 37th year of our reign.
God lave the King.
On the 7th of May this unfortunate difpute was renewed, from the circum-ftance of the Sailors having been led to fuppofc that Government had broken its faith with them, and that the promif-ed redrefsof grievances was intended to be withheld. As, however, through the perfonal interference of Lord Howe, and from an Aft having pafiedin compliance with the wilhesofthe Seamen, the Mutiny feems to be now perfeftty at an end, we think it advifeable to forbear detailing any further particulars of fo un-plcalant an affair.

Mandcvilte, who, with the wildnefs of youth, poffeffed an excellent heart, having involved himfelf in debt, and offended his lather, alter the death of his wife, goes in puifuit ot fortune to India, leaving his infant daughter, Albina, to the care of Mrs. Rigid, an artful old woman. During his ablence, lie coiftantly remitted to
Vol. XXXI. May 1797-
Mrs. Rigid three hundred pounds a-Year tor the tupport of her and his daughter. The old woman conceals the fupplies fent to her, and throws herfeif upon the pro'-teftion of Albina’s grandfather, whom ihe contrives fo to incenfe againft his fon, that when the old man dies he dilinherits his fon, and leaves all his fortune to his grand-daughter Albina. It appears that Mrs. Rigid, who afiumes the entire con-troul over Albina, has entered into an agreement with Veritasj the Tntot1 of George Howard, a young gentleman who lives in the neighbourhood, by which, if the effiefts a marriage between the Tutor and Albina, Veritas is to give this corrupt Governeis half of the Mandeville eltatcs, amounting to five thoufand pounds a-year. Albina, however, is attached to Howard, and is beloved by the latter. In this ftate of affairs, Mandeville arrives from India, being unable to bear any longer a Reparation from his daughter, having rece.vcd no accounts of her, or X x	acknow-

acknowledgment of the remittances he had made for her maintenance. As foot) as he arrives, he is recogniled by Realize, Steward of the Mandeville property, who immediately makes a demand upon him for money, and thieatens an arreft upon non payment. Sir Solomon Cynic, att old telly batchelor, being ignorant that Mandeville had fent home money for the fupport of his daughter, alfo determines to aiTflt Mandeville for a fuin for which he had made himfelf refponfible as fe-eurity for a deceafed friend. In this extremity Mandtville, debarred from the fight of his daughter, and unable to liquidate thefe demands, is almolt ftantic with grief and defpair, but is aflifted by the generolity of George Howard, who procures him an afytum in a neighbouring cottage. The tenant of this cottage, old Ruftic, had been di (charged from his fitu-ation as game-keeper to the Mandeville ellate, on fufpicion of being a poacher ; and, with his daughter, had been Iblcly indebted for fupport to G. Mandeviile, Sir S. Cynic, though profelfedly an epemy to the conjugal ftate, is not without a fpirit of gallantry, and, therefore, when the daughter of Old Rultic applies to him in behalf of her father, he becomes enamoured, and vifits her iecivtly at the cottage.—While he is in the midft of his amorous avowals, MandevUle* accompanied by Howard, returns to the cottage, and Sir Solomon, to efcape ob-l'ervation, hide3 hitnfelf among lomc draw in a recefs, before which a curtain is drawn, butfo ill (¿cured that Dolly Rultic js obliged to fallen it up with Sir Solomon’s cane-fword. To divide Howard and Albina, the Villainous G over nets bad induced the latter to believe, that Howard vifited th' cottage from motives of regard to Ruftic’s daughter. To alcertain this fail, Albina aliumes a naval uniform, pretending to be a Mr. Herbert, her own coufm. Having traced Howard to the cottage, Albina will not ftir from it till Ihe has feen him. He therefore appears, and conceiving her to be an impevtintnt fwaggering boy, a quart el aiifes ; and a* Albina tin eatcus to wound him with her fword, he feizes the cane-fword which fupporteJ the curtain, and hence Sir Solomon is difeovered. As Mandeville had thus been alfo difeovered in his retreat, he therefore, according to the advice of Howard, endeavours to Ihelter himfelf in an apartment of Mandeville Caltle, which was fnppoai.il to be haunted. T>* this apartment Albina is ordered by her Governels, as a place of feevriry and punilli-

ment, till the marriage lhall have taken place between tbe former and Veritas. Albina is not the lead diihirbed by the fttppofed horrors of the place 5 but perceiving that Deborah, tbe old maid, who had been lla ioned with her as a guard, is very much terrified, Albina impofes on her fears, in order to get rid of her ; and, according to the ftyle of modern Novels, tells her that the old Baron, laid to have been murdered in that room, would appear when the bell ftruck on*. Precifely at this period, Mandeville, who had been purfutdby Bailiffs, fires a piftol in tbe air to frighten them, and then breaks into the haunted room. Deborah flies away in horror, and Albina, terrified, conceals herlelf behind the bed-curtain. In this fituation (lie is fern by Mandeville, who, as (he (fill reta ns her naval uniform, takes her for one of his enemies, and treats her roughly; but finding (he fyinpathifes in his griefs, he trulls to her proteffion, without, however, revealing who he is, though earnetlly defired to uifclofe himfelf. In this fituation he is found by Realize and the fervants, who feize him : but Albina dicves them away with the piltol, which they fuppofe (• be loaded j and by her delire Msndeville retires to another apartment, where Ihe locks him in to prevent deteftion. She then refumes her female attire, and is on the eve of being hurried away from the Caftle by the Govcrnefs, who is appreherffive that Ihe will fee her father, lavilh her fortune upon him, and conlequently that Hie fliall lofe all htr authority. Veritas, who is a well difpofed man, though he had been drawn into the fchemes of the Govrrnefs, having been made drunk by Howard, re« veals the whole phrs of tbe intended mauiage, expoles the interelled villainy of the Governels, and produces a letter, in which her artful fopprefilon of the remittances from Mandevilie, and the fubtle means which Ihe had ufed to induce his father to difinherit him, are all unravelled. This dilcovery induces Sir Solomon to take part with Mandeville, and to overthrow the power of the Governed. AL-biua, lcnliM* ut the impofuions that had been praililed on her and her grandfather, in an interview with Howard, tears her grandfather’s wiU to pieces, aliedging, that her far her would have been the legal heir if his characfcr and conduit had not been milreprtlented. Alter this general explanation, Atbir.a and Howard are of courle given to each othei, and juitice is difpcnled to all parties.
Such is the plot of this Comedy, in

which the Author has combined both fentiment and humour; though not without lomt of thofe farcical-fituations which are to he found in all his Comedies. The incident of the difeovery appears to have been fuggefted by that of Square in “ Tom Jones," and the drunker) communication feems to have been borrowed from Foote’s “ Lame Lover." It was received with great applaufe, and tbe per-foitners defetved the approbation they met with.
The following Prologue and Epilogue, the former written by Mr. Taylor, and the Utter by M. P. Andrews, F.lq. were fpoken by Mr. R. Palmer and Mrs. Joidan :
PROLOGUE.
NO new offender ventures here to-night: Our prcf.i« Culprit is a well-ki.o.in wight, Who, finer his errors with fuch eafe obtain A pardon, has prefum’d to fin again.
We own lus faults ; but, ere the caufe proceed,
Something in mitigation let u> plead.
If he was found on Fashion’s broad highway,
There Vicz and Folly were his onlyprey; Nor had he in his perilous career E’er put a Angle pafirnger in fear;

And the ralh youth expos'd himfelf alone.
Let us the objects lie attack’d revit w— Unhurt they all their wonted courfe purfue.

Or, more to dignify fuperior life,
Cheat their heil friend of money and of wife.
If fucli the age, in vain may Satire toil,

As feme may wonder why our Author's found

The Ample truth at cnce we fairly own—
His fubtleft toils were in that covert known; The bufhes he had beaten o’er and o’er For Come new quarry, but could ftart no more:
Hence he refolv’d a vain purfuit to yield,
And ablet fpurtfinen left to range the field. Befides, fo many lenient trials part,
Well might he fear to fuffer there at Jail.
At length to this dread Court he trulls his fate,
Where mighty Critics fit in fo'emn ftate:
But, fure that Candour will aiUrt her claim, He fcorns to fculk beneath a borrow'd name 1 And fince no bad intention fway’d his mind, Whate’er the deed, it rand indulgence find; Nor fhauld a rigid fentence drive him hence, For hire, at leaft, it is his fiffl offence,

was written by Mr. Jofeph Reed, de, ceafed, and was fir If afted for the benefit ' o£Mr. Holland, in 1767, and two nights afterwards; when, a differenee taking place between the Author and Manager, the Tragedy (though approved of) was laid afide. On the prefent occalion, the parrs of .¿Eneas, Narbal, Jarbas, and Dido, originally performed by Mellrs. Powell, Holland, Benfley, and Mrs. Yates, were reprtfented by MelTVs. Barry, more, Palmer, Caulfield, and Mrs. Sid. dons. Candour requires us to fay, that this Piece is not unworthy ct repre-fentation; the dory, though hackneyed and familiar, is not improper for the ftage, and the chai afters are ably diferi. minated, the language fufficiently dilfant from familiarity or bomba If, and the iitu-ations interefting. It was, as on its ori. ginal performance, received with ap-plaule.
After the Play, Mr. Colman’s Tales, with the title of “ My Night-cap and Slippers,” were recited and fung j but the reception of the fecond Tale was by no means gratifying to the lpcaker Mr, Palmer.

" Drury Lane, for the benefit ot Mrs. Siddons. In this P!ay Mr. Kemble and Mrs. Siddons gave energy and effect to the powerful appeals to the paflions in the chat ailers of Old Wilmot and his Wife. At the cortclufion of the evening's entertainment, Mrs. Siddons Ipoke the following Lines, fad to be written by Mrs. Piorri:
AND now, this idle airy frolic part,
Comes our fate Idler't her nr if the lift j Tlio’ for a month, a feafon, or a year,
Each parting moment ftill is found fcvere ; Whilrt hollow murmurs ring from Pole to Pole,	.
And black'ning clouds round frighted Europe
. roil.
One’s boding heart fears thunder, fire, and rain,	,
May part us all, ere we fhall meet a»ain.
Nor need we turn to public care our eyes, The Stage too teems with true calamities ; Scarce has it ceas’d, mettunks, the foltmn knell,
,	Since long tried merit took her laft farewell ;
Her warning fpirit fpeaks from underneath. That mimic woes mult end in ceru.n deaths ¿r\.- .	. • Yet,'to ant.cipate fuch ills—not nigh,
Were but a fatal atrujiry.
.	Our Comic Mufe too, fcgtittr topics lendings
Proves that in marriage was her nat'ralcnd-*	'	mg ;
Whillt, grateful for thofe fmiles which made us gay,
Each kindtft wilh waits on her fVcddirg Day j And fure, fuch uler.ts, honours, ¡har d be‘	tween ’em,
If ’Lis rot happy, to!y the Deuce is in ’em.
My own fhort abfence, howfoe’er employ'd,
. Tat from your fmiles mult feel an aching void 4

•pHE LAST OF THE FAMILY, a A Comedy,_ by Mr. Cumberland, was ailed the fir(t time at Drury Lane, for the benefit of Mr. Bannilter, inn.
Sir John Manfred has an only daughter, benefit to his large property, whom, from a ftrong tinilure’of family pride, he is re. folved to mari’v to no" man who wall not take his own name. But this ftrojeft ¡s fr u lira ted by the predileilion of the young Lady to Peiegrine, a namekfis youth, who has been employed by Sir John to write the hiftory of his family. The perfon yhom Sir John had fixed upon for hit fon-in law was Abel Ap- Origin, fon to Sir Abraham Ap-Origm, a Welch Baronet, whoj having as much family pride Rs his neighbour, ufufes to let his heir • lofe his name to gain a wife. A* foon as Lftitia Manfred's palfion for Peregrine is known to her parents, he is difmified from the family; when the young Lady, in order to regain her lover, feigns mad. Peis, and a ¡cues of circum/fances enfue, which terminate in the difeovery that Peregrine is the orphan Ion of a brother to Sir John Manfred, who then gives him his daughter.
This Comedy is fraught with more whim and humour than generally falls to the lot of its Author’s dramatic writings, jliat the Author offers h s Work to the J’ubhck rot without apprehenfion ; though we th.nk he may dilinifs his fears, and confidently demand approbat on from the fucctfs of his attempt. The principal eharaffers of this Work are three brotliers, of different difpcfitlons, purfuits, and manners; all amiable in general, though not wholly fault lefs. The incidents anfe naturally, and lucceed one another without any violence or MiptoSabilny. In the progrefs of the flory, the mind is kept in fufpence, and the events are r anticipated before their time. The l.t* y d.fcufiions do not interrupt the chain of adventures bu appear naturally to arife out of them. There is a due m.xture pf the comic with the ferious, and we confider the
