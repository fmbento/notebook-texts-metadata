, ITALIAN OPERA AT DRURY-LANJt.
/ ^ 2./ —------------^---------
The programme issued by the lesseo of Drury-Iano The* atro for his second season of Italian opera is of too varied and attractive a character not to warrant a fow preliminary remarks. As it is now pretty sure that Her Majesty’g Theatre will not be open to the public this year—at all events, not under the direction of Mr. Lumley—some of the most noted singers of the day have been thrown on the market, from among whom it must be generally alio wed( Mademoiselle Picco, lomini being on the opposite shores of the Atlantic) Mr. E. T. Smith has selected the two very best,—viz.»Mademoiselle Tietjens (or Titien.0), the dramatic soprano, and Signor Giuglinl, the tenor. Add to these Signor Graziani, the favourite barytone, from the Royal Italian Opera, Covent, garden, whose obligations to the establishment under notice havo been ratified in a letter signed by himself (which has gone the round of the papers), and Signor Badiali, the bass, who produced last season so good an impression in every part he essayed, with the single exception of Don Giovanni, and we have already a tolerably strong quartet of principals—two of them, Mademoiselle Tietjens and Signor Badiali, being as capable in a histrionic as in a vocal sense. But, thus much disposed of, more remains to tell. The cry for “ novelty/* to which Mr. Burnley was always zealously responding, and with more or less success, has been answered by Mr. É. T. Smith in a voice of thunder. Continental opera-talk has recently dwelt upon the claims of three or four artists,whom oui London amateurs have been for some time longing to hear. That the Drury-lane manager should be inclined to try fortune with one of these, in order to strengthen the chances of his new enterprise, wa3 natural to expect ; but such careful policy seems nob to have formed part of his scheme. Mr. Smith's present view of an operatic company bears a close analogy to what Petronius makes his readers believe was Nero's view of a dinner—not one only, but every conceivable exotic luxury obtainable for money. What frequenter of the Italian Opera has not expressed a wish to hear Mongini?— Elvira Brambilla ? — Enrichetta Weisser ? - Guarducci l Well, in the prospectus of Mr. Smith we find the names ot every one of these artists, combined with others too numerous to mention, and from which we must be satisfied to pick out Madame Giuseppina Lemaire, a contralto of high repute ; Signor Marini, predecessor of Herr Formes at Covent Garden ; Mademoiselle Sarolta, a very young singer, whose début, a few weeks since, at the Italian Opera in Paris, created considerable excitement ; Signor Ludovico Graziani, tenor (brother to the barytone) ; and Mademoiselle Vaneri, who may be remembered as having made a more than ere ditable first appearance as Lucrezia Borgia. About the absolute merits of the new-comers wo are not prepared to say anything. That they are all in a certain sense notorious is, however, beyond a question ; and equally so that, on that account alone, their names must add materially to the attractions. Mr. Smith also announces that “ negotiations are pending with other artists of great cele* brity/'and especially with the well-known contralto, Madame Borghi Mamo ; but “ negotiations pendingn usually stand over until the end of the season, and have, therefore, very little value in the general estimate of an operatic programme. Nor will much account be taken or the sudaen fit of “ classical ” enthusiasm which makes Mr. E. T. Smith so nervously tender about the reputation of Mozart and the necessity of presenting the “ immortal works” of “that great tuneful monter of dramatic song ” in their integrity. A very short trip may conduct the memory back to a certain performance of Don Giovanni at Drury-lane Theatre, in which “ the great tuneful master of dramatic song” was somewhat scurvily treated.
Among the operas to be produced—besides those attempted last year, which it is unnecessary to enumerate— are Signor Verdi’s Macbeth, the same composer’s Vêpres Siciliennes, Guillaume Tell, Martha, La Gazza Ladra, Le Nozze di Figaro, and Gluck’s Arniida. The last-mentioned work. reminds us of that particularly “curious old port” which, at many hotels, is always in the carte and never on the table. The name of “ Gluck” is a bait to the classical amateur which has so often proved deceptive that it is no longer a temptation. Nevertheless, if only one-half of Mr. Smith's pledges are fulfilled, we can readily dispense both with Armida and Madame Borghi Mamo. ^ Tho name of Mr. Benedict as conductor, even without tho printed list of names, is a guarantee that the orchestra will be efficient—a fact which the experience of last season renders, to say the least, consoling. About the ballet the prospectus says little—so little, indeed, that we are at liberty to dismiss

—Sea-ion 1859.—Preliminary Auuouucement.—In announcing to« arr.uigeiaeuw for anotner season, tho Director refers with sincere satisfaction to the unprecedented success which attended hi* individual a.,ci nrst attempt at Italian Opera during the season of 1853. In taking thu opportunity of expressing his thanks to the nobility, gentry, and musical patrons of this national establishment for the nattering encouragement experienced from the numerous audiences who thronged too House fiotu tee first night to the closing farewell, • isplaymg aucli geaujuo interest and hearty appreciation of the talent engaged, has Induced the Director to extend his operations, and to place before thorn, in LLu, approaching season, arti tea of such reputation and ability that cannot ho auruaesed (if equalled) at any other theatre. Great cure has Deuii ocstowed on the formation of the orchestra, which will include e vtfiu ox the first instrumentalists of the day. under the direction of Mr J-h ntdics. l’ho chorus has also been carefully selected, with additions troiu the principal continental opo-a-houses. The bal.'et will be complete in c very respect, comprising artistes of ability and reputation. J.he adaptation of this theatre ior the production of opera3 is palpable, tho building being pronounced by musical connoisseurs to be one of the meet hanuouio as well as one of the best ventilated in Europe. The convenience or tho subscribers and tho public will bo sedulously studied, ad'iitionai private bona and stalls provided, and the theatre entirely rodecorated; iu fact every improvement *hat desire for comfort can suggest wii. be carried out, in order to men t the continued approbation of the supporters, betides the established favourites of last year, the company ru been further strengthened by an accession of new artistes of the highest, order, whose talents are already recognized on various conti-CLutai stages, and who only await the approbation of an English auuieuce to confirm it. By the accompanying list it will be seen that. In a union to the array of talent provided, the celebrated tenor. Mougiui, is engaged , it Is therefore confidently hoped that the organization of every department will realize the great aim of the Director, viz., to provide an Italian Opera of the highest order, worthy of the fiutrouage of the nobility and gentry, subscribers, ¿to., at prices suitable to all. i be present arrangements for the approaching season embrace tlR loiiowmg engagements:—Mdllo Sarolta (a prima donna of distinguished merit, who will make her first appearance early in the Befool McUlo.

DRURY-LANE ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA.—
Season 1859.—The Lesiee and Director having completed his ar-raugements for the approaching season, most respectfully submits the following announcement to the nobility and gentry, hi3 patrons and subscribers. The closing of Her Majesty’s Theatre has enabled Mr. Smith to avail himself of the services of tho unrivalled prima donna Mile. Titieus, and tho renowned tenor Sign >r Giuglini, with several distinguished artistes belonging to that estvblishmcutand. in addition, the engagement of the favourite baritone Signor Graziani, from the i Coveut Garden Italian Opera, also.,che engagement of the celebrated tenor Mongini. During the last five months agents, especially and exclusively engaged for that purpose, have visited every continental city of musical note iu search of first-class lyric and terpsichorean talent. The ensemble which will be presented at Drury-laue during the ensu-iug season will, it is confidently asserted, be superior in point of '* novelty,” and fully e<jual in poiut of ’* talunt ” to that of any opera-houso in Europe. In addition to several new operas which will be given for the first time in England, the magnitude and extent of his engagements will enable the Director to produce Mozart’s works with a coinpleto-nosaaud integrity unrivailed duriug late years in England. Mozart's acoras will be rendered immutilatod. his music will be given unaltered. Indeed, bearing in mind how completely that great tuneful master of dramatic song oas won the hearts of the English public, more than one engagement has been entered into almost solely that his immortal i works should be represented with as perfect an ensemble as is possible. It had originally bot-h iutenñeáíó open ètùîÿ in til£ dÜTJlâÿ month, but the intervention of an unusually late Dent and Passion Week would render more than five or six even demi-roproseutations impracticable before Easter. And in the present year it is absolutely impossible that any London director can secure a full and efficient stall of “fresh voiced” first-class vocal artiatea until their continental winter engagements, which conclude in April, have terminated. The Leasee and Director of the Royal Italian Opera, Drury-lane, has therefore determined to commence his season on the 2óth of April. Great care has been bestowed on the formation of the orchestra, which will include several of the first instrumentalists, under the direction of Mr. Benedict. The chorus has been selected from Her Majesty’s Theatre and the principal continental opera-houses. The ballet will be complete in every respect, comprising artistes of ability ana reputation The convenience of the subscribers and tho public will be sedulously studied ; sofa stalls provided, with ample room between each row. The admission to the urivate boxes and stalls will be at tho graua entrance, In addition to Little Ruasell-street. Extra entrances and exits will be openea. The repertoire consists of the following operas La Favorita, Donizetti • II Trova-ore Verdi ; Linda di Cnamouni, Donizetti ; La Bonnamoma, Bellini ; Era an 1, Verdi ; Lucrezia Borgia. Donizetti ; Don Pasquale. Donizetti ; II Barbiere di Siviglia, Rossini ; Gli Ugonotti Meyerbeer ; Lucia di Latnmermoor, Donizetti ; La Traviata Verdi ’ I Puntani, Bellini , Otello, Rossini ; Don Giovanni, Mozart; Norma, Bellini * Rigoletto, Verdi. Ac.; capable of representation at a few hours notice. In addidon to which, during tho present season, of the .following nine operas, five (at least) wül be produced, viz., Verdi’s grand opera, Macbeth, for the first time in this country , Merendante’» opera, II Giuramento, lately performed with suen éclat at Paris ; Ros-ssini’s Opera, Guglielmo Tell' Flotow’s opera, Martha • Rossini’s opera, La Gazza Ladra, with a powerrul cast * Mozart s ODera, Nozze di Figaro; Gluck’s opera, Armida; Verdi’s opera Lesveores Siciliennes; and. should time permit, Petrella’s now ana Bucce3srui opera of lone; Ossia, L’Ultimo Giorno di Pompe*, with new and extensive scenery and decorations. With suen a repertoire already existing— with works of such magnitude iu contemplation—aod with such an establishment at his command, it only remained for the Director to select a company of vocalists of the highest order, and fie feels assured, that when the enumeration is perused, it will be allowed that tho Royal Italian Opera, Drury-lane, is the only theatre in Emrope-whlch can boast of so distinguished an assemblage of artistes.

SIGNOR ORAZIANI.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,—I have abstained as long as possible from obtruding the question of Signor Graziani’s engagement on the notice of the public. The time, however, has now arrived when I feel that my continued silence might be misconstrued, and I should feel very greatly obliged if you would permit the • ollowing correspondence to be inserted in your paper.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
March 22.	FREDERICK GYE.
“ Royal Italian Opera, Co vent-garden, March 21.
“ Sir,—I see by your advertisements that you continue to announce Signor Graziani. the baritone singer, as being engaged at the Theatre Royal, Drury-lane.
“ The written intimation which I sent you that Signor Graziani was under contract to uie, and the offer which I made you at our recent interview to allow either yourself or your legal adviser to inspect this contract, as well as every document connected with it, ought, I think, to have prevented your repeating the announcement of Signor Graziani’s name.
“ It is my determination, if possible, to prevent the necessity of having recourse to law proceedings, and, with this view, I beg to make the following proposal
“ I propose that your claims to the services of Signor Graziani, as well as my own, shall be submitted to arbitration.
“ I will agree that the arbitrator shall he a Queen’s counsel, to be chosen by yourself.
“ If you object to such an arbitrator, I suggest that we should request any two of the following gentlemen to decide between us viz.,* Mr. C. Kean, of the Princess’s Theatre ; Mr. W. Arnold, proprietor of the Lyceum ; Mr. Buckstone, of the Hay market; or Mr. Webster, of the Adel phi ; which two T will leave to your own choice.
“Should you not’approve of either of the above tribunals, I am quite willing to leave the case to the decision of the gentlemen forming the committee of management of your own theatre.	#	.
“ I beg the favour of an immediate reply, as I conceive it to be most improper that Signor Graziani’s name should day after day appear in the advertisements of both theatres. “ lam, Sir, vour obedient servant.
“E. T. Smith, Esq.” *	“FREDERICK GYE.
“Theatre Royal, Drury-lane, March 22.
“ Sir,—In reply to yours of the 2lst, I beg to say I do not think you ought to feel any surprise at the announcement you complain of, since you well know from Signor Graziani himself that I am warranted in putting forth his name.
“ It is true that on our interview you offered me unrestricted inspection of hi? engagement with you, and which I have no doubt was binding : but he contends, and I think with reason and justice (and, indeed, as I have no doubt the public will), that your default in fulfilling the terms of it released him from the further observance of it. Hence Lis engagement with me.
“ The reference of the matter which it is the object of } our letter to propose, although unobjectionable in point » f personal honour, I cannot accept; for it is not so much a (uestion between you and me as between you and the Signor.	,
“For my own part, hut without the slightest ill-feeling, I beg to say I shall continue the course I have begun, and if you think it your interest to appeal to the law, and so involve the consequent publicity of the grounds which have guided Signor Graziani in his conduct towards me, you must do so, for it is incumbent on me to keep faith with the public. Hitherto I always have, and hope always shall.
“ I am. Sir, your obedient servant,
“ F. Gye, Etq.”	“ E. T. SMITH.
“ Royal Italian Opera, Covent-garden, March 22.
“ Sir,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your reply to my letter of yesterday. Your refusal to submit the case of Signor Graziaui’s engagement to such a tribunal as either of those I proposed to you needs no comment. It is necessary, however, that I should inform you, and, in case you might have been misled, I hereby Rive you notice that I have made no default whatever in fulfilling Signor Graziani’s engagement.
“ As to publicity, I can have no objection to that.
“ I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,
“FREDERICK GYE.
E. T. Smith, Esq.j Theatre Royal, Drury-lane.”
"January, 1859.
“ Not wishing to act towards you in bad faith, I therefore write you the present to inform you that you have broken the contract, and, besides, placed me in a most embarrassing position in consequence of your not having paid me my salary according to our agreement, so that I am-compelled, as I informed you in my last letter, to release myself from every obligation towards you. However, to prevent any miaun. derstandmg, that you may not compromise yourself with the British public by announcing my name in your programme of the season Of the approaching sprirg, 1859, I give you information of the above for your guidance, and at the same time I feel persuaded that you will not now decline paying t© Mr. Brandon, my solicitor, the money due to me, and to whom you will also address yourself in future for any further communication.	" Yours, &c.,	F. GRAZIANI.
“ To Mr. Gye, London.'’
Mr. Gye, when since legally applied to and compelled, has paid the money. Therefore, how he can venture to say in your columns that he had “ made no default whatever in Graziani’s engagement” I cannot imagine.
1 have several letters both of his and Graziani’s, which, no doubt, will come in due time before the public through the medium of a court of justice, if the Covent-garden manager chooses to meet me there.
I told Mr. Gye, and I now again repeat, that Graziani is engaged by me ; his salary is paid in advance, and he will appear at my theatre in the approaching season.
Now, Sir, one last fact. The true reason why I do not choose to submit this matter to any arbitration, or to meet Mr. Gye in any other place than a court of justice, is because his agent availed himself during the late English Opera season of his entree here to lure away my ballet to Co vent-garden, and he tried to do the same thing with my Italian Opera chorus.
Relying on your well-known justice for the insertion of this reply to Mr. Gye’s most unwarrantable attack,
I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient servant,
E. T. SMITH.
fWe cannot allow this correspondence to bo continued, except by advertisement.]
I Advertisement, j
SIGNOR GRAZIANI.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,—T start for Paris in an hour to arrange some important additional engagements, and have little time to reply to Mr. Frederick Gye’s advertisement in your impression of this morning.
Indeed, as he does not question even one of the “facts” contained in my yesterday’s letter to you, replication is almost superfluous.
Nevertheless, I must trouble you with this hurried rejoinder, and rely on your well-known impartiality for giving it the same sort of publicity that you have accorded to Mr. Frederick Gye in to-day’s Times.
Mr. F. Gye complains that I “ omit to state one most important fact.” Why, Sir, if I had stated half the important facts connected with this matter I should certainly have filled two columns of The Times, or rather, you would certainly have declined to insert any of them.
I told one or two salient truths bearing most pointedly on the question. I did not do bo until I was forced into this sort of publicity by your giving your world-wide currency to his attack upon me.
I restricted my reply to about half a column, because I knew that as you had kindly given F. Gye that amount of space for his attack, your unvarying justice would accord me the same space for my reply.
With regard to the alleged new contract which Mr. F. Gye mentions, Graziani only signed it upon the condition that he should immediately be paid the money due on the former one. This condition was broken.
If my “ great object had been to make known to the public” that Gye was in Graziani’s debt, I could and should have given a list of his o wings to other operatic and dramatic artists, compared with which his debt to Graziani is a molehill to a chain of mountains.
No, Sir ; I had no object but to vindicate and defend myself from what, I repeat, was a most unwarrantable attack on my operatic enterprise. ^	,
I fear that the Royal Italian Opera, Drury-lane, is assuming proportions too large for the comfort of Mr. F. Gye.
I say again that my sole reason for refusing to submit to arbitration was the conduct of Mr. F. Gye’s agent in seducing my ballet, and in attempting to seduce my chorus, from this establishment.
I am compelled, after such conduct, to hold Mr. F. Gye at legal arm’s length, and can meet him only in a court of justice.	Sir, your obedient and obliged servant,
E. T. SMITH.

SIGNOR GRAZIANI.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,—Mr. E. T. Smith’s statement in your paper of to-day, if left unnoticed, would give an impression that I am very much in the wrong with regard to Signor Graziani’s engagement.
Mr. E. T. Smith omits to state one most important fact, —namely, that the sum which M. Graziani claimed of me related to his engagement of the last season, and not to that of the next. So little dissatisfied, indeed, was M. Graziani with his four years’ engagement at Covent-garden that in the month of September last he wrote me two most pressing letters concerning its renewal, and the result was that on the 27th of November (this fact is also omitted in Mr. E. T. Smith’s statement) he entered into an entirely new contract with me, binding himself to sing for the seasons 1859, ISliO, and 1861. To prevent misconception, I may add that the payments on account of this engagement do not commence until May next.
Mr. E. T. Smith’s great object appears to have been to make known to the public that I was in M. Graziani’s debt, but the difficulties with which I have had to contend on account of the destruction of the old theatre and in the erection of the new one, are too well known to allow the publication of such a fact to cause me one moment’s uneasiness. I may as well say that the amount due to M. Graziani was for one fortnight’s salary, and that he considered it of so little importance as not even to refer to it in either of the letters which he sent to me concerning his new engagement. At the time, however, when I wrote the letter dated Dec. 15 (and quoted by Mr. E. T. Smith), and in which I requested that this sum should stand over till next season, I had very strong reasons for believing (of which I have documentary proof) that M. Graziani, notwithstanding his new contract, did not intend to fulfil his engagement with me. w Had Mr. E. T. Smith’s statement been a true representation of the case, he would not have refused the arbitration which I proposed to him.
The law proceedings to which I am now driven will place in their proper light some other portions of Mr. E. T. Smith’s statement.
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,
„	,	FREDERICK GYE.
Royal Italian Opera, Covent-garden,
March 25.
SIGNOR GRAZIANI.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,—As Mr. Gye has thought it advisable to insert in your journal an infinitessimal part of the Graziani correspondence, I am compelled, in justice to myself, to ask you to give equal publicity to the following facts
Graziani’s agent first applied to me, stating that he (Signor Graziani) was disengaged, wishing to know if I would engage him, and telling me that Gye had not carried out his engagement with him. I replied, “Yes,” and sent my agent to Paris. He saw Graziani, who told him that in consequence of his not having received his arrears of salary from Gye, after repeated applications for it, he considered his contract broken, and had made up his mind to put an end to it.
My contract with him was then drawn up, and in common justice to Graziani I feel bound to state that, evidently wishing to give Mr. Gye a fair chance of payment, he asked me for six weeks’ further delay before affixing his signature. I consented to this. Eight weeks expired, and I then wrote to know if he was prepared. To this he replied that he would once more write to Mr. Gye, and that this time he would send a registered letter, to make sure of Its delivery. Here is one of Mr. Gye’s answers, which, in justice to Graziani, I feel bound to ask you to insert (sic) :—
“Royal Italian Opera, Coven t-garden, le 15 Dec., 1858.
“ Mon cher Graziani,—Pardonnez-moi que j’ai laissé votre lettre si longtema sans réponse. J'avais l'espérance de vous envoyer quelqu* argent avant ce jour, mais je vois que j'ai tant de choses il payer encore pour la théâtre que cela me serait impossible.
“Je vous demanderai alors s’il vous plait de laisser la somme que je vous doit à la saison prochaine, et en même temps de me pardonner si le vous ai fait souffrir de l’inconvénient.
“ Croyez-moi, mon cher Graziani, votre tout dévoué,
b	“ FREDERICK GYE.”
To this Graziani replied that he was very sorry to say that he could not give any more time for payment, that he really wanted the money, and that the confiding in a previous promise had placed him in a most unpleasant position. At the
oi'i?eibm4)Sr, ?ffiS,^ifie^MlPwasPnol”paiii fie sliould^joctare his contract nullified, in consequence of such non-payment. The end of the year arrived in due course, but he received no reply. My agent then went again to Paris, and Graziani wrote and sent to Gye the following “ registered letter.’’ In justice to M. Graziani I am again compelled to ask you to publish it :—

ITALIAN OPERA. VRUBTLANE.
- —
Mr. E. T. Smith seems bent upon, showing that ail the new singers announced In hh< remarkably attract! .re pro* spectus will be immediately at hand when called apon. Last night three more were introduced, in Donizetti’s serious opera La Favorita —iz,, Mademoiselle Guarducci (from Naples), as Leonora ; Signor Fagotti, as the King ; and Signor Panzoni, as Baldasaaro, the High Priest. \J.l were successful, the lady eminently so ; and fchoir success as shared by Signor Gingiliii, the accomplished tenor from Her Majesty’s Theatre, who never obtained a more enthusiastic reception. Deferring for the moment any critical examination of the merits of the new comers, we muai be satisfied with stating that, after the fall of the curtain, Mademoiselle Guarducci and Signor GiugUm were three times summoned forward ; and that, if wreathes and bouquets were positive insignia of artistic worth, they might be fairly regarded as the greatest dramatic sing *rs Lu existence. Happily they require nothing of the ‘‘Ort to establish their claims to consideration.
./ITALIAN OPERA, DRURY-LANK.
ilp. E. T. Smith inaugurate the Easter holydays last highfc with the first performance of hi» Italian opera company, so long announced, and of which Such great things have <*>en predicated, The interior of the hotl*C> newly .fitted up for the occasion—the pit («is at the Royal Italian Opera) being almost entirely absorbed by stalls, the first tier of seats converted into private boxes, and tho whole cleaned * aud redeoorated—is remarkable for a combination of bril' > iiancy with comfort to which the public had for some time been unaccustomed at Drury Lano Theatre. As might have > been anticipated, there was a very large attendance, the stalls and boxes being filled with an elegantly dressed audience, while the galleriei were crowded with less fashionable . visitors. By the present arrangement for the accom- r modation of those who are able and willing to £ pay 10s. v^d. for places, what now stands for the “ pit" is rendered almost invisible. We believe, however, that it is situated more or lew underneath the dross circle, which, strictly considered, is hardly in consonance with the idea of “ Italian opera for the million,” about which so muoh has l>een said. It frequently happens, however, that *• the million” are talked of in tho beginning and forgotten io the end. The truth is, Mr, ¡Smith’a Italian Opera ' I4 now an enterprise of first-elaas pretensions, and first-c’aas entertainments will be expected, notwithstanding the r »-establishment of the “ old theatrical prices” as the basis of the tariff.
The opera presented last night was Bellini’s Sonnambufa, < and the event of the evening was the first appearance in this country of ai Italian tenor, who, though very yonng, has already obtained a wide celebrity. We allude to Signor Mongini, who undertook the part of Elvino. His opening phrases revealed a voice of 8uch power and rich quality of tone that the audience were thoroughly enchanted ; and the favourable opinion thus instantaneously elicited was strengthened by his passionate delivery of the lo e*duet with Amina (“Ah! vorrei trovar parole”). Nevertheless, as the opera advanced it was easy to perceive that Signor Mongini was not in full command of his resources—that, in short, ho was suffering from indisposition. Occasionally he rallied, and the energy which he evidently possepses carried him through triumphantly. In the finale to the second act— where Elvino, maddened by jealousy and suspicion, rejects the protestation» of the innocent Amina—Signor Mongini reached the highest degree of pathos, and created an extraordinary sensation, the curtain descending amid a genuine burst of enthusiasm. In tho third . act, however, where occurs the famous aii “ Tutto e aci-olto,” with its still more famous pendent, “ Ah ! perche non poseo”—the testing pomfc with every representative of Elvino—the now singer appeared exhausted, and, although he contrived to sustain himself to tho end, it was with the most painful and unremitting exertion. Thus the great vocal situation of the opera produced no effect whatever, under which circumstances, added to the knowledge that j Signor Mongini had been confined to his becl with in- 1 fiuenza, and was only induced to appear at the last moment in order that the public might not be disappointed, we shall refrain from criticism. The impression loft by his performance last night was that he possesses a voice of extended range, great power, and admirable quality throughout, united to a more than ordinary amount of impulse and enthusiasm. Of the rest we may be able to judge more accurately on a future occasion.
Miss Victoire Balfe, the Amina of the evening, was as successful as her warmest well-wisher could have desired. This young lady has improved m every respect. The quasi buskin ess that formerly in a great measure veiled the best notes of her voice seems to have disappeared, and with ad ditional brightness to have left additional strength. Not that Miss Balfe’s voice is by any means powerful; but it ia a legitimate soprano, of great flexibility, even and sweet in tone throughout. Her execution is invariably artistic, and though she evinces a taste for redundant ornament now and then (as, for instance, in the second verse of “ Sovra il sen ;a man mi po$v,”) open to criticism, she is so sure of her embellishments, and \ocomplishcH them with such invariable neatness, that they never sound obtrusive. This was shown in the finale, * “ Ah non giungo,” a brilliant end highly finished performance, the freshness of which brought with it the gratifying conviction that the tamina formerly wanting in Miss Balfe has been attained, together with the other advantages we have enumerated. As an actress our young English prima donna displays remarkable intelligence, animation, and the true dramatic instinct. Her faults—such as are inseparable from youth and inexperience—cannot fail, in one bo indisputably clever and thoughtful, to be speedily eradicated. The audience, pleased with Miss Balfe from the first scene in the opera to the last, applauded her warmly after the cavatina, “ Come per me serono,” and uproariously after the finales to the second and third acts, on each of which occasions she was recalled and presented with bouquets that could have added but little to tho gratification she must have experienced at finding how entirely she had won tho sympathies of her hearers.
Signor Badiali played the Count, and sang “ Ml rawiso” extremely well. The part, however, is not one that suits him. The orchestra, in the rank? of which are many artists from Her Majesty’s Theatre (as also in those of tho chorus) had tho advantage of being directed by Mr. Benedict, whose appearance was hailed with the loudest applause.
After the opera tho National Anthem was performed, and after the anthem a ballet divertissement, in one* scene, entitled Aruidn the music selected from the works of the late Adolphe Adam, the principal dancers being Mademoiselles Boschetti and Morlaochi, from Her Majesty’s Theatre, both of whom were highly successful. This evening Donizetti’s Favorita is to be given, with Mademoiselle Guarducci (from Naples) and Signor Giugiini in tho principal characters.	—.....

//^ ^--------------------------
Two more performances of La Favorita have confirmed the success of Mademoiselle Guarducci, who—-take heij with her faults and with her merits (which latter great).54 preponderate)—is one of the most valuable acquisitions th<3 Italian lyric stage has made for somo years. Mademoiselle! Guarducci has a low mezzo aopraao voice, the tones of whiclf are rich and mellow from the highest note to the lowest^ She sings with, real expression, phrase.3 like one whqr ha* profoundly studied the art of musical declamation, and is wonderfully sparing of superfluous eiaJ bcllishment. These qualities—combined with almost fault-* less intonation, and an earnestness bordering on enthusiasm! —make up a sum of recommendations which, united in ih£ person of one who is evidently young, and, if Neapolitan: journalism id iy be credited,h as been scarcely three years before the public, justify us in watching with interest the futnra careerof their possessor. Donizetti’s Leonora has been cast to so many singers of more or less eminence—from Madame ilosina Stoltz, for whom it was written, to Madame Grisi, its las« and not least distinguished representative—that a novif aspirant is naturally exposed to all sorbs of perilous compariU sons. It is therefore no small achievement on the part Mademoiselle Guarducci to have come forth from such aQ( ordeal triumphantly-tc have wen high praise from con« noisseura in the cavatina, and the hearty approval of her audience in the scene where the las^ sorj rows and contrition of the unhappy “ favourite’’ ara so touchingly portrayed by the dramatist, and iilus^ trated with'uch genuine pathos by the composer. Both aaf an actress and as a singer, Mademoiselle Guvrducci —who lei gifted with an admirable stage-presence—would b# letter for a little more repose. The waut of this is most especially manifest in the last act, which, less carefully and minutely elaborated, would bo just! twice as impressive. Bach night, however, Mademoisella Guarducci has made a sensible advance, and so thoroughly enlisted the sympathies of her hearers that she may possibly accept the .esult as a warrant of perfection, and regard too curious criticism with an eye of compassion rather thdu. o£ deference. Let us hope the contrary, a« much for tha sake of the lady herself as for that of the art of which WQ trust she is destined to be a brilliant ornament.
In Signor Fagotti, who plays the King, and Sfgnoi* Lanzoni (Baldassart), Mr. E. T. Smith has been fortunata —the one being an excellent barytone, tho other a mora than r espectable bass. Signor Giuglini, in some instances, ia singing more finely than ever ; but ho must lie warned in^ time against forcing a voice so agreeable as his when gent-hw treated, and equally against the error of mistaking Toriund&nfsJ gesture an 1 exaggerated emphasis for legitimate liistrioniq effect. "Why, too, when he can sing (and has often snngM ‘ Spirto gentil” to absolute perfection, should he rob it 00 much of tho charm it owes to its innate simplicity, by ox«? cessivo prolongation of note?, ornaments wholly irrelevant^ and such an occasional distortion of die rhythm that it ig scarcely possible for tho orchestra to play the accompany* ment in time ?
Signor Mongini has not yet quite recovered ; but onr Saturday, at tho third representation of Son.at,mbu?<i hltij voice waa so much more under control, and his singing ira ev . ry respect so superior to what it had been or the nighb of his dtbui, as to encourage tho belief that the lavish* praises of the continental press may bo fully borne* out. The performance was in other ’ respects uufortuW nato. Mias Balfe being indisposed, the part of Amin# was undertaken by a lady unknown to tho public, at sof short a notice that the unfavourable criticism she might! otherwise have provoked would be out of place. She did! her utmost.; ana the best ackimwledgmenb we can make for; her devotion (under tho circumstances) is to w ithhold her na me.
Mademoiselle Tietjens has arrived, and is to appear to morrow night in Lucrtda Borgia, with Signor Giuglini ag Geana oa and Mademoiselle Guarduccj as Maffeo OrsmU

| y A ^ITALIAN OPERA, DR UR Y-LA NR,
' Last night the house was crowded in every part, in honottS of the first app -arance at Drury-lanc of Mademoiselle Tiet^ jens (or Titiens), from Her Majesty’s Theatre, the opera being Lucrczia, Borgia. The success of the Viennese “prima donna” was triumphant. It wouid be a faint reflex of the truth to ray tnafc the audience applauded^ whatever she did ; they literally overwhelmed her with thehs demonstrations of satisfaction. Mademoiselle Tietjens iâ now precisely what our musical readers may remember heg last y par in Mr. Lu m ley's establishment—the nearest ap« proaoh to Mademoiselle Sophie Cruvelli that has been wit9 nessed on the operatic hoards. "With a magnificent voice, a fine stage-presence and abundant dramatic energy, she unites other qualities that entitle her to admiration, and aro sure to elicit the sympathies of the crowd. Tha vocalization of Mademoiselle Tietjens Î3 vigo* rous, showy, and brilliant, rather than highly finished ; noi? has she the invariable fluency of her famous Westphalian predecessor, who in chis respect rivalled the most practise# Italian artists on their own domain« Nevertheless, her ex« tended compass of voice, together with the brightness and splendour of the upper tones, enables Mademoiselle Tietjens to venture on tha most daring flights, and, in most instances, with the happiest result. Some of he® passages yesterday evening, In the last movement 08 the cavatina, “ Com’ e bello quale incanto,”were surprising* both for their originality and for the perfect success with which they were accomplished. Then, agafcr^ in the duet where Lucrezia persuades Gennar^ to take the antidote, a passionate earnestness was exhibited wh’ch tools the house “ by storm,” and the curtain descended ami<3 thunders of applause, followed up by a double recalls We d^ not find in M-;derr oiselle Tietjens either the subtle; dramatic perception that has distinguished some of ih$ greatest artists in her especial department, nor the wonder* fill impulse which gives such an abiding charm to thq tragic assumptions of Aladame Grid. The first nay com3 with years, if the last is hardly to he hoped for ; butj Independently of either, there is in all the German singei does a strong evidence of thought, leading to the conclusion that she must bo no less an artist of intellectual than ojî physical powers. That she is destined to win the highest honours at the Drary-lane Italian Opera may be safely conjectured from the genuine enthusiasm she created Iasi night ; and with this, for the present, we must take le&YC} of her.
The opera was, in other respects, strongly cast. moiseHe Guard ucci was admirable as Maffec Orsini, and! obtained a loud encore in the brindisi— although she sanp the romance in ♦'ho first scene, “ Nella fatal Xiimini,^ which was not encored, even better. Signior Giuglir.jj never gave the music of Gennaro more exquisitely. Hi*j *‘ Oi pe^oatoro jgnobilo ” was faultless in style, expresslon^j and execution ; and equally deserving eulogy was the abd interpolated in the last act, a vocal display which, from endl to end, set criticism at defiance. One who can sing to such* perfection should never condescend to questionable means of extorting applause from the undiscrltnluating; and! the strong impression he created on his hearers will no doubt have convinced Signor Giugli.n1 that the worsfl use to which he can put so beautiful a voice as '¿haff with which nature has endowed him is to force if-j and that the most equivocal compliment he can pa$ himself, as a true artist, is to depart from thosq canons of tasto which make art respectable and respected^ j He has no need to shout and strain, when be can sing I as he sang last night.	Signor Badiali was the DuJiSjj
and. in a musical	sense, his performance tvag
remarkably good. The orchestra was directed on thlfl occasion by lignai ¿Vrditi, the clever and Industrious com eluefcor who succeeded Signor Bonetti at Her Majesty1# Theatre, and the whole performance was such a légitimât» success that the hollow farce of The Uouqueis, performwd I after each successive fall of the curtain, was altogf. thefi what the new allies of Jiussia term ‘ d*. trop,’*

n ITALIAN OPERA, DRURY-LANE.
The new tenor, Signor Moxtgini, is gradually convalescing,, and the increased effect he produces on each successive ap. pt arance only tends to show how ill-advised it was to allow him to struggle against insuperable obstacles on the first night of the season. In Lu^L i <li Lammcrnwor the extra* ordinary power and line quality of his voice were frequently . »manifested. The sensation ho created in the *• Mu led iz.ionesb and still more in the l* Fra poco,” justified the hope that, when he is entirely master of his resources, he will fully vindicate the reputation ho enjoys abroad. That, never th'less, Signor Mongini is a singer of force rather than delicacy, and relies for his effects upon sudden hursts of energy rather than upon tin? graces and refinements of his art, may he safely predicted. Beyond this we do not feel warranted in offering an .»pinion. The Lucia of Miss B&lfe gives as strong evidence of inr provement as her Amina. There are some touches--especially in the mad scene—more exquisite than anything we noticed in. the Sunfio-mlala} and amid the v.ne exuberance of ornament is remarked the same artistic finish of execution. Miss Balfe—to judge by the hearty applause with which her erf. rrs are rewarded—is already well established in public favour. She must be gently admonished, however, not to forget, in her gratitude for the sympathy evinced to wards herself, the dramatic exigencies of the part she in in»personating—not, for example, to acknowledge applause in the midst of such a scene as that to which allusion has been made, the interest ' of which is inevitably neutralized by any incident that helps to disturb the illusion and to remind the audience that Mias Balfe, not the veritable Lucy of Lammermoor, is before them.
Three performances of Luerczia Borgia have confirmed, the success of Mademoiselle Tietjens. At the b.-t, on »Saturday night, Mademoiselle Guarducoi being Indisposed-the character of Maffeo Orsini was sustained by another new singer— Madame Lemaire—with credit, both to herself and the establishment. The audience received her with great favour, and especially applauded her in the popular brindiii,<l 11 segreto per esser felice.”

! ^ ITALIAN' OPERA, DRURY-LANE
Mademoiselle Saroita—who made her first appearance last night as Violetta, in the Truvuita, was received with flattering indulgence, encored In more than one piece, and recalled after every act—is so evidently a beginner that it would be harsh to expose her to the ordeal of severe criticism* To sum up, in a line Mademoiselle Sarolfca’s shortcomings at the present stage of her career—she has a vast deal more to learn, as far as the vocal art is concerned, than she has hitherto acquired ; how, for ex* ample, to ptodu.ce and how to sustain the tones ; how to execute scales, ascending and descending ; how, in short, to vocalize. Nevertheless, she has sensibility of no common order, which whoit study shall have rendered her a more practised mistress of her resources may be put to excellent account. This was shown in all the pathetic passages of Violetta’s music, and nowhere more decidedly than in the duet with the elder Germent ( A.ot II), when the unhappy courtesan Is in dneed to resign her lover. Here, too, and elsewhere, the dramatic instinct was revealed xn so many ways, and with such earnest forgetfulness of herself in her part, as to encourage the oonvicfcion that Mademoiselle Saroita is destined to become an actress. For one so very young her stage bearing is remarkably ea3y and graceful ; and this, combined with an extremely prepossessing appearance, invest* all she does with a certain charm, which, perhaps, too frequently induces her hearers to overlook —at times even to applaud- her faults. Enough has been said, however, to make onr musical readers understand that there is something to look forward to with Interest in Mademoiselle Saroita, whose voice is a sweet and legitimate, if not powerful, toprano, and who, if she is at heart an artist, has it in her power, or we are greatly deceived, to become oue in reality. From a girl of 20 neither vocal nor histrionic perfection is expected; all we have a right to claim is zeal, perseverance, and the resolute will to advance. Whether these are elements In the nature of the débutante it is for herself to prove.
Another new comer—Signor Ludovico Graziani (brother of the fiercely contested barytone)—played Alfredo, with a voice not particularly captivating in quality, and a style of singing ranging between the boisterous and what French musicians term the “ larmoyantThe duet with Violetta, in the first act (we do not mean the Brindisi, which was encored), was probably never taken so slowly or snng with less effect. The air in the second act was to match ; but Signor Grazianl in some measure redeemed himself in the popular duet with Violetta
n>r «r»	-----,n ±V-—_------
more irreproachably given by Mademoiselle Saroita than anything else that fell to her share. The demand for a repetition was unanimous. Signor Badiali (Germont, sen.), in the sentimental romance,tf Di provenz’ il mar,” achieved the accustomed sucoess. The house was well attended, and the applause, if nob invariably discriminating, was of the heartiest description.

A
ITALIAN OPERA: DRURY-LANE.
The vogue of MdHe. Tletjens by no mearyi diminishes On the contrary- tho a..*ong imprcoeion she created in I>dni-aetfci*s Lucrczia P,o^ria has been renewed in-Signor Verdi’a Trovatorc, which was given for tbe second time last night to a very crowded bsixso, and received with the highest favour from beginning to end.
With the peculiar merits that distinguish the Leol nora of the Yiennese “ prima donna” otrr musica -readers were made acquainted last season, when the Trovn m lore, with Mademoiselle Tietjens a > the heroine, was fre fluently presented at Her Majesty’s Theatre. If the patron i; of Mr. Lurrdey were liberal in their applause, the** of Mr. £. T. Smith are enthusiastic. FTom tho cavatina in the first act to the duet in „n. st —where Leonora dies before her lover, from. the effe. of the poison 3he has swallowed in order to- baffle his riv; .1, every striking dramatic point, every brilliant trait of vocalization, m laid hold of as a prete st to render homage to tho favourite of the hour. At the same time the fine qualities which elicited admiration at fcho aristocratic estar blishment in the Hay market aro just a? conspicuous in the Hmry-lane performance. Mademoiselle Tietjens- dees not sing “ to the gallery” (like some who could be named), but, with artistic conscientiousness, to the entire audience . and yet the occupants of the gallery applaud her just as heartily as if she were exerting herself for their exclusive gratification. Those glorious nigh notes, indeed, are irresistible , and not merely the unfcralned amateur, but the most critical of connoisseurs is induced to overlook botkfaiut3 of style and faults of execution (Mademoiselle Tiebens is not immaculate), while their piercing andeonorous^ccents are vibrating through the nouse. Although^ as a whole, we much prefer her Lucrezia. it must be admitted that the Leonora of Mademoiselle Tiefcjpns L marked no less by genuine excellence than by the exhibition of splendid physical resources, and that the union and blending of the two is calculated to impress the majority quite as vividly as even a jsore thoroughly finished and irreproachable display. The Manrioo of Signor Giuglini remains precisely what it wa*, id) Her Maijesiy’S' Theatre, revealing tho same beauties and the same defects.. Nothing can surpass tlte perfection of his delivery in the slow movement, “ Ah si ben iuio,> (Aot III.), the serenade behind the scene.., ( Act I.), ami the cant/fOile from the tower In the i( Miserere/* while—to pass from unre^uved praise to qualified ceaeure—hi some of the best parts of the opera by dragging, the time, by needlessly dwelling vqx>n notes is themselves unimportant, and by injudicious endeavours to make hia naturally soft ana beautiful voice pass for a i£ tenore robwito,” .as in ~£ Hi quella pira, Act III. ,aud other passages demanding an anioun-of physical force that be does noLa&d novel'can posssea—pas sages which, nevertheless (take Signor Mario for an example) y might be .,lad© just as elective, and far more pleasing-through other means. The Azucena of Madoiueiselle Guaruucei, judged simply as a vocal effort, is in comparably the be^t we can recall, with, one exception—that Madame Alboni. Made moiselle Guarducci’s voice» exquisite throughout its register, is rather a TMtzn. .yopt'-ano than a contralto, but her execution is so well balanced, «id so generally faultless that this is scarcely *ver felt as a draw* back. As a histrionic embodiment the Gipsy of; Mademoiselle Guarducci neither emulates tbe passionate vehemence of Madame Taulme YDrdot nor the studied- energy of "Madam© Nantier I>idice; but it realiaes something between, these and the q/ua*>i placidity of Madam© Alboni, and in more than one instance ie preferable to any of the throe. Intelligence and time sensibility are visible from one end to the othe r of Mademoiselle Guar -ducci’s performance, eliciting approval with equal reason iuj the dark disclosure of Azucena’s wrongs and in the evh«-deuces of attachment which, despite her -worse xaiore ^ she eve* ‘and anon, betrays for the hapless youth who believes her to be his mother. Gignor Badiali, as- Count di Luna, shows the same ability, earnastness, and zeal that mark the impersonation of almost every character ha undertakes.
The audience last night was not only numerous, but iu a mood to be nlcasod, “ qv-ar.<: nCm-c and so honours were unsparingly lavished on Mademoiselle Tietjena. and Signor Cinglini, in the shape of encores and recalls, of which it i,-> unnecessary to give a detailed account, inasirjaeli as they were uniformly administered in the places to which have been aceustorr^d ever since the avenging Gipsy first shrieked the history of her wrongs in the ear of a confiding ar.<I-syinpathi/iing British public. Enough th;w the Proimorc-is as great and decided a success for Mademoiselle- Tiefcjenr, as LUfCrezia tfo<
Since we last ailudect jo the Italian Opera at Dmry-lan either© have been two performances of ftignor-VercLFS Rivulet to, but m both instances with equivocal results, ewii\£ to t>he nervousrviiss or the inefficiency 'whichever r#ord may be-found moat appropriated ot th>- ladies a> wh-iitt tho iqar-i of Giidawue infcriibted Both were ‘ fir^t appearances,” and both, therefore, in a measure entitled to indu)gpnco; W© fear, however, that with regard tc Msrdemojfcello Enrichetta.

ITALIAN OPERA, DR UR "S-LANE*
Don Giovanni was produced last night, and the performance, though iii many respects open to criticism, was in some instances remarkable. The Donna Anna of Mademoiselle Tietjens is one of the finest assumptions of that highly intelligent and popular artist. In this she won more laurels at Her Majesty’:? Theatre than in any other character ; for, although, the music is instinct with the Italian element of beauty, it is, after all, German in the abstract, and thus comes home tvith. better grace to the German singer than the majority of parts belonging essentially to the Italian school, M&denioselle Tietjens has rarely appeared to more striding advantage than last night. Her execution of the magnificent recitative and air in which Doma Anna recounts to her lover the history of Don Giovanni’s perfidy w-m worthy of the dramatic situation and worthy of the music. No wonder that the audienco—one of the most densely crowded of the season— should have been moved to enthusiasm by so grand and passionato a display. Equally striking was the duet with Ottavio, ‘L Fuggi crudele,’ attor the murder of the Commandant (in tho first scene of the opera) ; and the air, “ Non mi dir,” with which Donna Anna makes her final exit. After this last Mademoiselle Tieijena wa3 not merely recalled, but encored. Her warmest admirers, nevertheless. could hardly have felt otherwise than surprised at the equivocal taste which induced the clever lady to recommence in tho middle of the quick movement—just at that point where the bravura flourishes are introduced, and in which the spirit of Mozam isleest of all manifest. If the movement; wa.1-, too long to sing twice through so late in the evening, why repeat any portion of it ? Mademoiselle Tiet-jens would have exhibited more discretion and more respect for the compoeer had she remained satisfied with her.first. success, and declinedacoeding to the exorbitant demands of her adw'ha-rs. Thievery unclassical proceeding was oom-inantod *.-n moto than once I as5 season,, with what effect maybe gathered from the foregoing. '
.Signor Cingimi \Don Ottavio) &’'& not	more in-
clined than his Teutonici partner to listen to plain-spoken counsel.' The irreproachable perfection of ids “ Dalia su» pace” warranted tne anticipation of similar excellence in^ “ H mio tesoro;” but alas! the disappointment as* great __ dr; ~*Bad been- the expectation- Though some phrases 'were smoothly delivered, the manner in which tho florid passages were defaced—by alterations absurd in themselves as well as out of keeping with the context—merited nothing less than unqualified censure. Signor Giuglinl may possibly have fortified himself with the assurance that whofcher he sang well or ill, displayed good or bad taste, he was sure of an encore, and bo proceeded to handle Mozart after the fashion complained 1 of, making this divine melody at the best a convenience, if not abboluteiy a pretext, for claptrap. His version of ‘‘11 mio tesoro” might appropriately find a place in the Don Giovanni of Signor Alary.
The Zeriina was Miss Balfe, whose acting was graceful, natural, and prepossessing, but scarcely spirited enough.
| The same criticism applies to her singing, which, though invariably correct and finished in a ¿'.rely musical sense, was in many instances comparatively tame. In no other way can we account for such incomparable pieoe» (and universal favourites) as the duet, “ La cl darum,” and the airs, “Batti batti” and “ Vedrai itesftlio,” Jpa&irqg off with so little applause. Oui accomplished #oung countrywoman must reconsider her Zeriina, for which one would imagine nature had precisely cut her out. Bet her sing all the music with as much point and vigour as the second part of “Batti batti,” and there will be little room for animadversion. Miss Balfe should bear in mind that Zerlina, though a peasant, is thoroughly imbued with the tender sentiment, and quite as passionate as she is capricious. Mozart has decided this even more immistakeably than Da Ponte.
What shall ho said of the rest*.? Of Mademoiselle Van ori
( who appeared Iasi, season, with soraq credit, as Lucrezia Borgiaj in Donizetti’s opera) we have principally to record that she obtained a vani deal of applause and not a few	bouquets.	At present—while her
voice is of excellent quaJifcy, anu sufficiently powerful in the upper tones—she has not, with all her oarnesfc-! ness and good intentions, experience enough for the musio of Donna Elvira. Wc owe her thanks^ however, for restoring ac air which is almost invariably left out, although ite omission renders the character of Don Giovanni’s abandoned, but still doting miotress, even more mysterious and unintelligible than as originally sketched by Mozart’s vivacious 15terary coadju tor/ With respect to restorations, by thi: way, Mr.
E. T. Smith has emulated the classical example so magnanimously set by the director of Her Majesty's Theatre some ime r tnce j nay, the Drury-lan.. manager has even surpassed Mr. Lumley In this particular, for not only has “Dalia sup. pace'5 been replaced in the month of Don Ottavio, Donna Elvira been allowed to explain herself more succinctly through the medium of the air just alluded to, and Masetto (Signor Castelli; permitted to express his jealous fears in tho deliciously rustic song, “ Ho capito,” but in the ball scene the well-known minuet is followed by another dance, which while undoubtedly tho composition of Mozart, is not ( co bo found in any part of the score of Mozart’s Don Giovanni.
The character of the brilliant, gay, and profligate nobleman—hero of the “ opera of operas,” most fascinating: and consummately developed of lyric personages—was embodied, .After the same manner as last year, by Signor Badiali, a veteran entitled to the highest consi<L ration, but to accept whom for the “Don Giovanni” of Da Ponte and Mozart would demand a violent stretch of imagination even from the most uninitiated playgoer. B sporcalo was im person eteri by Signor Marini, whose splendid bass voice used to be extolled, and with good reason, in the early days of che Royal Italian Opera (Govent garden), and whose peregrinations in various parta of tne globe have not by any mean* mace him a worse singer. Besides tho moores we have mentioned, the short and emphatic chorus in the finale to act 1, Viva la» libertà,” was loudly redemanded. Mr. Benedict presided in. the orchestra, which may account in a great moasur© for tho effective manner in w hich the accompaniments were played and many of tho concerted pieces executed. No opera requires a practised musician to conduct it moro urgently than Don Ciwiauni.

ITALIAN OVERA, DRU It Y-LA NE.

Tor the first time since her London engagement Mademoiselle Uuardacci has bad an opportunity of displaying her accomplish-nenta in the florid style—and this in one of the operas of Rossini, the greatest, and most legitimate master of t'he florid school- last night she appeared as Ro*\ca, in ^he Barbicre di Sivigfia, and by her execution of the music, no less than by her delineation of the character, raised he; • se’f •*. step higher in publie estimation. That Mademoiselle Guardncci became the Spanish costume well may readily be believed ; but she had previously enjoyed no occasion of demonstrating that her powers as an . actress 1n refined comedy were on a pai with her I natural gifts and artistic acquirements as a vocalist. The part of Kosina having been originally intended for a mezzo soprano is precisely suited for the voice of the new singer ;
I and it was gratifying to find that she had mastered it so 1 completely as to bo entitled to unqualified commendation.
I The famous cavatina,	“ Una voce	poeo fa,'*	and the
l equally famous	duet	with Figaro,	** Dtrnque	lo son,”
were sung to perfection. In the lesson ¡-wae Mademoiselle Guarducci introduced the ai»-, 41 Ah s’estinto,” from Mercadante’s Donna Caritca, which she gave with such combined grace i*nd brilliancy &a to elicit a general encore. Not to enter farther into the merits of her Rosina,	we	may venture to state	that in
very many respects it approaches more nearly to the Rosin» of Alboni	than anything that has
been heard on	the	Italian stage	since that incom-
parable mistress of the genuine Italian school was first made known to the London public. Without possessing the de^p and full-toned contralto tone1? of Alboni, the voice of Mademoiselle Guarducci is remarkable for the same delightful mellowness, the same evenness throughout its register, the same sweetness of quality, and. ad but the same fluency. Mademoiselle Guard zicci is young, however, and the fluency which already exists in. an eminent degree can hardly fail to be attained in the desired perfection, with further practice and experience. Take it for all in all, a more satisfactory performance than her Resina has not been witnessed for years. So good was it, indeed, as almost to encourage tho hope that the art of sirring is not just yet—as many good judges are inclined to believe— on the point of dying out. At present these few observations must st-fli ce ; together with the bare statement that Signor Mongi i acted the part of Count Alznaviva with remarkable spirit, an^ in his execution of th. music proved that his magnificent voice if properly cultivated, ought to be flexible as weil as powerful, that Signor Badiail was Figaro Signor Marini, Bartolo -, and Signor Lanzonl, Basilic. We shall return the Barbiere, which in mon instances than, one is fairly entitled to consiaeratiou.

To-morrow, (Friday,) IT G1URAHE1TO.
ITALIAN OPERA, JJRURY-LAKE.
A few line* must suffice at present to record the corr ■success of the Hugucn >ts, which was produced last night in a style altogether creditable to the establishment. Nothing, indeed, that has been brought out since the institution of Italian Oper- at Drury-lar.e has afforded more unequivocal satisfaction. Every one engaged In the performance appeared anxious to do justice to Meyerbeer's magnificent music, and thG combination that resulted was for the most partin the highest degree efficient. Even the choruses and concerted pieces, which are frequently open to criticism at this theatre, were given with a spirit and decision that, except in one or two instances, entitled them to unqualified praise. As favourable examples may be cited, the “ PatapJan,” which we have rarely heard better sung, the “ Benediction of the Swords and the septet in the duel scene at the jPrd nix C’ercs, in which Signor Giuglini declaimed the principal tenor part with extraordinary energy and force. Aii these were received with marked approval afid the septet (without consideration for Signor Giuglini) was unanimously redemanded. To Signor Giugimi’s Raoul do Nangis no further allusion need be made, the merits and defects of his performance (the former of which, be it under stood, greatly preponderate)havingbeun rept\*fcedl> set forth. Wu may add. ho wove r, that he lias seldom appeared to greater advantage: and that if in the great duet with Valentino —the culminating incident of the opera- -he would exert hiuiself audit half as much, and strive to realize a perfect whole, rather than a series of telling “ points,” he might create twice the impression, and be stiU better entitled to the good opinion of connoisseurs.
The Valentine of Mademoiselle Tietjenswaa the most brilliant feature of the evening. In this part she made her deb (It, last year, at Her Majesty's Theatre, with a success that was incontestable ; and, after frequent repetition - in the course of the season, a general conviction prevailed that it was one of her best assumptions, if not, indeed, her very best. The interval that has elapsed would seem to have Been well employed, for whereas the "Valentine of ,'v>3 was remarkable for a great many line points, the Valentine of 18.M) almost renders the task of criticism super-Hiious. There was, in short. little in the performance of Mademoiselle Tietjens last night that called for an} thing less than unqualified praise. Artistic throughout, in some of the mere prominent situations it was absolutely splendid. Nothi *ig could Hurj ass the duet in which the unhappy Valentine reveals hersAi to V.arcd. It wasnotmerely the wonderful brightness and resonance of her upper tones, nor the much and justly vaunted trait in Which ahe gives out with such ease and sustains with ^ each strength and clearness the C in
aUY1—foliowhi'r it up by a descending scale that1 trebles tl:c difficulty— which challenged admiration, but the conception and execution of the entire scene. Nearly, if not quite, as striking was the duet with Raoul, already mentioned—wMch, on the part oi Mademoiselle Tiefcjen?, was replete with beauties, vocal and histrionic, Not, how* ever, to go further into details, this was the greatest triumph she has yet achieved before the London public, and the enthusiasm of tho audience was commensurate with the merits of the artist.
A paragraph must suffice for the root. The Marcel of Signor Marini has much to recommend it, although, in a vocal set*, e, rather’ to be eulogized for vigour than refinement. Signor Kagptti is, in many respect*, ibo best Nevers that has been seen on the London boards ; while, on the other hand, tho St. Bris of Signor Lauzoni is coarse and somewhat obtrusive. The distribution of parts should, with reference to these gentlemen, be reversed. Madame Lemaire, as Urbain, exhibits decided cleverness ; but her mi personation generally cannot bo cited as attractive; nor are wo abi-* b accord more than a word of encouragement to Mademoiselle tlrarnb 11a. who. though young and promising, with & voice, too, that is sweet and at tho sazno time ilexible, is con-aiderably overtaxed by the very difficult music which Meyerbeer has allotted to the Queen of Navarre.
The opera is placed upon the stage with great care and completeness, and tho addition of a fe ’ more stringed instruments would liave made even the orchestra (directed by signor Aiditi) unexceptionable. The performance, although it, commenced at, 8 o’clock, did not terminate until h;:J.£ ±kl lour ujfter midnight,,

The appeaganca of Mademoifidla Picoolomihl for the first ' time since her return from jlcnerica, attracted a crowded •-aadicnce lani night to the Italian Opera, I>rurydane, Of course, JSo Traviata was the work selected for the Important ■‘event, and the favourite little- artist found herself In the presence of an audienoe well disposed to revise the pleasant reminiscences of the season when she camo «pan London, as a new sensation. Her admirers will-be rejoiced to learn that she is not a whit changed-Voiee, marine'", abandonment to situation, are all as they! were, and stis dies'as bravely as ever through the whole' of the th ',rd act, her dnot with Signer Giugiini thrilling through all who hear the familiar strain of misery and: passion. Boundless applause followed the descent of the curtain.

Smith's Benefit takes place on Wednesday next, the 6th of July, when ho solicits the patronage of his friends mki subscribers, on which occasion Seven Acts from Seven different Operas will lr»e given, introducing all the eminent artistes »ff the eefcabliubment. Mr. E. T. Smith at tho close of the lirsfc subscription of 60 nights, and terminating on this evening (Saturday), in respectfully returning thanks to the nobility, gentry, his patrons, and the subscribers for the very liberal patronage bt’wtnwed upon hie efforts, hopes iio may he permitted to call atteution to the performance of the promises made In hia preliminary programme, each of whi h he trusta it will be ackoow 1 edged has been n alizod to the letter. N»d only has every artist announced appeared but at, a lavish expense, immediately on her arrival, the services of Mdlle. Ptccoloininl were secured, together with those of Mona. Belart and Vluletti, In order to carryout his determination of bringing together thn mo?t renowned and most exalted talent of Europe. Too débutants introduced have earued the warm suffrages of tbo public, and have, rnnoo their rwlv.mt ir. London, taken a high and merited rank. When it la considered that tho troupe has oonwHtefl of bIx prime donne. Mdllea Tl tiens, Guarducci. Balte, Brambilla, Vranon, and Picooloniirvl ; f >ur tenori, *VfM. Mongiul Qrar.laai, Belart, aud Giugliol : tour baritoni, MM. Fagotti, Merouriaii, Dinelli, and Badiall; four bawl, Marini. Vialefcti, Lauzoni, and Gasteili, with effective artists for tho minor rules, rendering each performance perfect as a whole ; together With an efficient chorus, selected from the mont able chorister» of England, the continental theatres, and mimical societies: an or-ch entra, full and complote, comprising the leading arti.it« and well-known soloists and Instrumentalists, viz , Tolbeoque. Viotti, Collins, Thbflwall. Griesbach, Schroure, Vogel, Piv/.i, Klein«, GllardonJ, KMgl, Horn usât Torriani, Lavigr.e, Bteiglich, &c.. led by the batons of those eminent Conductor«. MM. Benedict and Ardlti, It will be admitted that no effort has been spared to opta-blish firmly and triumphantly the highest order of Italian Opera at almost a nommai price of admis'lcn compared with the extravagant charges of other operatic establishments, thereby striking at the root of that exclusiveness which ha« closed tho doors to the people, to whom the higher order of lyric art has hitherto been a sealed book. The personal comforts of tho audience have been studiously considered and carried out in the most recherché and luxurious manner. The appliances of tire scene have been entrusted t,o tho hands of the most oompetentln the'r respective departments. The scenery has been confided bo the pencil of tho acknowledged g'-eatest artist of the day in hiB speciality, aided by numerous able assistants. Tho stage management has boon under tho able direction of Mr. R. Roxby ; in fact, tho whole of tho foreign and artistic world luw been rendered tributary to tho delectation of tho public, forming n phalanx of talent, n»»t only unpro'odented, but previously unimaginable. The elements of tho great troupe engaged, ■a? it may be r*.eu and may be stated, without exaggeration, form material for three groat opera companies It is therefore with pride, gratification, and heartfelt gratitude Mr. E. T. Smith acknowledges tho recognition of his exertions in the war n support accorder! to him, and in the genuine and generous encomia of the entire press of London During the 60 representations 1~ operas will have been prodnoed in t-heir integrity, and with the most scrupulous attention to the mis«1 en »cône, viz. •—La Favori ta, fivo times; Il Trovatoro, nine +iir.‘n ■ La Sonnambula, four times ; Luoreziu Borgia, eight tim^s ; II Barbtere di Singli*, four times : Les Huguenote, four times : Lucia d1 Lammer-moor, three times ; La Travt ita, aoven time’ • Don Giovanni, five times; Rlgoletto, five times ; Tl G in ram en to, three times ; La Figlta del Reggi in eu to, twice The ballet department only calls for a tew passing remarks. Avail d>le talent waB secured to effect ali that was intended —namely diver'.isaemente : the Bervices of Mile. Boschetfci, one of the stars of the chorégraphie hemisphere, being n tabled ouly to give due effect to the Blight productions that have been offered to the public, in the forthc-oning 20 subscription nights, commencing on Monday next, .Inly 4tb, tho following works will be produced, which are now In active preparation aud rehearsal viz.. Norma, Purifcani, Nozze di Figaro, and (for the first t*mo in this country! Verdi’« great opera 1 Vo^pri Sicilian!. Every portion of the scenery will be painted expressly, the drosses new, the appointment, of the most gorgcu.u» description, while the whole personnel of the establishment will be brought into requisition in order that this magnificent work may be put upon tha stage in the mon. elaborate and pei feet style.

"Last night Mademoiselle Tietjeng played Norma for the , first time In this country, and with a success quite equal to any of her previous achievements. Her Lucre si a Borgia had proved so good that the highest expectations ' were entertained of her Norma ; and these were fully ! borne out. by the result. The house was crowded, and the reception accorded to Mademoiselle Tietjens quite enthusiastic.
, A performance of such merit and pretensions, however, deserves more than a passing notice, and we shall return to the subject. Meanwhile we can only add that the character of Pollio was sustained by Signor Mongini, who has never been heard to more advantage ; that of k? >;iea by Mademoiselle Brambiiia, an inefficient “ TMiinaa donna,'* but now exactly suited ; and that of Oroveso by Signor Vialetti, an intelligent and painstaking artist from Her Majesty's Theatre. The general execution of the opera was remarkably effective, Mr. Benedict conducted.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF M. W. B ALFE
ITALIAN OPERA, DRURY LANE. /(j>s^ \
A few words are due to Mademoiselle Tietiens, whose successful impersonation of Norma was barely recorded on the first occasion, and who repeated the character on Saturday night. Those who remembered the Norma of Mademoiselle Sophie Cruvelli (at Her Majesty’s Theatre in 1851) could hardly fail to notice many strong points of resemblance in the performance of Mademoiselle Ttetjens, who, if she possessed the lower notes of her predecessor, would be in many respects Cruvelli over again. That the Norma of the Viennese “ prima donna” is, for the most part, rather an exhibition of magnificent physical power than of subtle ap-preciafcion and deep feeling must be admitted. At the same time her general conception of the part is lofty, and, with a little more repose, the execu don would be equal to the conception. Her “ Casta Diva” is a brilliant display of vocalisation, especially in the second movement. In the grand trio (finale to Act 1), where the enraged and jealous Norma informed of his faithlessness by the unsuspecting Adalgfaa, confronts and abashes Pollio, Mademoiselle Tietjens puts forth immense dramatic energy, delivering the celebrated reproach, “ Ah non tremare Oh perfido,” with amazing force, and sustaining the passion of the scene with undiminished vigour until the curtain falls. The second act has also many fine points. We must be satisfied, however, to dwell upon the scene with the sleeping children, in which the conflicting emotions that agitate the bosom of Norma and lead to her ultimate abandonment of the purposed crime, when swayed by the more powerful dictates of maternal affection, are portrayed with great felicity ; the duet with Adalgisa, 54 Deh con te,” another brilliant vocal feat, and the ‘till more interesting situation in which Nonna, vain:y soliciting the false Proconsul to relinquish Adalgisa, gives vent to her fury and glorts over the threatened annihilation of her lover and all his race. The final sepne was, for the most part, admirable, although the exquisite apostrophe to Pollio, “Oual cor tradisti.5’ wanted tendornpa«» wMnh , nawr. tbeless, was fully atoned for by the passionate delivery of the confession and appeal to Oroveso on behalf of the children. To conclude, by her impersonation of Norma, Mademoiselle Tietjcna has added one more to the list of her successes. That, by means of study and reflection she may bring it still nearer to perfection is unquestionable; but, meanwhile, quite enough has been accomplished to warrant the highest eulogy.
Few singers have appeared to such advantage in the ungrateful part of Pollio as Signor Monglnl, to whose superb voice the music is thoroughly well suited, and whose general view of the character is manly, vigorous, and natural. There is so much of good in the Adalgisa of Mademoiselle Brambilla that we are justified in looking forward to her as a valuable acquisition in the repertory of which this engaging part is one of the most engaging ; and this is the more satis factory, inasmuch as to shine in the first place lies hardly within her means. We have already mentioned Signor Vialetti’s Oroveso as excellent.
The performance to-night, for the benefit oi Mr. Balfe, promises to be one of more thaD ordinary interest. Ija Zingara (the Italian version of The Bohemian OirJ) will be presented, with Mias Balfe, for the first time, as the heroine uf her father’s opera. The cast is otherwise attractive, including Mademoiselle Onarducci as the Gipsy Queen and Signor Giuglini as Thaddeus, a part in which he earned honourable distinction At Her Majesty’s Theatre.

Henri, a Sicilian, young and ardent of acknowledged brav ry, but unknown parentage, Is enamoured of Helena, whose suit she favours, on the understanding that he, too, shall unite with the liberator.* of h'8 native land. To thiß course, and wich Helena’s Iihjo.i in prospect, Henri cordially consorts ; but on du, covering that Moutfort is h*. i'.-.ther a oonflict between love, patriotism, and til al duty ensues, whio r-asults in Henri’s saving De Montfort s life— Helei a. unaware of Henri’s motive, disdainfully discords him.

Anotlicr remarkable novelty, in tho shape oi Signor ^ erdi’s grand serious opera. J/es VSprcs Sicilienncs—under the Italian title of I Veppri Siclliani—was produced le.st nighr., for the first time in this country, with incontestable success. The Vcprcs SictUdincs, brought out at the Academic Tmpcrlalo In 1854, is the only work whicii Signor \ ordi h&s avriiten for the great nation a! Op-, ra of .France -his Jerusalem (1847) being one of his earlier compos itions (I Lombardi), with alterations and additions for the occasion. The part of the heroine—tho Duchess Helen—was composed expressly for Wadcmciselie Sophie Cruvelli, to whoso magnificent voice and mean.» it wa» admirably suited. Others have attempted it since (including the promising JVadei.ioisello Moreau Sainti). but non» with anything approaching the same effect. Last night however, Rladtm-Uclle Tietjcns, by her splendid-di amati energy ami brilliant execution, proved tint Signal Verdi mi„bt have clone worse than select her for ills prir■;/ donna.

IT A LI	OPERA, DRÜRY-LANE.
------—-+ÎP-—----■
Tbo four I j performance of tho Vespri Sicílíani, on Saturday mgbb.^ WAS ajso tho last of tho present season, liad this opera b produced earlier, there can be little doubt but that treasury would have benefited cousulerably ; for, though tho piece itself, ia spifco of Its melodramatio and sp/ctacular character, appears somewhat heavy and spun ¿Ut, it is enriched with many of Signor Verdi's happiest ' thoaghts. Instance among others the fôte, with its spirited tarantella and pretty unaffected chorus, u Del piacer s’avanza l’ora,” in the barcarolle style (act ii.) ; the whole of the music to tho incidental ballet of the Four Seasons (which, being characteristic and sparkling from end to end, should not have been curtailed so unsparingly as at Drury-lane Theatre) ; tho duet for Hélène and Henri; the quartet for Hélène, Henri, Procid», and De Montforb, with chorus of mouks (“De proftmdU”), and chorus of women, soliciting mercy for the heroine and patriot, condemned to execution (act iv.)—tho most Ingenious example of concerted music in the opera ; tho bridal song of Hélène, “ Merco di lette amicho,” a bravura in bolero measure and accent ( which made tho fortune of the opera in Paris) ; and last, not least, the tenor romance for Henri, “ La brezza © leggia,} (act v.),than which SignorVerdi has inventad no more graceful melody. Tho oftener these aro heard the more likely are they to become popular. Moreover, the Vespri Siciliani afforded tho first opportnnity of bringing forward that universal favourite, Mademoiselle Tietjens, in a new part (new, at least, to her English patrons), and of exhibiting the splendid voice of Signor Mongini, for whom the music of Ilenri is in every respect well fitted, to the, greatest possible advantage. Nor could the barytone and bass parts (Do Montfort and Proclda) have been intrusted to more competent representatives than Signors Fagotti and Vialettl. That the opera was successful on the first night has already been recorded ; and it may be added that three subsequent performances have fully justified the verdict delivered on that occasion. In short, it may reasonably be concluded that the Vespri SicUiani will maintain its placo among the best operas of its composer. Next season may probably afford it a better chance.
On Saturday night the performance went off from first to last with unflagging spirit. Mademoiselle Tietjens never sang and acted more finely ; Signor Mongini scarcely ever before in a manner so thoroughly to warrant the belief that his continental reputation has not been built upon sand. When the curtain fell on tho third act, Air. E. T. Smith, being unanimously summoned, advanced before the footlights, and addressed the audience. He thanked them for tho warm reception accorded him at tho end of this the seventh year of his management. The Italian Opera season had included 81 representations on consecutive nights, during which only one disappointment had occurred. He (Mr. Smith) had brought out 14 operas, and trusted the public would consider he had fulfilled the Pledges entered into before the commencement of the season. In addition to tho artists announced in the printed prospectus, he had secured the services of Mademoiselle Piccolomini, Mi¿s Balfe, Signor Btlarfc, Signor Vialctti, and others of more or less noto. * It had always been his desire to fix the prices of admission at as low a rate a3 possible, and he had been more than repaid by tho amount of sympathy exhibited towards him by the public. The expenses of the season of 81 nights had exceeded 21,0007., but he was happy to say that, thanks to the liberal patronage of the public and the support he had obtained in excess of subscriptions, he was no loser. One instance he wished particularly to mention. A lady who had held a private box during the season sent him a letter that morning, enclosing 507., with the expression of her sympathy in his endeavours to produce high class operas at such a tariff as to place them within reach of the general public. Such a mark of generous appreciation encouraged him to persevere, and he would bring forward the same eminent artists next season, together with as many others as he could secure. He would scour Itoly in the recess, and all that he could find worthy to be heard by a British audience should figure on those boards. He begged to be allowed to return thanks to the ladies and gentlemen of the company for their zealous co-operation, to the members of the band, to the press, to his subscribers, and to the public generally, who, by their liberal and continued patronage, had shown that the existence of more than one Italian Opera was nob only possible, but desirable, in this metropolis. The address was frequently interrupted by loud applause. After the opera the national anthem was performed, Mademoiselle Tifctjens, by the earnest, emphatic, and intelligible manner in which she gave tho principal solos, reading a lesson by which nine foreign singers out of ten might profit.
That Mr. Smith has deserved well of his supporters can hardly be denied. He had to oontend against most inauspicious circumstances in the earlier and middle part of the season ; and if he has not sustained a very considerable loss he may fairly be congratulated. The 14 operas presented were the Sonnamlvla, with which the season began, and which brought forward Miss Balfe and the new tenor, Signor Mongini ; the Favorita, in which Mademoiselle Guarducci, one of tho most admirable artists on the Italian stage, was first introduced ; Lucre:la Borgia, for the dtbûls of Mademoiselle Tietjena and the accomplished tenor from Her Majesty’s Theatre, Signor Giuglini ; the Trovatore; the B ar bierc; the Huguenots, ono of the most creditable achievements of the company; Lucia; the Traviatef, for tho first appearance of Mademoiselle Savolta and Signor Ludovico Graziani, the tenor ; Don Giovanni; Itigoletto, in which two now “ prima donnas,” Mademoiselles Weiner and Elvira Brambilla, were successively essayed ; the Zíngara {Bohemian Girl); Norma ; II Giuramento, tho early demise of which foreshadowed a like result in another and a greater establishment ; and last, not least, tho Vespri Siciliani, the second novelty, which was just as favourably received as the first was snubbed by the
public. All theso operas wero more or less well executed, and some of them in a manner that would not have discredited any lyric theatro. Among tho new singers Mademoiselle Guarducci and Signor Mongini must bo regarded as real acquisitions—the position of the lady bAng firmly established from the beginning, that of the gentleman after con-siderablo doubt and hesitation. Of Mademoiselle Tiotjens, Signor Giuglini, Miss Balfe, Mademoiselle Piccolomini, Signor Badiall, and Signor Marini, already known to the public, it is enough to aay that they maintained their reputations. About the litigation connected with the non-ap-pcaranco of Signor Graziani (the barytone) and its results our readers know enough to make any further allusion to tho subject unadvisable. This gentleman's brother, Signor Ludovico Graziani, achieved a quati-.success ia the TraviaUh which, it may be remembered, was in a great measure confirmed by his performance inthe Giuramcnto. With regard to Madame Lemaire, a really excellent c<m,(raUo, who appeared as MafTeo Or^ini and Maddelena {Rigoleito) when those characters were abandoned by Mademoiselle Guarducci ; of the other tenors, barytones, basses, sopranos, and contraltos incl ded in this (from a numerical point of view) altogether U-Upiccedented company, we have nothing to add to what was s; fid, from time to time, in the regular notices of the transact ionu of the season. The ballet may bo dis. missed with » strong compliment to Mademoiselle Boschetti, one of the ancient stars in the Lumleyan hemisphere, and an adiu’^ion of tho general efficiency of the chorégraphie corps. Tho band, led by M. Tolbccque, —with Mr. Yiotti Collins as solo violin, Mr. Benedict and Signor Arditi os alternate conductors—was good, but, although numbering eminent performers in its ranks (to single out any of whom from the rest would be invidious)* might, for evident reasons, »have been Improved. Tho chorus, on the other hand, was by no means satisfactory.
To conclude,'.with much to criticise but much more to praise, Mr. Smith’s experiment has exhibited » degree of enterprise and spirit that entitles him to the consideration of the operatio public, and especially to that large section of it winch cannot afford to pay high prices.

ITALIAN OPERA DR XTTt Y-LANE.	. „
OzjriL,	---------------- <PSJ
A very crowded audience was attracted last night by the opera of Imcia di Law,mer moor, the part of the heroine being sustained by Mademoiselle Piccolomini. This was the first of a\ «Ties of performances» under the denomination of ** farewell nights»” the vivacious little “ prima donna” being Bhortlv about to revisit her native Italy. Something Of the kind was called for, and it was impossible to have liad a more brilliant inau guration. The house was not only full but enthusiastic beyond the accustomed limits. That Mademoiselle Piccolo in ini is immensely popular with the majority of playgoers, there can be no question; nor would it be a very difficult task to account for the species of popularity she enjoys. There never was an actress more at home with her audience, more confident of sympathy, and therefore more ii ^roughly at her ease. That at any, even the earliest, part of her career Mademoiselle Piccoiominl could have been whAt is termed “ nervous,” It is difficult to believe. From the outset she must have tripped before the foot lights, counting on success as a matter of course, and, as a matter of course, obtaining it. Without greatly troubling herself «bout the niceties’' of art, without considering high finish indispensable, or the integ:;oyo£ texts a ¿ine qu&non, the does whatever she does with such a pretty selfcomposure, such a piquant disdain of ordinary conventionalities, such an uncalculating ingenuousness,that the most exacting connoisseur scarcely finds it in his heart to be angry with her, however she may fail short of hi? ideal. We need not remind our musical readers that the part of Tmcia is the very last that Donizetti, had he lived to become acquainted with her talent, would have destined for Mademoiselle Piccolomini. The music, as it stands in the score, does not stand within reach of her mean and appliances; in short, she could not, under any tircamstancea, execute it literally« Yet, nothing daunted» she makes a Lucy of her own, and a very engaging, pas-eionate, and interesting Lucy, too. Whr.t puzzle? her in •fche music she lias 3uch a way of getting ov^r as ale no would prove her an uncommonly expert and clever person. Who that had listened to Persian! and Boslo in the mad scene, revelling in ornaments and graces, the v cry perfection of the florid school of singing, could have ira?^ined for one instant Mademoiselle riceolomini producing any effect whatever ? And yot that she does produce effect, not merely there, but in the other important situations of the opera— important alike from a musical and dramatic point of view —- no one who lias heard her can deny. In the love duet with Edgardo (Act 1), in the duet with her brother, in the Scene of the contract and the malediction, and in that of the catastrophe already named, Mademoiselle Piccolo* mini exhibits earnestness of purpose, strong feeling, and originality. She accomplishes everything after a manner c£ her own—a wilful, impetuous, occasionally childish manner, it may be. but intensely real nevertheless—so much so as to extort the admission that her whole heart is in her task. Hence the position, she maintains, and will probably continue to maintain, though the refinements of vocalization remain, as they are likely to do, for ever beyond the pale of her achievements. Her reception last night was most flattering, and whatever she did when intent upon making an impression was rapturously appreciated. That at the end of every act she was recalled before the curtain may be taken for granted.
The Edgardo of the evening was Signor Belarc, a Spanish tenor whom Mr, Lumley was first to introduce to the Eng ilsh dilettanti* Asa fluent vocalist this gentleman has few superiors, but the music of Rossini suits him letter than that of Donizetti. Signor Bellart is, however, in the fullest acceptation of the w ord an artist; and both in the duet with Lucia and in the famous “ Fra poco” created a legitimate sensation, fairly dividing the honours of the evening with Mademoiselle Piccolo in ini. The other parts were les8 efficiently sustained. The orchestra, directed by Signor Biletta, was satisfactory, but the chorus left much to be desired.
The TrairtUa and the Trovatore »re the other operas in which Mademoiselle Piccolomini is tc take leave. In the former her reputation is notorious ; in the latter, if we are 1 not mistaken, she has yet to be judged by the tendon nablic.

luY-1^ DRURY*LANE THE A TRE.
The Promenade Concerts, which have been for some time announced, began on Saturday night with a programme of varied attractions. The theatre was well filled, although the pit alone was crowded. No very extensive process of decoration appears to have been resorted to in fitting up the interior, but as the concerts are only intended to last a fortnight this trait of prudential economy is readily accounted for. The orchestra is erected much in the same manner a3 that to which the public have been accustomed at the familiar entertainments of M. Jullien. Herr Manns, Director of Music at tho Crystal Palace, upon whose shoulders de-
Ivolve the responsibilities of conductor, has furnished a band of excellent players, many of the best of whom are members of the Sydenham troop of executants (all the chiefs, we believe, with the somewhat important exception of Mr. Horatio Chipp, solo violoncellist), while the others are from well tried sources. Thus, for cornet-ii pistons (principal) we have M. Duliem (M. Jullien’s most recent exportation) ; for flute, Mr. Wells ; for oboe, Mr. Crozier ; for clarinet, Mr. Papé; for bassoon, Mr. Hutchings; and for leader (“ckif d’attaque” is the modern denomination for that once prominent and indispensable official), Mr. Wedemeyer— the last having at his elbow, as “ second first fiddle,” no less practised and experienced an artist than Mr. Willy. Not to go into further details, the thunder of the gentleman who belabours tbe kettle-drums, from tho mid-summit of the orchestra, penetrates everywhere, and adds materially to the force, if not to the richness, of tho harmony. Altogether Herr Manns has provided a very efficient band, the capacity of which was severely, and at tho same time favourably, tested in the first part of the programme, consisting exclusively of selections from the most popular works of Mendelssohn.
That the audience was a inoro orderly audience than used to besiege the doors, and almost break down the barriers before the appointed hour, in order to take part in tho “ spree” that had become a sort of tradition on M. Jullien’s “first nights,” was evident from the placid ebullition of loyalty caused by tho first performance of tho National Anthem. In the second part of the concert, however, the patriotic ardour waxed more intense at the end of Herr Manns’ “.Rifleman’s March,”a spirited and somewhat bruyant effusion, terminating effectively with Par-cell’s heroic song, “ Come if you dare,” which of recent ears has been so closely identified with the name of Mr. ims Reeves. This was unanimously redemanded, and played again to the evident gratification of alL At the end of the concert the same kind of demonstration was elicited by the second performance of “ God save tbe Queen,” played to order, and to which was added, in obedience to a loud and general call, “ Rule Britannia.” Nevertheless, tho “ patriots” of tbe promenade, who were wont to be excited to such a pitch of frenzied exaltation by the emphatic gyrations of M. Jullien’s baton, and to join in the burden of the well-known airs with such uproarious good-will, were missed ; and on this particular occasion it can hardly be said that they “ shone by their absence.”
Among the most remarkable achievements of the band must be cited the Scherzo in G minor, from the symphony in C minor (abridged from the Ottet, and scored for the orchestra, by the composer himself), one of those movements in which tho genius of Mendelssohn first displayed itself in the fullness of its power and originality. This was given to perfection—much better, indeed, than the symphony in A maj -r, with which the concert began. The other orchestral piece in the fi rst part was the inimitable Wedding March, of course well rendered, and of course heard with the utmost gratification.
The solo instrumentalist was If. Wieniawski, whose execution of the justly celebrated violin concerto would have satisfied Mendelssohn himself—than which higher praise cannot be awarded. Independently of his very striking performance, moreover, the musical part of the audience was indebted to M. Wieniawski for disregarding the announcement of the programme, in which only the first allegro was set down, and presenting the masterpiece as it was written, without curtailment. That the accomplished “ virtuoso” had not over-estimated the taste of his hearers was shown in the result. Never was fine music finely rendered more thoroughly appreciated. Applauded “to the echo” after each successive movement, M. Wieniawski was unanimously summoned forward at the conclusion.
The same success attended the Car naval de Venue (preceded by Herr Ernst’s exquisite andante) later in tho evening, when the Polish violinist, probably elevated by his Mendelssohnian triumph, surpassed himself, both in the number of his feats and the style of their accomplishment. Wo never remember him playing so many variations, or with such uniform brilliancy, never more completely enchaining and fascinating his hearers. The vocalist of the evening—Madame Lcmmens Sherrington—was also an unequivocal “ hit.” In tbe first part she sang one of the genial and delightful May-songs of Mendelssohn, who in this attractive branch of composition equalled and even at times surpassed Schubert himself (“ lied- mcisicr ”— as, by general consent, ho has been termed by his compatriots). In the second art, Madame Lemmens gave, with admirable fluency and feet, tho great scene, “Ombre Legere” from Meyerbeer’s Dinorah. In both instances she was remarkably successful, for the first encore substituting a Scottish ballad, and in obedience to the second repeating the final strain of Dinorah’s piquant and fanciful apostrophe to her own shadow.
In the printed programme we find the following superscriptions :—“ The first part is selected entirely from the works of Mendelssohn ;”—“ The second part will oonsist of
I light and cheerful music.” Now, this is by no means complimentary to Slendelssohn, whose music, if the contrast or antithesis means anything, must be set down as heavy and dull. Besides, if we may judge by the reception accorded to M. Wieniawski in the violin concerto (which carried away the chief honours of the evening), to say nothing of the exhilarating brightness of the Wedding March, so irresistible in its effect; and if, to go further, we may compare these with the late Otto Nicolai’s extremely prosy overture to one of the least prosy of comedies (The Merry Wives of Windsor), which was the prominent orchestral display In Part IL, it must be owned that in the qualities of “ lightness and cheerfulness” Mendelssohn had it all his own wav, and that the audience only followed a reasonable instinct in applauding him with so much more warmth and heartiness than they applauded Nicolai. Then, again, in Macfarren’s graphic and interesting comments, the programme gives the lie to its own superscriptions. Otherwise what are we to think of the following (perfectly justified) rhapsody about the last movement of the symphony in A major ?—
" The SaitarellQ tella its own tale. It is no stretch of the Imagina* tion to suppose tho Carnival, with the vivacity that here is known but as a traveller’s tale, of the quick-hearted Italian, the ubiquitous life, the perpetual motion, the sunshine all through and through one’s feel” ings and one's thoughts, and its reflection on our actions and our in. fluence on others ; the romp, the rhapsody, the roystering revelry, the rattling riot, the rustling, rolling, ridiculous, restless, ranting roar of tho rollicking holyday. when misrule and nonsense are the law and intelligence that will and direct what is utterly beyond control ; the bustling, hustling, jostling of everlasting intricacies of the interminable labyrinth of the never-emling, never-beg in uing, universal and oxnniversal dance. Good spirits, indeed !"
Surely the movement which elicited such an outburst must be in some measure “ cheerful.” Not, however, that the second part of the concert was by any means contemptible. On the contrary, in addition to the RijlcmarCs March, already mentioned, it comprised a very lively set of quadrilles by Herr Manns founded on the venr lively opera of Martha ; a fantasia on airs from Weber’s JPreciosa (unmeaningly entitled “ Sketches of Gipsy Life”), in which the solo-playing of Messrs. Crozier, Pape, and Wells, on the oboe, clarinet, and flute, was conspicuously exhibited; a “ vaisc” (waltz?) by Lanner ; and a galop by Kcenig, the latter “ expressly arranged for these concerts”—not, it may be assumed, by the composer, who has been dead some time. Herr Manns, who conducted with his accustomed spirit, zeal, and ability, should be told, however, not to bow to the audience in acknowledgment of any other applause [than that which greets his own particular arrangements. One might have imagined, from his manner of proceeding, that “ Mendelssohn” and “ Nicolai” were “ noms de guerre,” under the shadow of which Herr Manns had been accustomed to address the world as a composer—such as M, Jullien did with “ Koch-Albert,” and the Baroness Dude-vant with “ Georges Sand.”
One word acknowledging the efficient arrangements of the commissariat department, under the direction of Mr. Strange —who, like Herr Manns, nocturnally migrates from the Crystal Palace for the occasion, and, if Rumour errs not more capriciously than usual, represents in propria persond the “ committee of gentlemen” so desirous of perpetuating Promenade Concerts in this country—and we have done.
To-night some music by Beethoven will constitute tho first part of the programme, including, among other things, the violin concerto, by M. Wieniawski—who will doubtless show the same courtesy to Beethoven which he bo honourably exhibited towards Mendelssohn,
