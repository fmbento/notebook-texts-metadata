On TUESDAY,

HARD 'twas for Bart! of Bath in former days,
Subjects to find deserving of his lays;
For, sooth to say, in those same by-gone times,
Until furnisli'd little for the man of rhymes:
LitHe—compar'd with this our present town ;
As, on n glance at both, you'll freely own.
First, then, of Bath that was i—when shall it be?
Suppose—far back in the last eentury.
How could the Poet then invoke hw Muse
To sing of lappets, hoops and highJteeVd skaes?
Of days—when Beaux wore wigs and ruffled shirts;
And Nymphs, in powder and pomade, were flirts '
When Gentry dined at two and suop'd at tight.
And sir was, for a Party, somewhat late;
When shops were scanty, and the pavement rough,
And one small Library was quite enough
When the Bath monde might in n parlour meet;—
And what now seems a lane—was called a street;
When Toasts and Marcamnis might be seen
Group'd in their only lounge—the Bowling-Green t
Wiien in Beau Nash their Law-giver they found,
And when their Theatre was under ground f
When the Stage Coach's coming made a Wonder,
And Bath from London was two days asunder.
Such were old times; but—let us change the view,
And lo! how much beyond them are the new.'
For one sweet tyrant then—we now have got
More than one hundred beauties:—have we not?
Were there a doubt in Bath that beauty reigns,
But look around—and not a doubt remains !
Again look round—Mw gorgeous pile behold—
And say what Theatre—or new—or old,—
Can be to this preferred ? Why—'tis a Fane—
Of which e'en Athens' self might have been vain :
Which graceful rises—as a school refin'd,
To mend the manner'?—and exalt the mind-

MAJESTY'S

ACCESSION,

XtMOB I, 1981.

Shall we, in quest ot talent—or the Art*,
Leave Bath, and seek for ttttsa id distant parts?
Forbid it proper pride, pure taste, ami sense;—
'Tis hers to lead in more than elegance:
In Genius, witness BARKER'S splendid name.
And LODPII'S strains, that rival Cramer's fame;—
And if of Anstey's verse old Bath was proud,
Let modern Bath in BAYLY'S praise be loud.
But—truce with this:—for all that Bath supplies
Of what is Lovely, Letter'd, flood and Wise,
He who would count—might just as well tell o'er
The willows on her Avon's winding Bliore,
Her groves enumerate, and verdant meads,
Or reckon half her charitable d e d s I
Here Virtue stil! the garb of Pleasure wears,
And frolic Mirth can drop soft Pity's tears,
And Mrrrivxent put on the rosy wreath,
While nobler motives stir the soul beneath :
Sport the pretence—Benevolence the end,
The Stek to aid, the Friendless to befriend:
Or—as to night—when Gaiety and Glee
Are symbols of a City's LOYALTY !
This goodly show of Rank, and Wit, and Wealth,
Of Female fascination, Youth, and Health,
This bright Assemblage—is, in tact—no less
Than LOVE OP COUNTRY in a comic dress,
Tn cheerfulness assum'd—to grace the Day
Mark'd for an bononr'd ANNIVERSARY J
In Memory to keep th' auspicious hour
Which plac'd the Sceptre of Britannia's power
In gallant WILLIAM'S gen'rous hand—and made
Queen of our land—and hearts—fair ADELAIDE!
Long may they live-—and Jive—as now—revered—
And their lov'd Names with cheers of .?oy be heard!

To which tviil be added, (LAST TIME.) the favorite PANTOMIME ot

OBI;
Or, T H R E E - F I N G E R E D JACK.
[This interesting Drama is founded on a most mischievous Superstition, long current amongst the Negroes in the
West indies, who firmly believed in a species of Witchcraft, known bv the name of OBI ; and were so entirely the
slaves of their own fears, that many died, victims of imagination, under the supposed influence of the OBI malediction: whilst those who were favored by the pretended Sorcerers, were considered invulnerable, and rioted with
impunity in every description of crime. A notorious Robber, called THIIEK-FINGKHEP JACK, was, for many years, the
Hero of this detestable imposture; and, under the protection of an Om WOMAN, became the terror of all around him.
The flagrant outrages committed by this desperado, with the discovery of his haunt, and subsequent destruction by a
Black Boy, named TUCKEV, and two Slaves, QIMSHKK and SAM, are Historical Facts j and, with a series of wellauthenticated circumstances, are here skilfully wrought into one of the most successful Pantomimic Dramas ever
produced upon the British Stage.]

inteseet, than the M U T I N Y AT T H E NORE, in 1797.—Forty Thousand men, to whom the Nation looked for defence, and in steadfast reliance of whose bravery it
laid down every night in tranquility—men who had dared every thing for their Country, and in whose breasts patriotism could never be extinguished ; turned the
(,«!-•< which they had so often manned in defence of the English Flag, against their own Countrymen, and their own Home, and stetned determined to sacrifice the

Will take place on TUESDAY next, MAY 14, 1833,

in 3 acts, of powerful interest, called

1 JnJb M I n l i l l
OF

Forty Footsteps
This Phiy is founded on Miss Jane Porter's celebrated story of the same name, and is constructed on a strange and eventful circumstance which occurred
in one of the Fields now built over in Gower Street, London, in the immediate vicinity of Bloomsbury Square, called the LONG F I E L D S , between Tottenham
Court-road, and a rustic Lane eastward, which ran from the top of Southampton Row towards Hampstead, and the first stone of the New London University
was laid at the North Western extremity of the remaining remnant of the Long Fields.
In one of those Fields the marks as if of human Footsteps presented themselves, bearing the appearance of a regular advance and retreat of two persons
engaged in mortal combat; and although the grass stood high and rich on all the rest of the ground, not a blade grew on the apparent Footsteps. This strife,
>*-> the tradition states, was between T W O BROTHERS, both of whom perished, and took place during the Commonwealth. Upon its brief memorial and a
i K VDIM; INCIDENT in a popular Novel, the above Drama is constructed. On its production in the Metropolis, its success was so decisive that the Plav was acted
SEVENTY SUCCESSIVE NIGHTS with enthusiastic applause.
