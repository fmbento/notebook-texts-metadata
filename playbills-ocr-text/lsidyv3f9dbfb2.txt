DRUBY-LANE, f
A laigar oonootuw of people probably never assembled within the walls of Drniy-laue Theatre than on Hatnrday night, to witness tha now Christmas pantomime, which under the vigilant ausploes of Ur. E. T. Smith, baa been for soma time in preparation. To render the oooaeion still more interesting that enterprising gentleman—^“pet-lessee” of the Drary-lane Committee (In oonaequenee of his strict veneration for rent-day ?)—had busily smployed himself during the reoeag In renovating the interior of the house. An aspect of splendour combined with cleanliness is now presented, and. In addition, the new deoorations are not merely bright aad cheerful to the eye, but appropriate and in good taste.
If on the first night of Christmas festivities managers could be persuaded to commence at onoe with the ohief incident, and allow the pantomime to raign unmolested, snob a oourse might lead to many deairable advantages. To begin, there would be a good ohanoe of seeing the curtain descend before midnight, an Innovation greatly to be coveted. The first performance of a pantomime is, at best, a rehearsal, to witness wbioh the (paying) publio is invited. As this is only a preliminary to tha curtailments that invariably ensne; it generally consumes at lewt an hour longer than subsequent representations, when, the indis-penasUe “outs" having been etfeotsd, the action marches with greater rapidity, the meohanioal oootrivauoes are realised more glibly, and the whole works “ closer.“ fn thelnext plaoe,—and this is worth consideration—aotors and aetrssws who enjoy the esteem of the public would be spared tbe ungrateful labour of gestioulating through a play In dumb-show, an. Id the deafening exclamations of an impatient crowd. The French	have what they
term "hvtr-de-rideau"—a short pieoe, during the performance of whioh, at thoir great theatres, the andienoe have time to get oomfortably seated, in anticipation of the real attmetion of tbe evening ; but the “ lever-dt-ridean” which aota the part of usher to an English pantomime has not to enoounter tbe silent tndifierenee of straggling and late arrivals, but the absolute scorn and noisy opposition of a multitude that fills the house to overflow before the orchestra has struok the first chord of the overture. Seriously, those respectable artists who are made to figure in such an exhibition are exposed to useless humiliation. The faroe of Too much of a good thing, in whioh the prinaipal characters were “ mimed” by Miss Mary Oliver, Mrs. Frank Matthews, and Mr. Koxlby (for not a word they were preeumed to utter could be heard, even in the stalls)—all well-deserving favourites of the
Sublio—suggested the above reflection. On Seturday night lie inhabitants of tbe “ upper regions ” were more unruly, uproarious, and obstinately overbearing than in any previous instance we oan remember. Tbe unfortunate '‘pit “ was never more aptly tbe symbol of a ‘* dust-hole ” (a chosen epithet of the aggressive ** gods “); and it was highly creditable to the oocupants that they submitted to tnoessant annoyance with snoh rarely pertnrbed good humour. How easily these exoesses might be averted by limiting tbe spectacle on Boxing night to the pantomime — end how reasonably, since not a man, woman, or child in the theatre has oome to see anything else—will be evident to the plainest understanding.
The name of the new ramie pantomime—the introduction to which is by Mr, E. L. Blanchard, the mnsio by Mr, J. H, Tolly, and the sranery by Mr. William Beverley—is so long that our readers must tie satisfied with a slim of it— Little Jack Horner ; or Harlequin ABO. The opening is a bnrlssque allegory, whioh we bold to bo a mistake. People do not expect to be edified or Instructed at a pantomime, but to laugh “ quoad mime” (any how). “ Ignorance,” “ Intelligence," “ Imagination,” ** Perseverance,” “ Anagram,” “Proverb,” ki, may do famously as symbolioal personages in a poem; but in a pantomime they are rather bores tun otherwise. Thus the commencement of the bnr-lesqne, where “ IntelUgenee" is engaged In strife against “ Ignoranoe,” only becomes interesting when “ Imagination,” enlisted on the side of the former, oonveys ns to one of her own airy castles, In the precinot« of which we are treated to a splendid cboregraphio display. Here “ nearly 100" fair daughters of Tarpsiohore, with that clever, and vivacious “scorner of the ground,” Mias Rosins Wright (“ Rosy Wright,” m she is familiarly termed by her admire»} as Queen, arrayed in etherial and sparkling on-tnmes, executed e series of evolutions, under the name of “ Grand Ballet of the BeUes Lettres,” which, allegorical or literal, mattered little to the audience, since it was the first thing to ronse their enthusiasm. Miss Rosina Wright danced in her most animated style, and (not for the first time by many) put the house in good humour with tbe pantomime, which from that moment never onoe1 * flagged.” What part Is ensoted by little Jaek Horner in the burlesque may be briefly told. Jack has a good and a bad demon—“ Intelligence” and “ Ignorance,” besides a hoary Mentor, in the guise of ‘1 Proverb." This last oommendable sage admonishes Jack to give heed to “ Intelligence," and strives to allure him from the dangerous temptations of “ Ignorance,” who hannts our hero as pertinaciously as Zamiel dogs Caspar In the opera. “ Proverb” eventually triumphs. Endowing bis pnpll with tha sword of “ Perseverance,” he excites him to attack and oonquer tha various “ parts of speech." With
despatches him on a sham mission to tbe depths of the ocean. But the depths of the ocean oannot esoape the searching power of “ Intelligence,” who by aid of the ■ lectrio cable oomes to the rescue of her protfgi, and entertains him in her Pales# of Coral, or “ Fairy Aquarium,” as it Is designated in the imaginative vocabulary of pantomime Tbe contest terminating In this viotory carries the audianoe through a succession of grotesque soenes, in the course of which all tbs letters of tbe alphabet and all the parts of speeeh are personified, while the familiar incidents of the nursery rhyme are represented in action. Suffice it, tbe “transformation” (if ■* transformation" that may be railed where the pantomimic characters spring from nowhere) occurs, suddenly and unexpectedly, at tha 11 Fairy Aquarium,” one of the most gorgeoua, ingenious, and magnificent of all thosa elaborate soenlo combinations for wbioh Mr. W. Beverley Is specially oelebrated. No description oan do justice to this deoomttve display, wbioh must be seen to be appreciated. As its wondsrs gradually revealed themselves, and the circumambient air, no loss than terra jirma, became densely peopled with floating nymphs and soaring fairies, tbs applause was vociferous and continuous, and a summons, first for Mr. E. T. Bmith, the manager, and next for Mr. Beverley, the artist, represented the olimex of eioitement A halo of bine fire and electrio light from tbo “ wings” then threw an unearthly glare over the whole; and the oonelnsion unanimously arrived It was, that such a seen« would alone have Insured success.
The harlequinade (and this, after all, moat nearly oonoems the abstract love rof pentomlne), though unnecessarily complex on account of tne multiplication of the characteristic personages, Is, on the whole, the liveliest, most amusing, and varied that has bean witnessed for years. Bo exoellent is It, indsed, as not merely to warrant but to render advisable a very considerable abridgment of the far less diverting introduction. In order that no one may bedeterred by late hours from remaining till the end. The dramatic penona; in this legitimate and traditionally-respected section at the entertainment inolude Harlequins (Messrs- Milano and St. Maine); Handy (M. Hoeiln); Sprites (Meters. Elliott); Clowns (Messrs. Boleno and Flexmore); Pantaloons (Messrs. Nash and W. A. Bsrnes); Harlequlna (Mademoiselle Agnes) : Columbines (Madame Boleno and Mademoiselle Christine)—an “ embarrae de rxcheute,” it will be admitted. The Messrs. Elliott are remarkably elever, but their servioee are almost superfluous, since now that ourolowns themselves are expected to assume, and in most instances do assume, tbe functions of «orobats, what need Is there of tumbling, attitudinising nondescript« whose connexion with the regular “ business” is worse than problematioal ? Again, ” Harlequlna” is surely out of plaoe where there are already two Columbines—neither of whom, by the way, take any notioe of one whose relationship to their spangled mate« from its suspicions nature, would naturally excite their jealousy. And this, without depreciating tbe talent of Mademoiselle Agnes, decidedly the most sprightly and fascinating of the three ladle« The rival Harlequin« Clown« and Pantaloons may be admitted without protest, as they may figure in alternate soene« while their respective adventures have nothing in oommon. Moreover, there is plenty for them all to do tn the Drary* lane pantomime; and the untiring energy and spirit with which they perform their arduous tasks is oreditahle to one and all of their representative« Declining to venture on a detailed acoouDt of the vsrions incidents of the harlequinade, we may single ont from many stirring soenes one in particular— “Mra. Soapsnd’s Laundry and Drying-ground” —as full of life and bnstl« admirable in every respect, in short, a veritable “ slde-spUtter.” H®ra Mr. Flexmore— who to tbe supple attributes of our modern Clown, a hybrid. Inconsistent, posture-making buffoon, unites a large share of that sly humour and loutish demeanour whioh in the days of Joe Grimaldi, when to represent Clown successfully belonged only to real histrionic talent, were regarded as the essenoe of that parsonage-exhibited his several accomplishments with singular felicity, eliciting roars of laughter without intermission. Mr. Flexmore, Indeed, is the life and soul of the pantomime, and the audience hold him in such esteem that whatever he attempts is sure to find favour. Unqualified praise mar be also awarded to Mr. Bsrnes, a Pantaloon of the good old type—infirm and shattered, yet instinot with mischief, and always a victim of scrapes, in whioh he becomes entangled by bis more versatile and flexible companion. Nor must the racy type of”a dandy of fashion, by M. Deulin, pass unnoticed.
The trioks and transformations are more ingenious and in more rapid alternation than Of later year« and, considering this was the first performance, were attended for the most
iiart with wonderful good luok. Tbe allusions to prevalent opies embrace almost every subject th-t has lately attained notoriety; and tbe number of supernumeraries is so large, their «ting so natural, and their forbearance under countless hardships of the ‘ ‘spill and pelt" so magnanimous, that it might almost be believed Mr. E. T. Smith kept a oholoe preserve of them somewhere In tbe neighbourhood of his establishment. To conclude, pains and expense have evidently not been spued in the endeavour to provide the holyday folks with a surfeit of enjoyment; and nothing is required but a judicious use of the pruning-knife in certain lengthy pas-ssgee of the introductory burlesque to insure for Little Jack Horner, or Harlequin ABO (afternoon representations of wbioh, by the way, are annonnoed for every Wednesday) a long and prosperous “ ran.”

To ■ avenge a mother who. was not hia. mother, and a brother who was not hia brother, he has thrown away everyprospect of happiness. Luckily his notions of instioe are ao severe, and he is so tln.ronghly satsafied that he-deserves-these heavy blows of forte no, that the DucHess puts the compromising documents into the fire, and allows him to remain as true a Duuois aa ever was sung in “ Partant laByrie.” He likewise marries the liucitesa, altar a.

The musical entertainments for which Passion-week hag . Of Into yoar* bam distinguished began in good earnest last night The announcement that the English Opera company, which had gained such well deserved popularity at the T.jrcenm Theatre, under the management of Miss Lotus* 1 Vyne and Mr. Harrison, were to give a series of concerts during the temporary suspension of their operatlo tour in

The second part -at a wholly different oliaraoter, bul . J wW equally blameless in its way—was made up of “ popular** 'HOI tuusi« from all sources. The “ classical” features In the 12jJT Instrumental department were, of course, the symphony of i $/ Beethoven, the concerto of Moiart, and the overture of

11 The wiuged storms, chautins their thunder psalm,* let loose their fury ; the abatement of the tempest, the joyful song of the herdsmen, and the evening orison—these, or rather the impressions they oonvey to an ardent and contemplative mind, were the materials which suggested to Beethoven a musical poem that is imperishable. Mr. Mel-

fresh and genial melody, however, such playful fancy, such ingenious and yet ’ apparently simple treatment (so «’ artfully is the musician’s art conoealed). cannot fail to please an audienoe alive to the inliuence of harmony —more especially when the execution in ideal perfection approaches to the level of the music. This wan the case with the pley' ing of Miss Arabella Ooddard, to whose enthusiasm is duo ! '#*1 the revival of so many neglected works by the greatest -H masters. Ho pianist has entered into the spirit of MosarVs j ' music with more kindred feeling than this accomplished
, lady, who, with the spontaneous fluency indispensable to its proper effect, unites a

. _	,	a truth and unstudied simpiioity of ex-
pression that, if possible, add a new grace to that which is grace itself. Mbs Goddard, moreover, takes Mozart as she ! finds him, and, with a confidence never misplaced, presentg his text in its integrity without ohauges, or what are, oddly enough, term- 3 ‘‘embellishments ■, nor does -ho ever ‘ ‘	‘ ‘ overdrawn ncccntnation, but
c unaided medium of gennino fling. The ooncerto in 0 major was com-
t«*
g. posed so long before the Pastoral Sj/mphoni/ that it might ' nave been thought dangerous to put it in close juxtaposition with so formidable a rival; but the truth is that
*jNMP
• real inspiration of genius is never out of place, sohn’s dramatic and splendid overture to jRtti/ Bai, played
Mendels-
MMM(
with immense spirit, terminated the first part most effectively.
In Part II. the well-known (and considerably hackneyed) Trovatore “ selection” displayed the skilful solo
I (laying at Messrs, flatten (flute), Barret (oboe); Lazarus clarinet), Hughes (opliicteide), and others, to eminent advantage. This description of mmio is separated from what preceded it by an immeasurable distance ; but that it ha- its admirers was satisfactorily proved last night. The brilliant and extremely difficult fantasia on airs from 9 Ottl/n was performed by the young and rising English L Tiolinist, Mr. Carrodus, with admirable dexterity, ami the wonder was that, with his instrument so completely under control, he should not have strictly adhered to the text at 1 . Herr Brest. Mr. Sidney Flatten, in Ms own solo on the lYo-i tftvntors, exhibited his accustomed ability and established his , claim to be regarded as one of the first of English flautists.
. m The vocal music was by no means on a par with the in' ' strumental , but this was in a great measure accounted for by the absence of Miss Louisa Pyne, who lias recently been prevented from fulfilling her public dnties through • severe domestic affliction. Mademoiselle Finoli did her best to atone for the loss of the celebrated English songstress, and in “ Una voupoco fa” gave evident» of the poo* session of a fine voice and considerable vocal talent. She ,* m v was called upon to repeat the last movement. Thcsamocoin-" ®plimentwxs paidtoMr. Harrison in the once popular ballad, from Mr. Balfe’a daughter of St. Mark, “We may be happy I A i yet,” which he sang in his best manner. Besides then» Miss Thlrlwal], a young and promising singer, gave Battl liatti" (accompanied on the violoncello by Mr. Collins); and Mr. Ferdinand Glover (of tlie

Last night the concert was of » more generally “ popular” character, and the hr ¡ft appearance of Miss Louisa Tynej Jiff gave an interest to the vocal deportment which waa previously watting. A selection from Mr. Haifa's Ro.u oft| f ¡4 CttAWe was a prominent feature in the first part. ; jU| Miss Tyne Introduced two songs belonging to the r 8 personsge she represents in that opera, which are strongly opposed in character to each other—via,, the ballad of "The Convent Cell ” and the grand air, “At last I’m Sovereign here “—the first of whioh displays her expression and the lest her command of florid execution to the higheet advantage. How admirably she gives these well-contrasted pieces it is unnecessary to say, since the great majority of oor theatrical and musical readers hare no donbt seen and heard Tht Rott of OaiWle at the , Lyceum Theatre. Suffice it, Miss Tyne was received in a i wi most enthusiastic manner, and the audience only refrained from insisting on a repetition of “The Convent Ceil” in consideration of her recent indisposition—the fart and the cause of which wern pretty generally known. With Mr. Harrison they were less chary ; and this gentleman was compelled to sing, "] am a Simple Muleteer“ and “'Twas liank and Tame’ (the last one of the happiest imitations of Mr. Bunn’s lyrical manner

a duet betvseen the Misses Tyne, tlie trio, “Wine, wine," for Messrs. St. Albyn, Honey, and Weiss, and two other ,^*<8 duets were included in the selection from Mr. Balfo’s admired opera, whioh appeared to afford unqualified satisfaction.
Theic were only two strictly “ classical'' pieces in the 1 programme Beethoven’s overture to Fidtrn (capitally fl

same calibre. M. Moscbelee—tl.migh bis pianoforte uiusio i tf has of late years been thrown into the shade by tho towering genius of Mendelssohn (to say nothing of the . . , temporary voge- of an inferior .whool) is not the ¡5 I I leas one of those who hare roost directly influenced tho progress of the instrument. His compositions, next to -m those of Hummel, stand closest in relation to those of the w acknowledged great masters ; and the fourtii oonccrto (hi tlielast movement of whioh the ErU -sA Orcnadurn’ March is treated, with great felicity, es principal theme) is one of the boat and most olfcotivo of them all. Tow contemporary pianists will take the pains to master these works, which are too elaborate and difficult to be performed without zealous and assiduous preparation. But Miss Arabella Goddard, a thorough ccleetio in music, has evidently the mania for revivals, and not only brings forward the least familiar production* of great luminaries of tlie art, but frequently avails herself of the tidera minora, >’ Ji ; j as if to exhibit the fertility of her resources. Even Mosart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn stand in need of occasional repose ; while the pianoforte music of Handel :	'
and Baoh is for the most part only addressed to special audiences. Such composers as Hummel and M. ** j, Moeclicles, who have approached bo near to tho highest * standard, should therefore not l>e neglected Of the eight oonoertos published by M. Mosoliele* tho fourth is, perhaps, the most brilliant; and for such an audience as that which assembles in Drury-lane Theatre during Tassion week it was the most judicious choice that could have been made. Its sueocts was complete.
Miss Goddard played the entire piece with a spirit of brillianoy and refinement not to ba surpassed, and the audience were enchanted. Tho Jankma on the prayer, toranttlla, sleep song, and march in ifatumtl'o—one of M. Thalbcrg’s most ingenious compilations, over- * .a eg laid with intricate mechanical contrivances and bristling ** with diffioulticM -was her second display ; and, though far less to be esteemed from a purely musical point of view than the conoerto, was equally well received and »Bolted the compliment of a recall for the performer.
In the second part, among other thing*. Mr. 'Weiss sang his own ballad, ” When we were boys together,’’ with so . g much taste and feeling as to obtain a unanimous “encore," and Miss Busan Tyne gained much and well-deserved applause in an air from the Huffvtnott of Meyerbeer.	*

The English Public, appreciating Operatic Music, are generally debarred from its enjoyment by prices which prudence rejects. The iManager believes it essential to a popular Opera, that while its ¡Artistes must be of undoubted talent, the Works performed of the [highest order, and the execution as complete as possible, it should |be not less available to the Public, at a charge so moderate as to |eome within the means of all classes. Upon the support of those Fho have hitherto been debarred from such an amusement, he specially relies, and he is not the less confident of being able to deserve the patronage of the Aristocratic and Wealthy.

The Italian Opera “ for tho people,” at Drury-lane Theatre, appears to flourish, at lea«t if crowded houses may be accepted as a test. The Troratore, the Traviata, and the Sonrumbvla have been successively presented. We jr may state, in a line, that the attraction of the last is the Amina of Madame (dossier, whose original and extraordinary ' VS feats of vocalisation an reoeived with overwhelming P e applause, and who, in "Ah non giungc,” throws down the gauntlet to all contemporary singers hy
I. touohing (juit touohing) one note higher ihan the ^ Highest Moiart wrote foT tho exceptionally gifted lady to I whom ho dedicated the part of the “ Queen of Night,’» ) in Die Zauberfiotc. To be plain, Madame Gassier, in one . passage of the rondo, ascends as high as “double G,’’ • f1 where, however, for the present we are compelled to leave
-__j her. Elvlno is undertaken by Mr. Perron, a well known
concert singer, who has a pleasing voice, and whose per-gt formanco, however unequal, exhibits many eommend-A able points. The part of Count Kodolpho is entrusted rto Signor DlnelU. If really, as the bills assert, "from the principal thoatres of Italy,” this gentleman may be taken as presumptive evidence that the principal theatres of Italy are greatly In want of barytone*. In
I he Trovatore and Traviata Madame Halvini Donatelli and Signor Badloll, neither unknown to fame, have made their fire* appearance in England. The Trovatore we have not yet seen; but the Traviata was, on the whole, a ]wrform-anoo amply worth double the money paid to witness it. The opera is remarkably well "put upon the stage,” and, what is of still more consequence, the music (although the band and chorus, ably directed by Bignor Vianesi, might, be a »hade better) Is uncommonly well executed by the “principals.” Madame Baivini Donatelli will be remembered in mnsloal annals, if only on one account. The notorious character of Violetta was composed expressly for her by Signor Verdi, and she was its earliest representative in Italy.	The opera failed, it is true; hut that was laid
to tho account of tho other ungere, Madame Donatelli having no hand in the disaster. The lady is still in her prime, and though her acting is hardly fascinating it ’« full of intelligenoo, while, on tho other hand, much of her singing is cl a high class. In the cavatina at the end of Act 1, mare especially in the brilliant last move-
II mont, Madame Donstdll evinces an animation and J fluency ,t delivery often wanting in yooallats of higher renown. Signor Badlali, whoso artistic career 'l(|j«ha»! been divided, betwoen his own country and M the United States of America, is also an artist i>f distinction-Ills exterior is nut prepossessing ; but his noting is earnest
and impassioned, and he does more with the somewhat prosy
El
I
I
_ muslo of Hie elder Clermont than any representative of the part with whom we have hitherto been made acquainted. Mr, Charles Braham, as Alfredo, shown a marked improvement, not only in bis singing generally, but in his stage deportment. He occasionally forces his voice, which further experience will show not only to bo unnecessary, but unadvlsablo, since, while It deteriorates from its really fine quality, it does not asid to Its volume. When Mr. Braham sings without effort ho invariably creates a good (impression. He possesses the instinct of phrasing, (and should endeavour always to produce his voice as naturally as when not aiming at particular effects. In many parts of the Traviata his singing 1 M is excellent, and, to judge from the applause ho receives, gH ho is a favourite with the audience. The mbordinate part | of Flora is filled efficiently hy Madame Bellosio (late of the I Opera Buffa, in St. James’s Theatre.) AU things regarded, I this cheap Italian opera is worth enoouragoment; and we tj have only to add that, considering there art already two V Italian operas on a largo scale established in tho metropolis, we wish tho Drury lano company were an English one.

RIGOLETTO, nominally the jester of the libertine Duke of Mantua, is in truth his pander, and, among his other misdeeds, assists his master in the «eduction of the wife of Count Ceprano. This naturally excites the anger of the Count and his Followers, and they fermine to visit Rigoletto with vengeance. Another noble of the Court, Count aterone, has also had his honour assailed through Rigoletto, and, in an interview with Duke and his minion, invokes the vengeance of Heaven on the heads of both of them ach appalling earnestness, that Rigoletto ever afterwards reverts to the malediction in tay, and with an inward conviction that it will one day be fulfilled. The unwavering ♦fcroyer of other men’s domestic peace has a daughter of his own, named Gilda, on whose purity ; doats. So rigidly has he guarded and concealed her, not allowing her ever to leave his house except to attend her religious observances on the Sabbath, that her existence even was hardly known to any but himselt. But] the quick obseiwation of the libertine Duke had discovered the maiden at her devotions, and, under pretence of being a poor student, he had won her affections, and traced her to her dwelling. From this, the residence of her father, Ceprano and his Followers, supposing her to be Rigoletto’s mistress, undertake to iear her by force; and, by pretending that it is Ceprano’s wife—whose house adjoins—-that BORCHARD^ they are thus about to abduct, they make Rigoletto an instrument in the ravishment of his
Mad»«- FUMAGALLI
(Her 1st Appearance)
own daughter, whom they convey to the palace of the Duke. Enraged to madness, when he discovers the trick that has been practised on him, he hires a bravo, named Sparafucile, to assassinate the Duke; and the latter, aided by the blandishments of his sister, allures the Duke to a dilapidated inn, of which he is the host, intending there to fulfil his compact, and to cast the body into a river that runs by. But the Duke’s easy and fascinating manners so win upon Madelena, the sister, that she becomes desirous of saving him. Rigoletto has desired his daughter to disguise herself in male attire, and thus to effect her esc ape to Yerona; but, before departing, he brings her to the neighbourhood of the inn, that she may learn the Duke s faithlessness from occular observation. While thus outside the .inn, she hears an altercation between Sparafucile and Madalena, relative to the c ontemplated murder of the Duke, and a declaration by the former that he will assuredly VI ANES)ISsaS8inate ^im UT1^ess some oru' shall happen to come by whom he could substitute tor him, _______________*0 as to get from Rigoletto the promised reward.

Signor Naudin, too (the “ celc #V)3k Ji brated tenor from Parma, Ac.”), would be at least passable in the links, if lie were less solicitous of making strong “ points” and contrasts; but somoofflcialin authority should carefully remove tiie chair in the last soeno, when the Parmesan “virtuoso” abandons himself to the aspersion of the fair sex, in “ I,a donna a mobile,” that article of domestic furniture seemingly exercising a nervous attraction from which he is unablo to disembarrass himself, aud which deteriorates from the effect of the popular melody in question Signor Mattiol! is wholly inefficient as Kigoletto, both vocally and drama g.,- tically.	With a good voioe, he does not know how
™ * 1 to use it ; with by no means an ineffective presence, his stage deportment is nngainly and awkward, and with ample physical resources his acting is extravagant without being in the least forcible. The Trouatcm seems one of the most attractive works in tile repertory of the ‘‘Italian Opera for the People.” Obeouro as are th« incidents of this pronlous masterpiece, iiisorutable the motives of on.- and all the personages, and hyperraelodramtti. tally horrible it* catantrnpho, the “cheap” audience appear to relish it, and with equal vehemence and unanimity applaud Madame Halvinl TldnatolH, whether admiring the stillness of the night, swearing fidelity to her lover, disdaining the suit of his traitorous kinsman, or as. Bcrting the sincerity of her devotion by swallowing a dose of poison, ooeore Mr. Chari«, liraham in ‘Ah si lien mio,’’ and pay • like compliment to Signor Badiali, in “ II balen del sqO storiso ”• as if they knew the signification of the wordb, and could make out the rhythm of the air- which latter by the way is a task beyond the capabilities of many a professed connoiseur. .Seriously, for the sake of art, for the sake of osndoitt, and for the sake of oomrnon sense, w” lihooM like to 8imI the Santo amount of enthusiasm liestowod ‘ 'oroifreetfy within the comprehension of matters progress in this way, Mossrs Jtebson, to avoid “going to the bad,”

At the Drury lane Italia» Open tBo appoarance ol Madame Persiani, as Klvir* in the Puritani -which, own In hei best day, wm never one of her most successful impcr. sonations—somewhat disappointed the admirers of that (accomplished vooalist, who hoped to eee her in Lucia, Amina, or one of those characters in which sho was , wont to he so justly celebrated. Nevertheless, in ,	| apite of inevitable shortcomings, there wore many
| tilings in liar performance to praise without qualification | i - and especially in the mad scene, whore Madame Persian! raki ornamented “ Qui la vooo” in tliat profuse and elaborate style for her command of which sho wm, in a great measure, indebted for her renown. The audience reoolved her with an»,, enthusiasm, and applandod everything she did, good, bad, or indifferent—her astonishing flexibility, her genius for embellishment, for whioh she was always famous» ur, and that uncertainty of intonation, which, by no Wi means decreases as time jogs on, being awarded J the same amount of consideration and confounded in one indiscriminate vsrdiot of approval. The polaoca, “ Son vergine vessosa,’- though by no means the lady’s - most finished achievement, especially elicited tho most 1 uproarious approbation from the Drory-lane aadienoe. - Signor Badiali was Ricoardc, and gave fresh proofs of hi» J ability both as actor and singer. On the other hand, Signer Naudin’s Arturo was more original than sympathlo ; while the Giorgio of Signor Manfredi was doff f oidedly mediocre. Nevertheless, the ever-green duct % wa for basses, ending with " Snoni la tromba”—vocl-feraterl with strenuous resolution by the two gentlemen , who impersonated IUecardo and Giorgio—was rewarded by i'f I obstreperous demonstrations of delight, end may be recorded “as the cnlninoting point of triumph. Tho Puritani was repeated on Saturday night. This evening we are pro-
amisod the SonnamMa, with Madame Viardot as Amina, and Signor Naiulin as P.ivino; to-morrow the ibwitoni for the third time; and on 'Wednesday Norma, for Madame Viardot and Mr. Charles Brahaan. Miianwhilo t, Von Giovanni is in preparation- the cast to include, as wo " * are informed, the whole strength of the company. The report of Signor Tamburlni having acoeptcd an engagement is, wenndoretand, unfounded. As reasonably almost might Signor Donselll be invited to play Ottavio and Madame . Pasta Donna Anna.

fin-nflee Ope« (NGllereR till Niue under the direction of Ir. B. CMAiriKTII«
In tills Opera* a love story Is grafted on the warfare between the Royalists and the Puritans In the time of the fttnarts, The principal Incidents are supposed to tike place In a Fortress in the neighbourhood of Plymouth, or which Lord Walter Walton is the Governor-General, lie has a brotlier, Mr George,
S Colonel on half-pay, and a Daughter* Klvira. All these are of the Puritan party) and Lord Walton Is desirous of bestowing the hand of Rlvira on Sir Richard Forth, also n Puritan, and a Colonel in the army, lint Flvira's affection* have been won by n partisan of the Btuarts, Lord Arthur Talbot, and through the Intereesslon of her unele» air George, her father is induced to forego his own preference fbr air Richard, and to consent to her marriage w ith Lord Arthur* There Is another Important personage in the drama, a lady who is a semi-prisoner at the Fly mouth fortress, being suspected as an adherent of the i atunrts I and not without very good reason, for she Is no less a personage than Henrietta of France, the widow of Charles L, who has thus sought concealment and security, under the name of Madame Villa Forte,
v	j	.
At the rise of the curtain, soldiers are dissevered on the ramparts oi the for. tress, relieving guard, and singing their matins as the day dawns. In subse* guent scenes we find Mir Richard Forth bewailing the loss of Bh irn, and vowing vengeance against his apparently more successful rival; and the uncle of the lady announcing to her the success of his Intercession with her father in favor of the lord oi her afTectlons, Preparations are accordingly made for the nuptials t a procession or Fsqnlres, Pages, and Damsels, arrives, with suitable presents) amongst which Is amagnlftcent w hite veil. While this Is going on Lord Walton has received instructions from the Parliament to arrest Henrietta and send her prisoner to London, He charges his soldiers to Keep steadfast watch over her* and places the order for her arrest in the hands of Lord Arthur, the pledged adherent of her cause! In the meantime, the wedding arrangements are completed, and Hlvira re-enters, attired for the ceremony « but, bearing the nuptial veil In her hand, she playfully thrown it over Henrietta, remarking that»—* With this veil o*er thy beauties Mow ing, tfaon*lt seem the chosen bride, |Othe altar going.* Arthur Is struck with the sudden Idea) aud when, after lBIvlra has retired* Henrietta attempts to remove the veil, he conjures her to desist t tor* 'thus attired, tho vigilant guard thou'lt baffle, who’ll take thee far the bridet* Ho then somewhat forcibly leads her off, and Rlvlra re-enters with the bridal party, just in time to see them pass the drawbridge. Of course, this abrupt departure can bear no other construction than an elopement. Klvira becomes motionless In astonishment and despair; with a fixed stare she raise her hand to her distracted head, and it is discovered that the sudden shock has «riven her mad t
Little oow remains to he told* The Second Act is occupied almost wholly With the mad scenes of the heroine j but n hint Is given that her reason may be restore« by some joyous emotion ns sudden as that which had occasioned the malady. The Parliament* on being informed of the «scape of Henrietta, eonfis* rated the estates of Lord Walton* but afterwards restored them to him, in the conviction that he had not knowingly been a participator in the escape.

In this Opera* a love story Is grafted on the warfare between the Royalists and the Puritans In the time or the Stuarts. The principal Incidents are supposed to take place In a Portress In the neighbourhood of Plymouth, of which Lord Walter Walton Is the Governor-General* He has a brother* Sir George« a Colonel on half-pay* and a Daughter. Elvira* All these are of the Puritan party I and Lord Walton Is desirous of bestowing the hand of Elvira on Sir Richard Forth* also a Puritan* and a Colonel in the army. But Elvira's a flections have been won by a partisan of the Stuarts* Lord Arthur Talbot* and through the Intercession of her uncle* Sir George, her father is Induced to forego his own preference for Sir Richard* and to consent to her marriage with Lord Arthur. There Is another important personage in the drama* a lady who is a semi-prisoner at the Plymouth fortress* being suspected as an adherent of the Stuarts s and not without very good reason* for she is no less a personage than Henrietta of France* the widow of Charles 1.« who has thus sought concealment and security* under the name of Madame V illa Forte.

At the rise of the curtain* soldiers are discovered on the ramparts ot the for. tress* relieving guard* and singing their matins as the day dawns. In subse. qnent scenes we find Sir Bichard Forth bewailing the loss of Elvira, and vowing vengeance against his apparently more successful rival; and the uncle of the Indy announcing to her the success of his Intercession with her father In favor of the lord of her affections. Preparations are accordingly made for the nuptials t a procession of Esquires, Page«, and Damsels* arrives* with suitable presentst amongst which Is a magnificent w hite veil. While this Is going on Lord Walton has received instructions from the Parliament to arrest Henrietta and send her prisoner to London. He charges his soldiers to keep steadfast watch over her* and places the order for her arrest In the hands of Lord Arthur* the pledged adherent of her cause! In the meantime, the wedding arrangements are completed* and Elvira re-enters, attired for the ceremony; but, bearing the nuptial veil In her hand, she playfully throws it over Henrietta, remarking that*—* With this veil o'er thy beauties flowing, thou'lt seem the chosen bride* |0the altar going.' Arthur Is struck with the sudden Idea; and when, after Elvira has retired, Henrietta attempts to remove the veil* he conjures her to deslstl for, ‘thus attired, the vigilant guard thou'lt baffle, who'll take thee for the bride!* He then somewhat forcibly leads her off, and Elvira re-enters with the bridal party, just In time to see them pass the drawbridge. Of course, this abrupt departure can bear no other construction than an elopement. Elvira becomes motionless In astonishment and despair; with a Axed stare she raised her hand to her distracted head, and It Is discovered that the sudden shock has driven her madt

Little now remains to be told* 1 he Second Act Is occupied almost wholly with the mad scenes of the heroine ; but a hint Is given that her reason may be restored by some joyous emotion as sudden as that which had occasioned the malady. The Parliament, on being informed of the escape of Henrietta* con As-rated the estates of Lord Walton* but afterwards restored them to him. in the conviction that he had not knowingly been a participator in the escape. Lord Arthur, however* was condemned to death* and large rewards were offered for Ills capture. Hunted by the soldiers or Cromwell* the luckless knight nevertheless gets access to his beloved, when he for the Arst time becomes cognisant ol her sad condition, and the cause of it.

The plot of ‘ H Trovatore ’ is very romantic ; but it has the merit of being connected and intelligible. The mother of Azucena, an old gipsy, has been burned as a witch by the father of the Conte di Luna; and Azucena, in revenge of her mother’s death, steals the younger brother of the Count, and brings him up as her son, under the name of Manrico. He becomes a troubadour, and gains the love of Leonora, who is also beloved by the Count. The first act shows Manrico and the Count in pursuit of Leonora ; and it ends with a challenge and a duel. In the second act, the gipsies are introduced-Manrico being wounded. He learns that Leonora is about to take the veil; and in the convent the rivals again meet, Manrico’s followers overcoming those of the Count, and Manrico bearing off Leonora. In the third act the lovers are about to be united ; but Manrico learns that Azucena is in the power of the Count, and condemned to be burned ; and in his attempt to release her he is himself captured. The last act shows Leonora offering to marry the Count, as the condition of Manrico’s freedom, but poisoning herself to prevent the Count’s possession of her. The Count sends Manrico to the scaffold ; and only after the death-blow has been struck does he learn from Azucena that he has sacrificed his long-lost brother.	.	,,

DON PASQDALE was originally one of a series of Operas written by MM. Alphonse Royer and Gustavus Vaez, expressly for the Theatre de la Renaissance. As far as excellence of plot, artistical keeping and skilful dramatic treatment go, it is infinitely superior to the general class of Opera BufFa.
Don Pasquale, from Cometto, in the Roman States, a rich, credulous, saving, but withal good-hearted old bachelor, has determined to disinherit his nephew (Ernesto), on account of the latter declining the hand of a wealthy lady whom he wished him to marry. This refusal is owing to Ernesto’s attachment to a young widow (Norina) of very limited fortune. In furtherance of his scheme for disinheriting his nephew, the Don resolves to settle himself in marriage : accordingly, he consults his friend (Dr. Malatesta). a physician, and a very pleasant man; but Dr Malatesta, couviuueU of the absurdity of such a resolution, and aware of the ruin that would ensue to Ernesto, proposes his own sister as a suitable match for the Don, and, his assent obtained, introduces Norina—whom Don Pasquale had never seen, as the sister, just arrived from a convent.
Norina’s modest looks, diffidence, & extreme simplicity, adorned by the most enchanting beauty, strike the old man with admiration, and he requires the immediate consummation of his happiness. Drs Malatesta has taken the precaution to procure a fictitious Notary, his own nephew, who is to perform a aham marriage ceremony. In the meantime, Ernesto arrives to take leave of Don Pasquale, before his voluntary exile from home, where all his hopes had been blighted, but is thunderstruck on finding his beloved Norina on the point of forming a union with his uncle. Dr. Malatesta briefly acquaints him with his plans, and Norina’s arrangements, and he is made to sign as a witness to the contract. No sooner have the nuptials been celebrated, than Norina commences a scene of extravagance, to the great astonishment of Don Pasquale, with whom order and economy are the leading rules of conduct. She increases her establishment extravagantly, orders new furniture, carriages and horses; and to her husbanas remonstances at such heedless profusion, she expresses her unchangeable determination, and recommends him to go to bed, while she prepares herself to visit the theatre with Ernesto. As a climax, a letter which Norina has dropped and Don Pasquale has
gcked up, discloses an appointment given by the bride to a gallant.
on Pasquaie’s fury has now reached its climax; he wishes to be revenged, and, to surprise his faithless consort, he proposes to Dr. Malatesta to accompany him to the garden where the amorous couple are to meet. Sick and digusted at his short specimen of matrimonial felicity, Dr. Malatesta explains the deceit which had been practised upon him ; and Don Pasquale joyfully unitas Ernesto and Norina’s hands, vowing to renounce matrimony for ever.

At Druqr-lane Mr. E. T. Smith is carrying on hi* enter, prise with hi* accustomed spirit. Madame Viardot Garcia has appeared as Amina in the Sonnambula, and Madame Pcrsiani u Norina in Don Paaquale. Onr criticism of Madame Viardot’s Korina applies with oqoal trnth to her Amina, which is no lees distinguished bp prodigious vocal skill and exoetsive histrionic elaboration. It Is superfluous to talk of this lad Vs voioe, for such it her musical art, such her executive proficiency, that she never leaves one time to think about it. Her “ Come per me sereno” end “ Ah non ginnge” were just ae remarkable as her “ Una voee pooo fa,” hut recentl-noticed, and created the same amount of enthusiasm, the last being rodemanded with acclamations. Signoc Naudln wa* better suited in the nmsioof Klvino than in that of the Duke of Mantua, and in a (p eat measure deserved the boisterous encore awarded to the slow movement, “ Tutto i soiolto.” If this gentleman would force his voioe lees frequently and make fewerofforts to be strenuous and emphatic , ha would sing ns well again. A a an actor ve fear his cas,, is hopeless. The Rodolfo of Signor MatttoH was mediocre at tho beet, the Lisa of Mademoiselle Bellosio more ambl* Mens than artistic. Tho general execution of that light and sparkling opera, fi Don PatquaD- Donisetti’s seoond best ' in the buffo style—was much more even and satisfactory than that of La Sonnambula. But then we had for Dr. Malatesta Signor Badiali, who should long ago, by right of merit, have occupied a position at one of our great Italian theatres,’ instead of being allowed to waste his prima on the other side of the Atlantic ; and for Don Pasquale there was Signor Rovere, a favourite in the early days of the Covert Carden opera, who, though Us humour he dry, is quite up in all the “ traditions” of tbe part, which he impersonates with diverting qualntcase. Signor liadiall’s singing was admirably artistic throughout, and the scenes between the scheming doctor and his amorous patient produced a marked effect. Signer Naudio's Ernesto was rigid and ungainly; nevertheless, in the popular serenade ‘‘Com’ e gentil,” ho was moored with one of thoae uproars peculiar to the audience« who attend these performances, for whose musical taste, if they would display a less ardour and a little more discrimination, we should entertain a still devouter respect. “ Palmam qui meruit’’ is not one of their mottoes, since they arc disposed to crown every one with bays when the humour is on them. Otherwise they might observe the distinction between such singing as Signor Nandln’s —singing of the Btantorcan school—and that of Madame Persian!, who, compelled as she is at this epoch to husband her means and now and then timidly invoke the muse of song, exhibits at intervals a brilliancy of execution, combined with finished neatness and hreadth of phrasing, that few of her cotempo lanes have equalled, fewer surpassed. Madame Persia»'' may not be what she was. How, indeed, is that possible ? But what she it, even now, might often serve tor a lesson to more than one in the senith of fame and the full wnunand of resources. Many passages in the duet with Dr. Malatnsta were inimitable ; others in the course of tho opera were equally perfeot; while nothing could be more natural and telling than her acting throughout. But surely the original ending of the opera is preferable to the polka from Bignor Alary’s Trt Hottu, which, though agreeable enough In its plaoe, is wholly out of place by the side of Dmiisotti’» genuine comic music. Don Par quale, ltfce La Sonnamhtja, was i triumphant success ; and it may|bn as well to add here that at the Drury I jane Italian Opera the word “ tatce," pure Italian though it he, is nn known. The public don’t recognise, the-eingors would repn. dints, and Mr. B, T. Smith ignores it altogether.

TUB erfginai warce of the vari mm	« whence the following piece ts derived*
is traced to a tradition In Spain of a dl ssolntc viohlemm, sneh as the character of Bon Juan represents; and ft wonld he a difficult task to name any snhjret that h** so often been chosen for theatrical rep presentation, and has been so popniat In every part of Knrope, as the story of till < vlclom profligate.
It was first tntrodneed «ponthesta gens a comedy, under the title of “K1 Burlador de Sevilla, y Comhfdado de Pie dra,’ (the Joker of Seville, and the finest of Stone,) by Gabriel Telle«, of Hndr)d, t he author of many dramatic works* It was soso transited Into Italian by Cicogni ai, and also by filtlhcrto; and performed with so much success in this language, n ot only In Italy, bn* even In Paris, that Moliere, being strongly solicited by his e ompany of comedians to write an imitation of It, produced “ Le Festín de Pierre, ” n comedy In fire acto, in prose, which which was first represented in the year lfififi. This piece was shortly after put into verse by T. Corneille, who added two scenes, and thus It has been performed on the French stage ever since.
In 1690,8 had well, the poet-laureate, introduced the smbject into this eoaatry In his tragedy, “ The libertine;” bat made bin hero so wantonly and undoubtedly wicked, and the whole piece, though written with vigour, Is so crowded with Incidents and loaded with extravagances, that if was soon laid aside, and Is now
forgotten.	1	'	...	• /:	.
A boat the middle of the last century, Goldoni added one more to the list of dramas foaaded oa the history of the same liceatioas Spanish grandee* It is railed * Bon Giovanni Tenorio, o sin, 11 IMsscIhIo. ’ In the preface to this comedy, he names Calderon della Barca as the aathor of the original piece; hat he seems to he supported la his assertion by no authority, wlillnt all other testimonies coacar in ascribing it to Telle«. Most probably Goldie«! was misled by the disgnisrd name under which the comedy is printed in the Spanish editions*
The Italian opera, in its present state, was written and adapted for musical representation by Lore»«« da Ponte, who was engaged for some time In Vienna, and afterwards in London, in the poetical depa rtment of filie Italian Theatre, le arranged other opera* for Mozart; and has, perhaps, succeeded as well as can he expected, if th* disunities which a lyric poet has to encounter ar duty weighed, in forming an estimate of his ability. £
MOZART composed the opera for the theatre at Prague; and it was performed in that df>% for the first time, in 1787. ibis refined and intellect«»! music was not thoroughly understood at that period, even in Germany—a circumstance which Mozart may have anticipated: for. previously to its first representation, he remarked to a Mend-“ This opera is oat calculated for the people of Vienna; it will be more justly appreciated at Prague ? but, in reality,! have written it principally io please myself and my Mends.” Ilia compositions, at once elaborate an i beautiful, had not made much more progress several years afterwards ? for “Le ftozze di Filtro.” which now attracts wherever performed, was given at Paris* in 1W4, wtth wry lliile effect! and when “ »0* Giovanni*’ was first predmeed atthe icaiemie de Musiese, it» character wat te Imperfectly comprehended, both •* the stage Md ta the orchestra, that fiarat, the celebrated «tiger, observed—'1 »oa

Azucona, which can hardly have been forgotten by tho patrons of the Royal Italian Opera. Mr. Charles Braham played Manrico, apart which he has filled with spirit since the commencement of the present undertaking. Lumzia Btrrgia was the means by bringing before the public for the first time a young lady, apparently an Englishwoman, hot announced in the bUls as u Mademoiselle Vaneri,’’ We can hardly recall a more successful probationary effort. Mademoiselle Vaneri is, of course, inexperienced ; but she has extreme youth, a fine voice, and great constitutional energy in her favour. AM she has to do at present is to pursue her studios uninfluenced by the indulgent enthusiasm of her friends and the public generally on an occasion so trying and important to herself. If she oan cflfeot this there is every ohanoo of her speedily becoming an artist; if not she may have a longer time to wait. Mr. Charles Braham (Gennaro) introduced an air from Moroadante’s tfiuranvnlo, which was much applauded. 81gnor Manfredi woa the Duke, and Mademoiselle Poma (oncored in the JSrinrliti)
Maffco Orsiui. On Saturday the entertainments (for the benefit of Mr. E. T. Smith) consisted of Don Qiovvrmi (first J time) and the musical farce of The Waterman. An efficient performance of Don CHomnni with such an orchestra and chorus as Signor Vianesi has vainly endeavoured to control daring the season was, we need hardly say, out of the question. There were, however, some fine points. Madame Viardot’s highly intellectual Impersonation of Donna Anna ; Madame Persiani’s ZerlLia, *> neatly acted and the music generally so well sung as to atone in some measure for the trivial turns and “orna*
JL?tH masts” with which she disfigured the principal songs, andSignorRovere’s dry but admirahlyjartistio Leporello were worthy of figuring upon any stage. Signor Manfrcdi’s Commendatore, too, w«a good. On the other hand, Signor Madloli, whom we have found reason to eulogise in every other part ho has attenqited at I)rury-lano Theatre, by no means realised what was expected of his Don Giovanni, which was, for the most pari, (although musicaMy correct! heavy and spiritless. The Elvira of Mademoiselle 8ed’ latsek was mediocre at the best; Herr Kinni’a M* eetto to deplorable, and Signor N audin’s Ottavio tho worst we oan remember. Snob a version of " II nuo tesoro” as the last-named gentleman gave altogether surpassed belief. Nearly oil tho concerted music © if ik	If l » was executed In a aloveuty manner, and especially the raag-
-	»•* <*• nlfloentsestet, “Sola, sola,” which was tho more provoking
rinoe Madame Viardot, Madame Persiani, and Signor Rover* were concerned,and of course sang their parts correctly, Nevor-thi less tho opera was reoeivod with tnmultaous plaudits; there were several encores, and at the fall of the curtain Mr.
Smith was unanimously summoned. The spesoh that . euaued was rather noted for a sort of wild eloquence than !! frill for tho plain common sense we should have anticipated from 1 the orator. Sundry topics were handled that seemed to hare s. , , , , , no logical connexion with each other. To sum up, however,
" 1	* D the sensible part of Mr. Smith’s address was to the purport
that he had speculated on Italian opera at cheap prices . that his speculation was justified, inasmuch as it had not . i||jf only been profitable to the great mass of the public but to * ’' himself; that he intended to present English opcra(the Pyne and Harrison company) before and in combination with the pantomime; and finally, that he meant to resume tho Italian performances, on an improved scale, next year. All this wa(
uproariously cheered, and the entertainments concluded with f I > •• j
the utmost spirit,—Mr. Charles Braham, as Tom Tug, ' being applauded in all his songs, and loudly encored in tho “ Bay of BiscayMr. Newoombe (manager of the Plymouth Theatre) as Robin, introducing with great effect a humorous ballad about tho Thames; and Miss fiebeooa Isaacs playing Wilhelmina and singing Annie Laurie with her accustomed vivacity. The house was literally crammed tc suffocation.

ENGLISH OPERA SEASON,
ia>e.
(JNDBR T K B MANAOBMBNT OF
MISS LOUISA PYNE
AND
M R. W. HARRISON.
In announcing the commencement of this year’s English Opera Season on the 13th of September, Mies Louisa Pyne ami Mr. W. Harrison feel called upon to address a few words to their generous patrons in explanation of their views and intentions.
Before doing so, however, they would pause for a moment to express their warmest and most heartfelt gratitude for the very liberal support bestowed upon them last year at the Lyceum; a support which has emboldened them to look forward with confidence to the result of their present un-
2
dertaking, in the much larger theatre they have now been fortunate enough to obtain ; while it has encouraged, and will encourage them to renewed exertions in the future, to endeavour to deserve a continuance of the same support.
The question of the popularity of English Opera may now be looked upon as settled. The flattering results of last season, and the continued and undiminished success which has followed the Pyne and Harrison English Opera Company ever since, throughout their long provincial tour, sufficiently prove that the British public are prepared to patronise the Opera of their native land, when placed before them in a fitting manner.
For the coming season, at Drury Lane, Miss Louisa Pyne and Mr. \V. Harrison have spared no exertions to obtain the very highest available English talent ; and they confidently trust that the result of their endeavours will enable them to present every Opera with a completeness and excellence in all respects worthy of a national undertaking.
The ambition of the present management has long been the establishment of English Opera upon a firm and permanent basis. They trust they may not be deemed presumptuous or premature in believing that—thanks to the liberal patronage already bestowed upon their endeavours —the foundation has been laid. Encouraged by this belief, they look forward to such a continuance of public favour as will enable them to rear the goodly edifice, until it reach proportions worthy of the land which it adorns.
Amongst the novelties to be produced this season the management have much pleasure in announcing a .New
3
Opera, written expressly for them by the most popular of living English composers,
M. W. BALFE,
whose “Rose op Castille,” last season, was received with such unmistakable favour, at the Lyceum, and was further honoured by being specially commanded by her Majesty for the Festival Performances in honour of the Princess Royal’s Marriage. Another triumph achieved since then by Mr. Balfe for the cause of native music, it may not be out of place to mention as a matter of congratulation—the successful production of his celebrated " Bohemian Girl,” at her Majesty’s Theatre.
The “ Rose of Casti elk," the highly flattering “ run” of which was only interrupted by the termination of the season, will be repeated with the same cast of characters as at the Lyceum, but with greatly increased orchestral, choral, and scenic effects, adapted to the enlarged facilities of Drury Lone Theatre.
An Original Opera, entitled " Rip Van Winkle,” also written expressly for the present management by an American composer,
MR. GEORGE BRISTOW,
which, though never yet performed in England, has been most enthusiastically received in the United States, will be performed in the course of the season.
Another important novelty will be the first production in English of Flotow’s Opera of “ Martha,” the great triumph of the last season at the Royal Italian Opera.
4
In addition to the novelties announced above, the repertoire of the Company includes the following favourite Operas :— “ Maritana,” « Bohemian Girl,” “ Crown Diamonds,” "Fra Diavolo,” “Daughter op the Regiment,” “ Sonnambula,” “ Trovatore,” &c.
THE DURATION OF THE SEASON WILL BE THIRTEEN WEEKS.
On the opening night, Monday, September 13th, will be performed the highly successful New and Original Opera, composed expressly for the Pyne and Harrison English Opera Company, by M. W. Balfe, entitled

The reoeption of tho popular artists was a good preparation to the stormy approval that followed everyone of their achievements, and both wore exceeded by tho lengthened plaudits and repeated “ calls” that followed the desoentof tho curtain.
In the National Anthem, one of the parts was taken by Miss Rainforth, on artist well known in the early days of Mr. Ilalfe’s operatic career, ftho was heartily welcomed, and will form one of the permanent members of tho company.
A slight but pleasing divcrtùUMtnt, in which Mesdemoiselles Michelet, Pasquale, and Morlaochl were the principal dancers, terminated the amusements of tho evening.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
** Sir,—The public owe you a deep debt f gratitude for th<> i , ^ admirable manner in which yon have, in your leading article fl ’ this morning, colled tlie attention of proprietors of theatres ■ t\ft and assembly-rooms to the necessity of providing abundant a./ttt _ means of egress from their bntldingn in the event of an * * "**'* alnrm of fire being raised. I am quite sure your spirited i A remarks upon tho fearful catastrophe in Sheffield will have *
| the effect of making every theatrical manager look to hist 1 exits and his entrances, and that wherever any improvement I can he made, increased facilities of egress will be at once* f«>| provided.	hm*m
It has long been manifest to me that the first dnty of a** «* theatrical manager (even before considering how to amuse
tg
"I
*L
8W
Theatre (before the terrible tragedy at Sheffield had been
■ «i enacted} was to see whether the facilities of rapid ogress wei e a w» sufficient for so Urge a building.
w
t We have had several interviews with Mr. Nelson, the at* I
■aa	trt r.nmmiflu'Aaf inrmrlfltfifs. nikiii f.iin miWnpf.
■ architect to tho committee of proprietors, upon the subject, and have carefully examined every passage, staircase, and
other communication which wo fonnd in nse. It was with
no slight degree of satisfaction that we discovered those
communications to he entirely fire-proof -a most important ’Ift matter to begin with—and, moreover, suflioientlv oommo
| dions to prevent any fear of the occurrence of any such „ * * fatality as that which immediately afterwards took plaoo at
i4M Sheffield.
We found, however, that certain passage*, staircase».
r doors had been for along while disnsed. Hon.» of thomfinlj ■ Mm . fact, had not been made use of for five and-twenty years. It m,* K is true that, tho existing communications seemed sufficient * »
'	* without these to meet almost any conceivable contingency. — 1'
* 1 but, determined to err, if at all, upon tho safe side, we im- ana 4fc|jj| mediately had all these extra means of egress—six in nura-,
her thrown open to the public, and now the theatre, how iJRa tl H ever densely crowded, could bessfeiy emptied in 10 minutes. vtMMk fa as 1 have thought fit to trouble you with these remarks, not "
*	U with any idea of boasting of what we have done, but in W
order to assure the public, in the event of any unnecessary *ft *a Mi alarm having been excited, that, at any rate, as far as af
*	Drury Lane is concerned, they may feel perfectly secured *■	*
ft * > against the fearful possibility of being either burnt or
I crushed to death.	_
On these grounds 1 trust yon will afford me space in your®**’ valuable columns for this letter, and oblige
Your obedient servant,

Aü Hjigfish version (b; Hr. T. H. Reyooidson) of Herr Flotow’s üfarUo w presented lut night before a crowded audience, with well merited m ornes.	Our opinion o'
the musk of this work has been giver, on more than ona occasion, and » the very excellent performance of the Drory-Iao* Oomoany afforded a» no reason to modify *t in any particular, it is unnecessary to return to the subject That so much oar« and expense should have been bestowed by the management of our only English Opera on one of the feeblest productions of modem continental art is oertamly tç bo lamented j and it is worth the consideration ot Mini Louisa Pyne and Mr. Harrison whether the solid foundation of a national lyric theatre, at which they hint with such enthusiasm in iheir prospectus, is at all likely to be advanced by the aid of exotic composers of the calibre ot Herr Flotow.
The nart ot Lady Henrietta (Martha) does not offer many favourable opportunities for the exhibition of Miss Louisa Pyne’s peculiar talent. The music is in a great measure nn-vocal, and contains few brilliant passages, Nevertheless the best that oould bo done with it was effected by this aooonr f dished artist t and as In the In ilanoe of Madame Bocio, at the Royal Italian Opera, the “hit” was achieved by the bountiful melody of “ The Lut Rose of Summer,’’ which Mise Pyne sang to perfection, winning an encore at hearty and genuine as it was unanimous. Mr. Harrison, too—the Uonel of the evening—created the liveliest impression in the same ballad that gained so many laurels for Mario-—the apostrophe to Martha, which in the English version boars the name of " She appeared clothed in light.” The character of Plunket (or Plumket), Lionel's companion, was intrusted to a Mr-J. 6. Patcy, from the provinoee, evidently a novice1 and on that account entitled to indulgence. The quality of Mr, Patey's volee is agreeable, but he is at present only on the throehold of his art. Mr. (1. Honey scarcely made so muck of Lord Tristan Miokle. ford as his performance in The Rom of CastiUc had led many to anticipât :. This gentleman is young in his profession and promis» well ; but he must not be led away by the occasionally indiscriminate applause of the galleries. Hiss Susan Pyne acted the part of Nancy to perfection, and sang the musk carefully, although it does not always lie conveniently for her moans. Another new comer, Mr. T, Grattan Kelly, as the Sheriff of Richmond, gave ample proof of inexperiemx,
The orchestra and choro*, under the able direction of Mr, Alfred Mellon, were irreproachable, every piece being exe. onted with the utmost precision, from tbo overture to the last An ale. The manner in which the opera is placed upon the stage reflects the highest credit on all eonojrned. The scenery i* capital ; while the costumes and ill the stage accessories are lavish and unexceptionable. The fair scene in Act 2, and the finale to Act 0—where Lionel and Plun. kct reooguise their truant servants in the Queen'* retinue —are just a* graphic, animated, and well managed os at the Royal Italian Opera, In short there cat be but one opinion nbont the liberal and efficient manner in which things are oondneted at this establishment ; and it is oniy to be regretted that a good English opera, instead of so poor a specimen of the German musical drama as Martha, should net have been presented to the public under such favourable auspices. The success of the Rote of CaitBte is surely a guarantee that it is not indispon sable to soour the foreign markets for novelty.
Besides the encores awarded to Hiss Louisa Pyne and Mr. Harrison, respectively, in “ The lost Rose of Summer” and “She appeared clothed in light,” the quartet at the spinning wheels,—sung and acted with great spirit by Mûmes L. and S. i’yne, Messrs. Harrison and Patey,-wss also redemandai, and repeated. The applause was warm throughout the evening, “recalls” were frequent, and bouquets in abundance. Whether Martha, however, will be a permanent attraction is, we think, questionable. That it is announced to he played on alternate nkhte with The Ron of Cattille seems to imply that Mr. Balfe's very successful opera still retains its hold upon the pnblic ; and tbit will probably be the case until the promised new work from the same indefatigable pen has made its appearance.

The production of Mx. Wallace’s Montana baa agreeably varied the repertory. No very great expense ha» been lavished. on the soenery and decorations, but as the “ en ramble” (thanks in a great measure to the orchestra and chorus, so ably directed by Mr. Alfred Mellon) re always safe at this theatre, and the executian, in consaqnenoe, pretty sore to lie efflmont, there we» little risk in allowing $ so popular am opera to stand upon its own merits, wlthoufc refiwwnee to oostly soonic aceessories. About the perform11 ^ am »" "anee not much need 1» said, thwoast of the two most ***" ““' prominent characters being the same as last winter""*“" .’H in the more confined arena o* the hycoum Theatre'
* Miss Tjouisa T’yne sings the graceful music which. Mr.
tv alls«« has allotted to Maritana with exquisite taste^ "'**'*' Of m and a brilliancy in the showy pasaagne that ooubl hardly be lul *” surpassed. Not to enter into long details, “ Scenes that r are fairest,” from the Ups of our accomplished Knglish song'> > v stress, is a treat with which amateurs of the genuine ballad 11 atyleoannot fail to bo enraptured. Mr. Harrison’s Don Cesar de Hasan, regarded from the point of view of histrionic effect, i* neither marked by the subtle humour of Frederic l<e-rnaitre nor the dashing vigour of Mr. .fames Wallaok : but
41
[ it may he safely urged, on the other side, that French and | English comedian wo.............. ’ I	*
would alike fail to raise an amount of excitement similar to that which Mr, Harrison ereato» in certain parts of the music, and more particularly in the favourite bulled, “ There is » flower that bloometb,” in which, by au artful use of the bead notes, allied to uumistakeabli.' eanrestness of expression, be contrives to win tho applause of the audience, and (as m the instance of Mis« Louisa I’yne, with the ballad already mentioned) an encore, not to accede to willed» would be dlscourleons.
The somewhat important parte of Don J«*6 and the King of Spain wilt, doubtless, far« better when Mr ire. Ferdinand |M Glover and Mr. .T. O. I’atoy — both eomparatively novioas— ■	;
tVWlh'bave anmirod more stage experience arid a greater famlli- *

to employ to advantage the resources with which nature ha» endowed them. As actors tlroy have everything to lea™. .. UI3
*8ucU a King and such a Primo Minister requite more than
ordinary forbearance on the part of the p>»blie to bo ffyffi elicwed to pass muster on the onoo obunts boards of " Old Drury.” bi liar,trills, the page, Miss Susan maws
{ I’yno exhibit« her usual intelligence, cud sings the charm -fjt ing ballad “ Alas I those chimes” (one of the gems b ’ of the opera), so well as to merit a vast deal more applause than she obtains.

DRURY-LAMM TBEATRB.
Wo can hardly believe that The Bohemian Oirl, produced last night for the first time this year, is likely to exercise any very beneficial influence cn the interests of the Drury, lane establishment. The opera was well performed ; Miss Louisa Tyne sang the mueio of Arline to perfection and was loudly encored in “I dreamt that T dwelt In marble balls;” Mr, Harrison, In Thaddeus, exhi. bited his aooustomed energy, and was foroed to repeat “ When other lips” and “ The fair land of Poland Mr* Corn, an old stager, played Devilahoof, Mr. F, Glover made his first essay in the charaoter of Arnheim, and of course was asked to sing “ The heart bowed down" twioe over. The subordinate parts were represented, with more or loss ability, by Miss Busan Pyne (Queen of the Gipsies), Miss Marian Prescott (Rada), and Mr, St. Albyn (Florestein); the band and chorus, under Mr. Alfred Mellon, were excellent; the scenery and ooetumes, although neither new nor gorgeous, quite good enough for the oooaeion ; recalls and bouquets, according to the prevailing fatihion, were lavished upon the principal singers ; and the audience (not the moat crowded of the season) appeared thoroughly satisfied with the performance. Nevertheless there was little enthusiasm, and we may reasonably conclude that The Bohemiaa Oirl has seen Its day. Whether this bo the ease or not It Is impossible to avoid the reflection that the professions entered Into gratuitously by Mias Louisa Pyne and Mr. Harrison in their prospectus are scarcely borne out by tho line of policy they have hitherto adopted. The Bohemian Oirl, though possessing attractions universally acknowledged, is not a work of such distinguished rank as to warrant its perpetual reproduction under all circumstances. The merits of Mr, Balfe, one of the most popular of our composers, no one would think of denying; but it is as well to suggest that he is not the only English musician who has written operas worthy tho attention of a management which lays claim to have founded a national ljrlo theatre upon a solid and durable basis. At all events something less hackneyed than The Bohemian Oirl might have been selected jo fall back upon in an emergenoy—more especially since the next novelty anticipated is another work from the same pen«	__________________________

The night previously Mr. St. Albyn had been placed in a similar position, and for the same reason ; bat on that oooasion he was more fortunate, and being “ well up” aa Thaddens in the Bohemian Oirl— ,T| tnbetituted st the last moment for the Trovalore- acquitted 1 •* himself to general satisfaction. Those incidents should act sa a warning to Mlsa Ixmisa Tyne and Mr. Harrison, who r#i teem to imagine that to sing for three months, night after night, without Interruption, is an ordinary matter, but, sooner or later, will be convinced of their mistake. The f Mi human voice cannot stand such wear and tear, such inoee-sant and arduous exertion
The absence of Mr. Harrison and the unavoidable inefficiency of bis substitute were in a groat measure atoned * for by tiie ringing of Miss Louisa Pync, which has rarely ‘ i been more finished, brilliant, and spontaneous. Her " oa-densa,” when Maria—impatient at the task set her by the Marchioness, and twitted by the insidious “ Rataplan1' of Snlpirio disdainfully throws down the marie and bursts rjfp into the cherished military “refrain," was a masterpleoo of elaborate Invention and executive fluency. The audience, mmmm enraptured, encored the “ Rataplan," and enthusiastically applauded Miae Louisa Pyne, the demonstration arresting the action of the piece for aconridcrablo period.

DRURY-LANE.
Not for a very long time has Old Drury sustained its Chrlatmas-holyday renown so triumphantly as on the present oocadon. The new pantomime produoed last night, before an audience as dens >ly thronged as—until the “ fun” commenced in good ean est—it was noisy, and, in the higher de* pertinents, mischievous, is beyond comparison the most at* tractive that has been witnessed for many years. In magni-fiocnoo of Bcenery, costumes, and decorations it has rarely, if ever, boon surpassed, while the materials presented by the legends appertaining to Robin Hood have enabled Mr. XL I«, Blanchard (since nearly a quarter of a century one of the chief high priests of pantomime) an opportunity of investing his introductory burlesque with a degreeof histrionic
Êrest which was almost wholly absent from Us iin-iato predecessors of 1850 and 1857. Add to whioh, mark of more than usually careful preparation was evident from the beginning to the end of the performance, and we may at once sum up by stating that for the first night of a pantomime—the cumbrous machinery indispensable to which seldom works successfully until it has become, bo to say, oiled into pliancy by the experience of repeated essays—it was unparalleled in our remembrance. Everything went glib and smoothly, as if by somo happy ohaneo—or rather ns If somo beneficent fairy (the good genius of Mr. E. T. Smith ?) had been watching over each successive scene, to avert tho possibility of aouidetit, to see that all the tricks told, that all the transformations answered “ without let or hindrance” to the signals—that harlequin's magic wand, in short, should never in any one Instance prove a mockery. Even tho musio. which, though always well selected and well arranged, as full of character as of life and bustle (Mr. 3. H. Tully, tho most practised and iluent of pantomlmio musicians, being tho composer), is seldom “ in order” at tho outset, was played by tho members of the orchestra under Mr. Tully's direction with such spirit and precision throughout that ono might have fancied the last instead of the first performance of the season was under consideration. To terminate our preamble the suooess augured from tho very opening became more and moro oortain as tho entertainment advanced, and long before tho conclusion was established beyond a doubt.
Not tho least agrteahlo incident of the evening was the shortness of tho first pieoo, whioh enabled the pantomime to begin Indore half-past 8 o'clock, and ought in roason to have secured for Mr. and Mrs.¡Barney Williams—who made their first appcaranoelnthe well-known farco of Latest from New York—a little moro decorous attention than was •Horded them. But at this particular epoch the “ gods” exhibit their oharaoteristio idiosyncrasies more emphatically than at any other, and illustrate after their manner the popularly roocivoil adage, in vino veritas. Tho pantomime is their wino ; end at the pantomime they, ns it were, “ como out,” setting tho minor courtesies altogether st defiance. And so last night they were turbulent ahd uproarious in a measure that even tho peculiar circuinstanoes oonld scarcely justify. The occupants of the pit, besides being squeezed together like herrings in a barrel, were exposed to the timo-nononrod missiles from tho upper regions, till at length somo few, less tolerant than the rest, commenced reprisals, it being easier, however, to thrown down than to throwup, theirpeiletsof orange-peel oftener than notfell short of tho mark, and tho orderly tenants of the publlo boxes wore made to suffer for the transgressions of their (in a sense of altitude) Buporiom, Thus, the pittites put another old saying into action—shooting at the pigeon and hitting tho crow.
Nevertheless, when the orchestra, after giving tho National Anthem a »1 loyal prelude, struck up the overture to tho pantomime—a capital medley, constructed on favourite airs, chiefly old English, appropriate to tho scenes about to be rovealod—attention, If not silence, was gradually obtained.
The introductory burlesque, though long, Is so good, and Offers so many excellent opportunities for scenic and de-Ooratlvo display, that it never for an instant flag*. The first •ceno, the “Hail of Harmony,” in which Music (Miss Mason —“ with songs"! summons her oourt, a just reproof is administered to tlio Traviata, and the usual common places •gainst foreigners arc launched at the representative of liallno opera, whilo our national English opera is oonsoled With a quatrain, ending as follows
“Von needn’t cine and fret, nor Vfne and Harrison"— having nothing to do with the rest, may be challenged as •nporfluotta; but tho soeno which ensues, tho “ Arcadian Haunt of the Forest Earles,” more than atones for ita comparative prolixity. Mr. Beverley has contrived few WWW tut surpass this In picturesque beauty; nor ean
pny praise do more than justice to the general stage arrangements, or to the ballet, in which some hundred ladies, costumed d fa Watteau, headed by Mademoiselles Ferro and MsJny (respectively from Turin and Paris), perform a variety’ °f dances in . style that would do no discredit; to the Italian Opera. The skilfully managed waterfall (real water) forming the background of the picture adds freshness to the whole, and so thoroughly enchanted were the audience that they not only called for Mr. Beverley, the painter, but for Mr. Smith, the manager, and applauded both with enthusiasm. Tho fairies deoide that the hero of the pantomime shall he Robin Hood —which, white it may lead to somo speculation as to tho positive connexion between Sherwood Forest and bergères à la “Watteau,” may bo passed over as one of those irrelevanoies peculiar to the nature of pantomime. Besides, the subject of SoHn Hood gives now chances to the painter for tho exhibition of his skill, while the costumes of mediaeval England succeeding those of the Louis XV. period of French luBtory, affords additional varioty and charm. During the progress of the burlesque more than one of the famous exploits of Robin Hood are embodied ; and these are enlivened by the presenoe of Maid Marian and all the memorablo associates of the bold outlaw, from Will Scarlet (a gentleman clad exclusively in red) and “Little” John (a giant of gomo 12 feet in stature) to the immortal Friar Tuck. Haring (in accordance with tho metrical legend) waylaid tho butcher in the forest, they proceed to the fair at Nottingham, where they excite the suspicion of the sheriff by oarrying off all tho prizes for the sports ami pastimes whicli our anoestors were wont to prao-tiBe on those festive occasions—as, for example, climbing the maypole, jumping in the sack, archery, tee. All this is represented on the stage with graphic minuteness and wonderful animation, net the least enlivening incident being the morris dance, into which the members of the ballet entered with just as much spirit and vigour as they had already displayed in tho foregoing scene, where the quaint Frenoh pastoral imparted such a widely different physiognomy to their evolutions. The issue of tho contest for prises in Nottingham market-place is a discovery of the identity of Robin Hood and his companions, who are forthwith ordered to be arrested by the Sh< riff, hat (or historical tradition would have lieen strangely set at nought) «.fleet the discomfiture of the enemy and their own escape with that consummate address for wliiuh poets and romancers have so frequently apostrophised them. Pursued to their haunt in the depths of Sherwood Forest, and on the point of surrendering, they are rescued by the Fairy Queen, who, witli the facility natural to lier tribe, transports, in a trice, the whole of the dramatis personal to tho “ Retreat of the Fairies in tho Region of Bluebells and Wild Flowors,” where the time-honoured “ transformation ” takes plaoe. Itohin Hood becomes Harlequin (Signor Milano), Maid Marian Columbine (Madame Buleno), tho Butcher Pantaloon (Mr. G. Tanner), and Friar Took Clown (Mr. Harry ' Bolenol ; with which merry company are speedily associated yet another Harlequin, Columbine, Pantaloon, and Clown (Messrs, St. Maine and Delovanli, Signor Pele-vanti, and Mias Brown), besides a “ Harlequina” so-oalled (Miss Lamb), Bpritcs and juvenile pantomimists (the Lauri and Delevontl families). The scene of the Fairies’ Retreat is tho pictorial triumph of the Pantomime—one of those gradually unfolded masterpieces, almost panoramic in effeot, since movement is requisite to the fulfilment of tho entire design, for which Mr. Beverley is justly celebrated, and by whioh be may be said to have originated a new school of scenic decoration. The coup d'œil was dazzling and splendid beyond description, and, amid a tempest of plaudits, Mr, Beverley, Mr. Smith, and even Mr. Roxby (stage-manager) wore suooessirely brought before the footlights.
To describe the harlequinade would oocupy a larger amount of time and space than we can devote. Baffle® it we are carried from one coinio scene to another with unflagging spirit, and that every prevalent topic of the day, from the comet and the Atlantio Telegraph to crinoline, is touched upon with more or less felicity. The Harlequins are as nimble as though they were made of nothing hut Indiaruhber ; the Columbines are engaging, and dance with grace and agility ; the Clowns do their utmost to be funny, ana succeed marvellously in getting into scrapes, and out of them again with no less felicity ; the Pantaloons bear killing and culfing with a complacency that baffles conjecture ; and the Sprites accomplish a series of fours tic fores, which having been long accustomed to, the publio have ceased to regard as miraculous. The last scone, when, their escapades over, the motley wanderers are submitted to tho application ol bine tiro and other pyrotechnie devices, regarded by experienced judges as among tho indispensable phenomena of “ fairy-land,” is worthy of the rest, and brought this entirely successful pantomime to a most effective eliniax, amid expressions of unanimous satisfaction from the audience. , ) Ly

The DRURY LANE GRAND PANTOMIME, by E. L. BLANCHARD, entlUed ROBIN HOOD ; or. Harlequin and Friar Tuck.
Scene I. The Hall of Harmony.

And then we shall see whether, as thus accompanied«
The singers keep together when I am by their side.
[Using bow as baton.
Wait for the wagging let’s have no lagging—
Wait for the wagging, and all take a guide.

There you can mix your grog with songs well known.
Admire the ringer’s pipe, and —smoke your own ;
Get beer and Bishop--tonics from " Sol-fa " k And Arne with supper, from a fair soprano.
In short, I’ve lately been in such request.
That taverns, even, won't give one bar’s rest.
Let's see, my children—where's my youngret darter T Come, Trovatora. and briug Travf- arter.

Ah I you, my babes, must both be past your prime;

I’m the Royal Italian Opera, so spacious,
Extensive, aud expensive, and capacious.

I’m nearly gone—I’ve had my share of it;
I'm gone before most people are aware of it.
But I'd bequeath, ere yet iny days grow lesser,
A little legacy for my successor:
A pantomime -and, as a sort of sequitur,
I wish that you would act as my executor.

Oh ! welcome, fairies, all around.
Pm glad to see you here.
And how are you?-and bow do you dot Yon charming all appear.
I don’t require a word.
Your looks so well reply:
And we’ll tripit, trip it, trip it, trip it,
Trip It here, presently.
Queen. Ye sylvan fairies, who, this morn of May,
In true arcadian style keep holyday ;
Ye pa-toral nymphs, who after shepherds look.
Making them prosper by a hook or crook.
Who fold their fiooks and guard them from alarms,
Or else look on and merely fold their arms ;
Tell, if you can. to wind up tbit oration,
Why you appear in Buch a situation 7 Why are you summoned hither In oommittee ?
First Fairy. I think I know - because it looks so pretty.
Queen. Come, saucy nymph, some other reason guess.
Second Fairy. Because there were strong reasons for It—
Queen.	Yes.
A shrewd surmise ; you know from our petitioners.
Of Wood i and Forests we are the real commissioners.
Our wish each forester as law receives.
And none dare axe a tree without our leaves.
But there's a Sheriff -Nottingham’s, in fact—
Who dares to threaten an enclosure act.
Upon th« borders of the forest reared I saw last night his standard had appeared.
And read in letters each an inch apiece,
“ TLi < ground to let upon a building lease."
Omnes. Shame ! Shame !
Queen.	1 knew that you would, on oooaston.
Not let him how wood for this bold invasion.
For real brioks this is the proper quarter,
But not for those accompanied by mortar.
We will not see our foresters ejected.
And R jblu Hood shall still be well protected.
[Fairies express a similar resolution, A true brave heart has he. though, in reality,
I can’t say very much for big morality ;
He's what the boys call " clever at subtraction,"
But theu he often does a generous aotion.
And ne’er forge's, when he sums up his gains,
Take from the rich you can—the poor remains.
Through him I would this Sheriff be defeating.
What say you'! shall I put it to the meeting ?
First Fairy. I think, as we are enough to form a quorum.
You had better put the motion now before ’em.
Queen. 1 move that Robin Hood be still befriended,
(There's no amendment—but his own—intended)
And that he still retains hla own dominion I Now, all of you that are of that opinion Will please to hold your legs up, and proclaim—
Your usual manner signifies the same.
[Fairies indicate their approval of the resolution la the usual Terpucho-lean style.	.	•
Carried unanimously, and thus agreed.
This meeting breaks up. and our sports proceed.
Bong. Queen.—Aif, " Voulez vou3 denser, Mademoim le."
Now let a dance say what you would tell In another way, if other Modes would not do quite as well To thoughts to rive expression.
Ere this netting I dismiss.
It will not be thought amiss,
Blaoe you all agTce, nem. dia ,

h> Ff‘t The last perform«»*« of the season, preparatory to the onmmenoetnenl of Italian opera, took place on Saturday | | night, when Mr. Tally’» pretty English operetta of William | I (imi Satan, Mr. Lennox Horne's amusing farce of Turn Betid*' \ are Better than One, and the ballet scene from the panto -J {rnime, with Mr. Beverley’s justly famous '• transformation,” J ; were presented, and heartily enjoyed by a very full house. <; i Both the merits and the dehscts of William and S««mg i become more evident on closer familiarity. What is ded- sj ; dedly good in Mr. Tully’s mosio Is comprised In those ptecosj! >: In which he has adhered to the genuine English manner. | 1 These are so attractive in themselves, and so well written, | l as to give eause for regret that the composer should, in other| ¡portions of his work, have wandered ontof hi» proper ele- ? | raent. The comic dnet for Dicky and Bella (Mr. | Manvere and Miss Huddurt); the unaccompanied trio, ? “ Hark ! the merry chimes ;’’ the song for William (Mr. 1 ¡Hatgh), with chorus, "Hurrah for old England!” the! ! hornpipe, the chorus, “ Hero’s the wind that Mows,” and i. | indeed the whole of the first finale, are not only spirited j (and excellent as music, but in perfect keeping with each 1 f other. Equal praise may he awarded to the glee with f 1 chorus, " In sixteen hundred and twenty two” (“The flying Dutchman,” which, by the way, Mr. Keynoldson should bo reminded was not a man, but a ship), and William’s song with chorus, "The Boatman of the Downs”(Aot2), a and to William's ballad, “ in the bleak mid watch” (Act 3^,
* all of which	_	_
fis difficult to reconcile three with such platitudes as the ballad, “ ’Tis spring time,” and " ’Mong high born maids,” the song of Captain Camoroa (Mr. Bosentbal), whioh are nothing hut weak parodies of Mr. Balfe. That the scene of | the court-martial would have been a failure Is hardly to * be wondered at, such a situation being quite unfit formusie Tree, Koesini, in the Oamt tadra, has treated a somewhat similar subject with extraordinary success; but it would be extremely unfair to test the short-comings of Mr. Tully by comparison with the triumphs of the greatest dramatis com poser of his age. If Mr. Tally attempts another opera in __ the same stylo he may possibly not find it disadvantageous 19 Mu, to take three brief remarks into consideration. There is merit enough in William and Susan to justify the ex* pectatinn of something still better—still more characteristic «1 jj,* and complete—from his pen.
