GUNPOWDER TREASON.
" I know no Heason,
1'ha.t QunponyAer Treason
Should ever be forgot. "-—Old English Poetry.

. This excellent Drama is founded on one of the most striking Incident, in the Annals of Great Britain: it
is taken from a Fact, certain, as it appears incredible, displaying at once, a most singular Proof both of the Strength
and Weakness of the human mind. The celebrated Gunpowder Treason was contrived at the very beginning of the
Reign cf James the First, for the Re-establishment of Popery, and were it not a Fact well known to the World.
would scarcely be credited by Posterity. In the present Drama, every striking and interesting Situation has bee,n.
introduced with strict Adherence to historical Truth; the Incident is judiciously developed, and the Language well
adapted to the distinguishing Peculiarities of the various Characters.

E. D. DAVIS begs to call the attention of the Public to the following Extract
from the Taunton Courier, April 1st, 1835.
" T h e New Manager opener] his Theatre on Wednesday last, and most effectual]) justified the expectations which hail been taiscd of that improvement which liis exarti.ns had introduced into every part of the H o u s e The panne), of the hones have been nil fleshly painted Mid decorated, the
seats newly stuffed and coveted, and perfect cleanliness pervades every pari of the interior. 'I lie good old classical drop seene. painted hi H'tmfijldc,
which, for the last tliiity years, has engaged the contemplation of the auditors in the interval; of the perform nice, has disappeaird, and an exceedingly
well-executed subject, by Mr, C H A N N I N C , has been substituted. This artist, who is one of thecompany, has, at a very inadequate notice suecesstully
displayed his talents in scenic design by producing several very clever illustrations of hit art in the va-ious new scenes which are now presented at
'his Theatre.
Of the Company in general it would be great injustice not to speak in terms of very high commendation. Its num. iicul force i ,
beyond precedent in this town j and in the ample, costly, and splendid wardrobe which the Manager has provided, there are mos' .tHind.nl materials
for all the probuhle exigencies of the provincial drama. The abilities of the Company also comprehend every interesting variety of histrionic delineation
and its vocal excellence was never surpassed in Taunton. All the pieces hitherto produced have been capitally played, among which the melo drama
has been as conspicuous as it has been admirably sustained. The farces are irresistibly provocative of mirth, und most of the character, are as well
Supported as they could possibly have been on the London beards. This assertion may appear bold, but only so lo those who have not witnessed
the singular rfcerits of this judiciously-selected corps. A rapid succession of novelties has been already witnessed, and many of thfi most popular stage
representation, will be produced wilh acelerity only slackened by the demand for a repetition of highl\ -favorite pieces. Last evening, for instance, the
Wreck Aihvc, which was played on Fridav to the great gratification of the audience, was repeated. The I'ilot—Jimnthun
Bradfmd—The
Haunted
Inn—My S'riifhbour's Wife—tVol—Good Looking Feline, and the Mutiny at the A'ure, have all been performed with a degree of skill lo command
the most decided approbation of all present. Having thus so well entitled himself to the support of the public, it is hoped thai ihe Manager will no: he
disappointed in his calculations on the liberal feelings of 'he gentry of this town.
To them it belongs lo secure to i lie public this source of
rational recreation, which, under the direction of the respectable Manager's gojd taste and malurrd experience, must inipait a happy anriiliitc to the
listlessnes of unoccupied hours—a stimulus and reward to tiie energies of daily industry, and a kindly appeal In ihe charines ol Social life, which must
always delight in witnessing the enjoyment of thiase around us. The orchestra is very ably conducted by Mr. James I'm le, the leader, under whom a
very skilful band of musicians is arranged."

This Piece ia founded on the celebrated Ballet of ' L \ SOMS \BULE,' of M. M SCRIBE and A C E R , which, on its first production
at the Theatre. In Pari., so much engro.sed the i t ..ration ol tne French Critics, Its reception in the English Metropolis has been equally
fortunate. The story of the piece is at >nce simple and ton. nine;. A yoi.nr village maiden, on the eve of her marriage, and who it (we
may say) afflicted with Somnambulism, is found in a stranger's room al midnight I — Every thing fails to convince her lover of her innocence
till he himself witnesses what he had .wore .-oii.idt'Fed a delusion.—Ernestine having retired to repose in despair for the rejection she ha*

This Drama is a talc of crime, sorrow, and remorse; the once giy Mark Redland, uow Mm l.''k the Ro'iher, and Rose Briarly, once t h e ,
pride of the village, now the Robber's wife ; her father, to retrieve a ruined fortune, had journieil to a far country, leaving his daughter in
the care of an old friend who bad promised protection , during his absence, in defiance of cliit;,, she inairied his bitterest foe. the man who had
robbed him. and who (though then she knew it not,) was an outlaw and a felon.
Murdock is the chief of a g i n g of coiners, among whom is
Sawney Macfile, whose vocation is that of a guide to decoy victims to the Fox and Goose.

EXTERIOR

OF

THE

FOX

AND

GOOSE.

Travellers arrive, conducted by Nawney, the one a stranger returning to his native village, the other, his attorney, on whom Sawney plays off
some of hi. tricks. Murdock volunteers his services to take charge of Iheir portmanteau and pistols, which they decline.

I n t e r i o r of t h e I n n .

The stranger fatigued with his ride, falls into a slumber; at this moment, Rose appears descending into the room, she cautiously approaches
to remove the pistols, and sees the portmanteau—Gracious heavens! can it be? and yet so many years have passed—she turns her eyes on the
sleeping stranger—his face is covered—with a trembling hand, she draws away the handkerchief, and discovers to her horror and amazement

THE

Will be presented the celebrated Tragedy of

Geo. Barnwell
OR,

THE LONDON

MERCHANT.

This affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation, wa, founded upon fact. The unfortunate hero of ttie piece wa<t executed for the murder of his virtuous ami venerable uncle, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; to which he wa,
mitigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned woman, step by step she led the unwary youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated a
miserable existence hy the most ignominious death.
A itorv is recorded, and the fact e.tn be proved by many living witnesses, that a yuung Gentleman of the City of London, having embezzeled
part of hi, master's properly, was providen ialy.at the representation of George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when that admirable actor Mr. Hoss
personated George Barnwell, at whose tale he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation, The Gentleman so
benefitted by this excelle.it Tragedy, was not ashamed to own his obligation to the play and performer; for at every subsequent varly benefit.
Mr. Hoss received a hundred pounds sterling, with a card to the following effect :—
"Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Baiuwel! for more than life, for his redeemed honour and
"redit, begs jour acceptance of the enclosed, which sum yon shall receive yearly as lung as you Continue in your profession. Happy am I to
acknowledge, that the stage has prevented me from ruin and disgrace; George Ham well '•topped me in my mad cart-ei. and saved me from an
ignominious death.

A CONVERT."
A celebrated and learned Divine observes, that fathers and heads of families, whose duty it is to walch over and guard the morals of the
rising generation, would do well to permit young people under their direction to be present at the performing of this excellent Tragedy, in
• hich instruction is blended with amusement.

The magnanimity of Alexina is finely displayed in resigning all her own provisions to the half-famished

THEATRE,

TAUNTON.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF

Mr. Osborne f
STAGE

MANAGER.

On Monday Evening", March 12th, 1 8 3 8 ,
Will he revived, with new Scenery, Dresses and Decorations, the celebrated Operatic Play of

Or, The Deserts

of

Si&eria

Kxamples of virtna cannot be too often brought before the public—but more particularly in a Dramatic form ; since thousands
go to the 'theatre that cither will not or cannot read ; hence » moral .te.ling npon Ihem in their amusement, is their only
chance of instruction, and in spite of all objections that fanatic, may raise, instruction, from whatever source, is a boon to the multitude.
This interesting Play is taken from Madame Cottin'sAlebrated French work, "Rliiabeth, or the Ezile of Siberia." the story, sentiments,
tint most striking situations, are closely copied from thl->riginal, which has been universally read and admired throughout Europe, and translated into almost every modern language. Were the narrative merely a creation of fancy, it would be considered as affecting a fiction as ever
met the public eye t but as it is generally known to be founded on truth, and to be actually an established fact, tenfold sympathy is naturally
excited by its dramatic representation. The Heroine of this piece was a character that reatly existed in our own times, who undertook a
painful journey of several thousand miles, over trackless snows inhospitable deserts, to throw herself at the feet of her sovereign at his coronation, and implore pardon for an honorable, but exiled father. The Emperor Alexander, whose magnanimity has since been the theme of evey
tongue, even then gave a happy and glorious presage of his character and reign, by generously granting a parent's freedom to the ardent
supplications of his duteous child, thus rewarding filial piety, and exerting the best prerogative of royally,—the power of pardon. This
transaction, so honorable to a living monarch, from motives of stage effect and propriety, is fixed at a remote period of history.
Facts are
improved by the most impressive fictiuns. The heroic character of Daran. the unwearied champion' and protector of oppressed innocence,
heightens the serious interest of the piece, while the pathetic is admirably blended with the comic, and the most animated and choice music
shell* brilliance over the whole of this varied and entertaining Drama.

T h e whole to conclude with (never

Acted hire,)

the interesting Domestic Drama, founded on fact, called

AM BRO S

INETT:P

Or, A SEA S I D E STORY.

Written by the Author of >< Black Eyed
Susan."
Thi, is one of the very best Dramas the stage has produced for some time, and has the rare merit in these translating times, of being pnrcly
' English from top to toe' The language is unaffected, forcible, and appropriate ijthe characters ar.- pleasingly drawn , the incidents follow
each other naturally and dramatically, the plot is managed with a degree of ease and skill, not usually manifested in productions of this grade.
The interest is extremely well sustained t h r o u g h o u t : pity and suspense are alternately excited, and unmixed satisfaction attends the denouement. Founded on facts, the main events of the real narrative have been preserved and heightened by the introduction of the usual dramalie
concomitants, love and jealousy, with a considerable degree of tact. Fact and fir lion mutually aid each other. The circumstances that gave birth
to the Drama, occurred in the Reign of Queen Anne. Ambrose Gwinett, the hero of the tale, was long familiar to our grandsires as the lame
beggar that swept the crossing in the almost village of 'Charing.' Being on a visit with his relations, three horsemen arrive, who arrest him
ii, the uame of the Queen, to his infinite surprise, for murder and robbery. The unfortunate man is tried, condemned, and executed. Throngh
si me strange accident, the man yet lived, his groans were heard from the gibbet, and he was relieved from his frightful situation by his master's dairy maid : he immediately took ship, went abroad, and encountered Collins, the supposed victim, who it appeared had b e e . taken
from his home by a press-gang. Ambrose, after enduring many perils, returned to his native land $ poor and a cripple, he swept the road at
Charing-Cross. Such is the rapid narrative of events, which in the present instance, have employed the dramatist

18->(J,

Will be performed an Historical Melo-Drama, called THE

OAND
S TROBBER,
L
Or, "The Innkeeper of *flhbcviUc"
The Story of"this Drama is simple, interesting our feelings lor those in humble life, strongly shewing the evil eilects daily produced by associating- with bad Company, Clauson and his Daughler,
Louise, keeping an Inn, known by the name ol "THE HLNKIK QIJARTE," having reared
and protected Ozzrand, (Osllerof the Inn,) who was cast an Orphan on their bounty. He becomes acquainted with a villain of ihe name of Dyrkill, who by wiiy means, prevails upon him
io Hob his Master, and turn to sting the breast that fostered him. The arrival of the Baron
Idenbuig and the Lady Emma, open a new scene of riches to Dyrkill, and aided by the Ostler
of the Inn, they accomplish his

iniBRlDlBID,
and cast the body into a ditch, covered wiili Brandies,—Ozzrand struck with remorse, greatly
repents, and longs to make a confession, but iswiiheld by. at first the entreaties, and then the
threats of his associate, who in a fii ol rage draws a Pis-tol and shoots the guilty Ozzrand, drags
the Ostler into a cave, seizes Louise, whose unsuspecting Father has by a strong connection of
evidence, contrived against him by Dyrkill, been arrested, tried and sentenced to death as the
murderer of Idenburg.
The tragic part of this Drama, is relieved by the drollery of Zynillo, who is placed in a
variety of comic situations The last scene presents the Soldiers about to destroy the innocent
Clauson, as the word Eire is given, the villain Dyrkdl driven in by Zyrtillo in Combat, by
chance receives the fatal Bali. Thus the virtuous are saved, and the Murderers meet the punishment their crimes so justly merit.

1833,

THE

As Commanded and Performed for the first lime Thursday, November 4th, 1830, before Hit
Most Gracious Majesty THE JKJSO, at.the Theatre-Royal,
Drury-Lane.
The Flot of tbe Piece is founded panly on the following Historical circumstances;—-* .
Alcssattdro Massaroni, the Italian Robin Hood,, was one of those daring spirits that seem to have
been created tocOfrt'ct the unequal distribution of good and evil. Chief of a lawless; Band infesting the mountains near Rome, his name spread terror throughout Italy. No place was secure from his emissaries, and so skilful were his acts of disguise that he was often made the confidante of plots laid by his enemies to entrap him. He -was a strict dispenser of moral justice i
if he made free with the rich he was (he almoner of the poor ; and never did he resort to violence but when tempting booty and stout resistance stood in his way. Like tile famous freebooter of merry England he mingled mirth with his malt-factions; and those who paid deaie>t lor
his pranks were often the first to laugh at his humour, He was a very gentlemanly Brigand full
of chivalry aud romance ; and his mode of detention and abstraction, particularly toward* tbe
Ladies, was in such good taste that they were fain to admire his gallantry, ai.d celebrate hi* exploits in their Songs. A mystery hung over his birth ! 11 is motln r was a young l'lorvntinc, who
having been seduced and deserted, had died of a broken heart, and the only fan. ly record he
possessed was her miniature, which even in the wildest moments of disorder and rapine, produced in him certain compunctious visiting* of nature that shewed be was deserving of a better
fate; such was Massaroni, nurtured by Banditti—once their Comrade,now their Chief.

Will be performed for th e first time in this Town, the admired domestic Drama, in three Act
by J . W. MONCRIEF, entitled

THE LEAR OF
Private
Ldfe;
OR

"Father and Daughter."
Who lias not wept over Mrs. OPIF.'S popular and pathetic story, "Father and Daughter.'' upon
which this piece is founded ?—It has been translated into every modern Language and dramatized at various Foreign Theatres, and has ever proved a fruitful source of interest and tears :—
to dihlcidate tbe powerful incidents which compose the ground work of the pteseht Play would
be superfluous —Suffice it to say that the comic portions form a pleasing contrast to the sombre,
they sufficiently relieve, without breaking in upon the sacred sorrow of the story, which would
have rendered rude mirth out of Place
To seasdii virtue witti the species of innoxious pleasure—to tinge tile clip of morality with the
dulcifieation of innocent enjoyment—is to perform an efficacious duty, because it is to present
to the general mind a powerful invention to the proffered precepts of goodness. And if it
should b* the interest of every stale that men should not return to their former barbarisms-tot
that rlide or relaxed state ol mind which history proves may have existed amidst the strongest
attachments tt> religion*-nothing can he more necessary, nothing more beneficial and laudable
than so ingenious, so perfect, and s6 tiuble an union of virtue and pleasure, as that which TIM';
STAGE is so capable of presenting, It exhibit, the highest examples of the loftiest qualities of
tbe heart add mind—incites while it gratifies—with the fascination of eloquence mingles the
iittelligtt.ee of precept, and incentive of persuasion, and gives heightening* to the attraction
of virtue.

MR.

CLAPTON

Most respectfully announces to the Lad its and Gentlemen of TENBUHY and its vicinity, that his
SPLENDID EXHIBITION OF

W o r k s of A r t
Which has given greater satisfaction than any other Exhibition ever witnessed, and has also been patronised by
most of the Nobility and Gentry in London, Bristol, Liverpool, Ice, is now open at the above place.
This MECHANICAL EXHIBITION comprises a grand election of PICTURESQE VIEWS, embellished with numerous Animated Objects, each forming a piece of Mechanism which gives to it a movement resembling that of Life. The
surprising ingenuity and harmless tendency of this Exhibition are particularly calculated to attract the notice and support
of those whoso religious tenets forbid their participation in amusements of a more decided character.
SCENE 1 .

BOWAPART
AND HIS ARMY OF RESERVE CROSSING THE ALPS.

This Piece presents to the Spectator a correct View of the Alp* in all their native wildness : the tops of Mountains, towering amidst the regions of perpetual snow, seem to defy the approach of man, whilst the overhanging Avalanche threatens him with instantaneous destruction; yet up these Mountains the enterprising Napoleon is seen to lead an Army of
•'M),000 Men, with Cannon, Bag gage, Ammunition Waggons, &c. After the most arduous exertion, every obstacle is surmounted, they arrive at the summel of this awful barrier.
SCENE 11 —

THE

CITY OF

ISPAHAN
THE CAPITAL OF PERSIA.

On the Bridge and the Banks of the River several Figures are seen to pass and re-pass, forming one of the most animating Scenes that can possibly be conceived. A GRAND AQUATIC EXHIBITION will take place—Pleasure Boats
of every description—to conclude with the
ASCENT O F A MOST S P L E N D I D BALLOON,
vrlulethe City Bridges and River will be crowded with Spectators and Vehicles of every description to witness so great a
novelty, when the .Balloon will be seen to ascend.

SCENE

I I I . T H E CITY OF

ConstantinopleWhich will be enlivened by numerous and interes'ing objects.

SEA

The Scene terminates with a Representation of'a

FIGHT.

In the course of the evening Mr. Clapton will introduce his

EGYPTIAN PYRAMID OF 1 5 WINE GLASSES.
By placing them on a board in three tiers, five in a tier, and striking the board from underneath the whole, without breaking the glasses or spilling the water ! From the extreme difficulty attending the performance of this feat, which is considered by all who have witnessed it to be a perfect masterpiece of dexterity, its accomplishment has invariably elicited universal approbation ~Mr. Clapton challenges any person, whether NATIVE OR FOREIGNER, to perform the feat for
ONE
H U N D R E D
SOVEREIGNS.
The whole of this unparalleled Entertainment will conclude with a Grand Moving Mechanical Scenic Representation,
with appropriate Phenomena, entitled the

WRECK OF T H E

FORFARSHIRE;

'Tis she—'tis Grace brave Darling's child !
'Tis she, so gentle, young, and good,
Her lullaby the tempest wild—
Who on the shattered wreck had stood,
'Tis she, impelled by duty's call,
And bid the captive hope,
Dar'd that which others might appal—
»*
This Representation opens with a DREADFUL STORM ! Ships in distress ! The PEGASUS and INNISFA1L
STEAMERS are seen to pass in the distance, on their passage from Hull to Leith. DAYBREAK, Friday Morniii"September 7th, 1S38, the ill-fated FORFARSHIRE seen drifting towards the FERN ISLAND. She strikes the
HARK.ARA ROCKS with a crash so tremendous as to BREAK HER IN TWO PIECES about midships.
T E R R I F I C
MOMENT!
While, tha bow of the vessel is left on the rock, the quarter-deck, with all thereon, and the cabin, with its passeng; rs,
are engulphed in the raging ocean. The passengers and the crew on the bow of the vessel are seen clinging to the
mast and rigging. In this dreadful condition were they left from four in the morning, when the vessel struck, till
eight, when their cries were heard by GRACE DARLING in the Lighthouse.
Ob ! father loved, the storm is raging,
Trim, trim the lamp! the boat launch quickly!
Cold and heavy the night mist fall;
Tho' danger threaten, the worst we'll brave;
Some hapeless crew, a prey to danger,
The toil I heed not, if we can rescue
For help, for help, despairing calls.
The sbipwreck'd wanderers from the grave.

William Harling a n d Grace seen on t h e P a r a p e t of tlie Lighthouse.
My dearest child, Mis worse than madness
To temp the billows this fearful night

To sleep, my child—to rest betake thee—
Await, await the morning's light.

1 cannot sleep, their shrieks appal me—
Oh, father ! heard ye that piercing cry ?
Arise, then, hasten, the day is breaking—
Look oui, look uut, <i T o o k I spy!

O! father loved, I fear no danger;
With you I'll boldly breast the wave—
The boat launch quickly! the boat launch quickly !
Yon hapelos.i rrew we yet may save.

Grace Marling & h e r venerable F a t h e r leave the Lighthouse in their Boat.
The boat is launched, thro' breakers roaring,
'I he gentle girl, with love unshaken,
Like to some wild bird, the frail skiff flew i
The gentle girl hath saved the crew I
In such a desperate and terrific character did this heroic girl venture, wiih her sturdy father, on the overwhelming billow*,
to save her fellow creatures' lives, or perish in the courageous effort.

The little B a r k is Tossed by t h e Raging Billows.
They reach the Harkara Rock, and rescue the sufferers from their perilous situation; they row towards the Lighfhou.e, which they reach in safety. Thus the noble, the heroic Grace Darling and her Father, by their noble daring
and courageous efforts, SAVE NINE of their fellow-creatures from a GRAVE in the FATHOMLESS OCEAN.
The danger past, her heart beats lightly,
Tho' grateful tears are round her falling,
Her silent transport no pride betrays,
And hearts still throbbing to her praise.
THE WHOLE ACCOMPANIED WITH APPROPRIATE MUSIC.
Tickets to be had of Mr. HOME, Bookseller—Front Seats Is. Gd. Second Seats Is. Gallery 6dChildren under 12 Years of Age, Half-price.

FOR SIX NIGHTS ONLY.
MR. H E N D E R S O N
Manager of the Theatres, Ludlow, Brecon, Kidderminster, &c.
most respectfully begs to announce to the Nobility, Gentry, Visitors, and Public generally, ofTenbury and its Vicinity, that
he is fitting up a neat and commodious Theatre in which every attention will be paid to the comfort and convenience of
the visitors, and which will be

O P K N K D our

Tuesday, September 12th. 1 8 4 3 .
The Manager in making this announcement, most respectfully solicits the support of the Public, and pledges himself that no
pains shall be spared to merit their approbation.
The Performances will be of a varied, unique, and pleasing nature, combining instruction, with amusement.
AND SUPPORTED BY

ERFO1

OF ACKNOWLEDGED

T A L E N T AND

N

RESPECTABILITY.

The whole will be conducted on a scale of propriety, and moral tendency, which the Manager trusts will obtain for him
that general commendation which it will be his anxious study to deserve.
In these days of improvement, when Societies for the circulation of Literature, Sciences and Arts, are continuing to spread with
irresistible rapidity, and undeniable advantages, little need be said to recommend the STAGE to Public Notice : for in addition to
its being one of the best Schools for Morality, it possesses a four-fold advantage, in amusing the Learned, instructing the Ignorant,
confounding the Guilty, and rewarding the Virtuous.
" To hold as 'twere the Mirror up to Nature,
" To shew Virtue her own Feature, Scorn her own
" Image, and the very age and body of
" The Time his form and pressure."
Surely, then, the Stage, with so many points in its favour, cannot fail to receive support from the enlightened classes of the
Nineteenth Century,
The Performances will commence with a highly popular Piece, adapted from Sir Walter Scott's Work of the same name called, T H E

Reanimation ! ! !
In performing the above extraordinary Delusion the
Wizard will introduce a new laid Egg, a beautiful little
Canary, a splendid bouquet of Flowers, and a

MAGNETIC T U L I P .

SECOND SIGHT,
OR, THE

POLMOSCOPIAN T U B E
. This feat will put to blush the land where
"~~~—"dire magicians throw their mists around,
And wise men walked as on enchanted ground."

One evening last week, during the performance of the
Wizards wonders, one of the most extraordinary scenes
took place that we ever remember to have witnessed, the
Wizard was about to commence the performance of his
celebrated wedding ring trick, when he inquired if any
lady would favor him with her wedding ring for a few
minutes. The Wizard appealed in vain for the golden
circlet and was about to give up the execution of this
strange delusion, when an old Lady said he might have
hers, if he would assure her he would return it safe. The
Wizard pledged his word to return the ring uninjured,
As soon as he got it fairly into his possession, he took a
hammer and commenced breaking the pledge of love into
pieces, when the old lady got up and exclaimed with a
scream, "Is that the ring my poor husband put on my
finger? that you are breaking in pieces ?" Not thinking
anything serious, the Wizard replied in the affirmative,
when the old lady scrambling through the crowd got
upon the platform, and the following scene took place,
which was listened to with a fixed attention by the audience. She seized the pieces, which the Wizard had
broken, and looking on the fragments of her ring, ex
claimed you are a fiend ! a monster ! the devil himself ! !
—The curses of an old Woman be upon vou ! May the
spirit of him who placed the ring on my linger for ever
haunt you! I see him now pointing at me—mocking me I
—telling me that the tie in Heaven is broken which
bound us together on earth and that we tball not meet
hereafter! The distracted woman, in a state of frenzy,
seized the Wizard by the hand, and said—"If you have
any pity for a heart-broken widow, as you love the happiness of your own mother, restore my ring, or I shall
go mad!" The Wizard alarmed at the old ladies excitement and powerful language replied. My good woman, I
will not harm your ring, for look! it is on your finger!"
The old lady in a fit of joy, fainted, and was carried off.—

Black Eyed Susan,
FOR ONE NtGIIT ONLY!

On

FRIDAY,

EVENING,

24th.

JULY,

1835,

\V ill ba Performed the Nautical and Domestic Melo Drama, entitled

Black Eyed
USAN;
Or, all in the Downs.

A oroa^pr encomium or more powerful recommendation eannot be bestowed to render this interesting Piece acceptable to the patrons ot the Drama, than that vhich we witness in the advertisements
of the public, papers—the fact of its having been represented 509 nights. There is not, perhaps,
any passion, circumstance, or situation in life, that conies home to the feelings, or finds such interest
in the ncnerous and sensitive breant, as the dissolution of domestic felicity, which forms the principal
action of this Drama, T h e piece is founded on that universally known and popular Son-r,

"All in the Downs the Fleet was

Moord"

Independent of which it forms a most interesting fable, abounding with a variety of {incidents, which
have not failed to excite the laugh of mirth, the tear of sympathy, and the burst of satisfaction.
W I L L I A M is united to the celebrated BLACK EVF.l) SUSAN—adverse circumstance, compel
him lo leave bis home, be becomes a brave and esteemed Sailor in the British Navy.
During an
absence of three years, Susan is distressed by the. Cruelty of her Uncle ; and a Smuggling Captain
supposing her situation will compel her to marry him, invents a tale of her husband's death. The
presence of William at the moment defeats the plot. Susan attracts the Notice of William's
Captain, be attacks her while alone
William comes to her relief, and.wounds h i . Captain; be
is taken, tried by a Court Martial—and, by the 3'2nd. Article of War, is

The Laird of Glencairn (being summoned to the Wars) leaves his Castle, Wife and
Child, to the care of his brother Clanronald, the latter, alter his departure, becomes enamoured of the Countess Adela, his brother's wife, to further his unlawful purposes, waylay,
her husband on his return, and supposing his end completed, leaves the body to be interred
by one of his accomplices: life not being extinct, he (the accomplice) relents, and agrees to
rave the Earl, having first administered to him

A N E X T O R T E D OATH,
that he would never to mortal man reveal himself till he (the accomplice) should be no
more. Six years disguised as a Warlock, he

keep, it inviolate. The Countess meanwhile, nnible longer to bear the persecutions of
his brother, flies from the Castle with her Child, but b;ing closely pursued, and on the
point of being overtaken,

Leaps from a Rock into the Sea;
from whence she is rescued by a Fisherman in a boat, and carried to his cottage. The
murderer dying, the Count is released from his Oath, and thfows olTbis disguise—asserts
his rights—and at the moment Clanronald (who has again retaken his fugitive) is dragging
her to the nuptial ceremony,

HIS BROTHER APPEARS AT THE ALTAR.
Conscience stricken, he shrinks from the sight and is borne off, after desperatc'y attempting
his own life. This interesting Drama thus concluding with

Performance
and in proof of this, the following Paragraph from the London Press is inserted:—
'•To blend instruction with amusement, to hold the Mirror up to Nature, and to shew Vice her
own deformity, has been, and is the solo intention of Theatrical Representations. No Play that ever
was produced, more fully effects these beneficial purposes, than that now advertised. It is written
with the strictest regard to morality, and it is generally asserted, that no man could rise from witnessing the representation of this Play without being improved and enlightened; the principles it inculcates
are! in strict unison with both the civil and ecclesiastical Laws of Nations, and it brings before the

O
To every inhabitant of Kent, this Play must possess a home interest and association, bringing to each almost a
personal attachment in the Scenes displayed, and t i e incidents described. We are ready to look with kindly eyes on all
that is connected with, ourselves or our fathers, and the "LIIGEND OF HEKONDI:^'' is a story to be told by the village
green, or on a winter's evening by the country firo-sidc.
" H o - 1 wish that I had l n ' d
1,1 the iiieirn- time of old,
And seen the sights and heard the tale.
Our chroniclers have told!
Yet I wish not I had liv'd
in the olden time alone;
But all that lov'd me, all I lov'd,
Had been side by side my own.

"My mother hath sate l».|iuil.»l> MM., "My love had plied fecr broidery,
1" . h i g h old-t,ishioned ehair,
Or pacrd the turret tow'r;
And thought of time* Ionic since .rone by, The minstrel song of chivalry
And those that onee sate t h e r e - —
Had wiled away t o . hour!
In the stout old hall with trophies 1 . - . .
And when the earth was clad in niyi't,
The jrreat ones of their day,
H e y ! for the merry dance;
W h o had | . M to rest in the silent home Our only light the stais ibo\e,
T h a t knows of no deeay.
And the maiden's flashing glance.

"And y e t ' t i s better'tw;M not t".
Then nor tl.ey noi 1 weie here
To share in all each other's Joy.

Scenery, Machinery, Dresses, and Decorations, called, The

VOr,ATheMBrideP ofI the
R Isles.
E;

The decided success of this Drama in France, caused its immediate introduction to the British Stage,
where it was, .if possible, still more triumphant in its career, having been played in four of our Metropolitan
Theatres nearly the whole of a season. '1 he tale on which it is founded is generally attributed to the able
pen of Lord Byron, and embodies one of the wildest Levantic superstitions. Vampires are supposed to
be Beings permitted to roam the Earth endowed with extraordinary powers of fascination, but subject still
at stated periods to a dreadful tribute.
Their existence is prolonged by marrying some fair and virtuous Maiden whom they must afterwards
kill, from her veins drain the purple stream of life, w hich horrid draught alone hath power to save them
from swift extermination.

To conclude with the much admired Melo Drama of

HESE,

T H E ORPHAN OF GENEVA.

The incidents comprised in this Drama, are drawn from facts which occured in and near Geneva, where an Orphan
named Therese, was, from circumstantial evidence, condemned ; but by the artful advice of her treacherous Advocate,(Carwin)
tied the punishment that awaited her. She was received by the Countess de Morville and about to be allied to her son, when
iiei persecutor discovers her, and compels her again to fly. Taking refuge at night at a farm kept by Lavigne, where the
Countess also happens to be a visitor, Carwin, by mistake destroys the Countess in her bed instead of Therese, for whom it had
previously been piepared. Therese, flying to preserve the Countess, is caught coming from her chamber the moment after tlit
imrder is perpetrated—is seized and accused of the murder. Carwin is however taken lurking about the farm, and by close interroirations, and force of conscience, (taking the appearance of Therese, whom he supposed he had slain, for a supernatural
object,) confesses his guilt; evincing a positive instance of the certain destruction of vice, and the triumph of virtue.

BY

In Act II.

An enormous

Serpent

Is discovered gliding among the branches of the lofty trees, near Seafield's pavillion.
It descends to the ground, prowling for its prey: the groans of Seafield and his Son
in the pavillion attract its attention ; the doors and shutters are closed and barred ;
having in vain examined every part of the building to discover an aperture to enter
by, the Serpent displays its extraordinary agility and strength in repeated endeavours to force an entrance; its attention is called offby a Buffalo crossing the scene*
the Serpent springs with fury upon the unwieldy animal, and twining its snaky folds
around it, in a few moments crushes it to death. At this instant, Everard courageously attacks the monster, kills it, and preserves his friend and benefactor.

THE SERPENT,
A curious piece of Mechanism, contrived by Mr. Woodyer, assistant Mechanist of
the Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden, gives a most exact idea of the
movements and stupendous powers of this

IN ACT SECOND,

An Enormous Serpent
Is discovered gliding among the branches of the lofty trees, near Seafield's Pavilion; it descends to the
ground, prowling for its prey ; the groans of Seafield and his Son in the Pavilion attract its attention ; the
doors and shutters are closed and barred; having in vain examined every part of the building, to discover
an aperture to enter by, the Serpent displays its extraordinary agility and strength in repeated endeavours to
force an entrance ; its attention is called off by a Buffalo crossing the scene, the Serpent springs with fury
upon the unwieldy animal, and twining its snaky folds around it, in a few moments crushes it to death. At
this instant, Everard courageouslv attacks the Monster, kills it, and preserves his friend and benefactor.

THE SERPENT,
A curious piece of Mechanism, contrived by Mr. WOODYER, assistant Machinist of the Theatre-Royal,
Covent-Garden, gives a most exact idea of the movements and stupendous powers of this

This excellent production includes the whole of the incidents of the strange and wonderful events of the Heroine's life,
from whom the piece his named. Charles of France being driven from the Throne by the Usurper, seeks the recovery of it
with his faithful adherents, but suffers several defeats and is almost wholly routed ; at his last extremity is introduced to him
'JOAN OF ARC,' whom he first regards as a mad woman, but she giving a proof of her sanity, is permitted to head his
troops, whom she leads to Victory in every direction, and finally regains for him the Cities of Orleans and Rheimcs, and her
glorious career ends in restoring him to all his Rights; after which (her object being accomplished) she resigns her allconquering sword to her Sovereign, and departs for her former humble home. On the road she is waylaid and seized by
traitors to the State, tried by them, and condemned to be

Burned Alive as a Sorceress, at the Public Stake!
which sentence is about to be fulfilled, when she is rescued from the flames by her King. The situations of the Drama are
secularly striking—her Visions which are fulfilled -her different Victories—Charles's entrance into the City—her awful
Trial—the capture and narrow escape with life of her Father—the historical facts which the incidents embrace—and the
pleasing relief which the Comic Characters give to the whole, make it perhaps one of the most entertaining Spectacles ever
produced on the British Stage.

emissaries; and so skilful were his arts of disguise, that he was often made the confidant of plots laid
by his enemies to entrap him,—he was a strict dispenser of moral justice ; if he made free with the tich,
he was the Almoner of the poor; and he nercr did resort to violence, but when a tempting booty and
stout resistance stood in his way.

IDE RENT DAY
The decided success " T H E R E N T D A Y " met with at Drury-Lane, has induced the Manager to
get it up with every possible care and attention- This piece is founded on Mr. WILKIE'S. celebrated
Picture, of " T H E R E N T D A Y , " and " D I S T R A I N I N G F O R R E N T . " The Fable is
tmgeneously supplied with a variety of situations and characters; in one scene be compels us to a
hearty laugh, in another the tears are drawn from our eyes; in this scene we are exposed vice and folly,
in another, misfortune wringing the hearts of an honest family, the victims of an heartless Rascal! Our
pity, admiration, and contempt are called forth by Mr. Jerrold the Author, as tho' he had command of
our feelings and used them at his pleasure.

On Wednesday Evening, August 24,1836
Will be Performed the admired historical Play, of The

D A Y S OF OLD.

The plot of this interesting piece is frunded on the long and ruinous contentions between the houses of
York and Lancaster, with which evory reader of English 1 listory is well acquainted. Gondibert having
by his attachment to the House of iancaster incurred the resentment of his opponents, and shared in the
misery in which it was involved, Mires in disgust from the civilized world, associates with horde of Banditti,
and becomes their leader. In one of his midnight prowls for lawless plunder, he ENCOUNTERS T H E
Q U E E N AND S O N O F HiNRY V I . who are seeking protection from their friends, or a shelter from the
persecutions of their ene"uics> Ignorant of their rank and stimulated only by that hostility to mankind,
with which want, and the recollection of his wrongs inspired him, he demands their property, when the
Queen, with a cop<1dence in the generous feelings of human nature, which noble minds are alone capable
of entertaining, throws herself and child on his mercy, commanding him " O N HIS ALLEGIANCE T O
SAVE T H E S O N O F H I S A N O I N T E D K I N G ! " Awed by these words, the uplifted sword falls from his
nerveless arm, and the outlawed depredator roused by those impulses of loyalty which had slumbered, but
were not extinct in his bosom, becomes the friend and protector of suffering Majesty, H e conducts them
in safety to their friends, where his loyalty is rewarded by the recovery of his wife, Adeline, who, attended
by a faithful servant, Gregory Gubbins, had adventured in disguise in search of her lord and husband.

THE GYPSY.

This Drama is universally allowed to be, without exception, the most interesting piece that has been presented on
the British Stage for many years ; the incidents and situations are, in the most impressive manner, combined by
the author to form a chain of dramatic effect, not to be equalled by any other production ; the constant felicity
ever attendant on innocence and virtue are pourtrayed in a style which has given as much deli ght to an English
audience as any theatrical exhibition ever represented.

Spectre of the Bleeding Nun
------------This Melo-drama is founded on the most beautiful part of M, G. LEWIS'g celebrated Romance of the MONK.
The Piece commences with the departure of Don Raymond from his Father's Castle : he arrives in Madrid : falls
in love with the beautiful Agnes, who is about to return from the convent to her native Chateau ; Don Raymond
i«. determined on following, her Father being a particular friend of his family : in this determination he sets out
with his faithful Theodore for

THE BLACK FOREST.
Which proves to be a retreat for Banditti,

where by the villiany of the postilion the Carriage breaks down, and he is decoyed into a Wood-cutter's cottage
the terror of the neighbouring country. After a variety of interesting circumstances, (wherein the life of the young
C.'Hevalier is frequently attempted). Raymond's suspicions are entirely confiirmed, by the contrivances of Marguerite the Robber's Wife ; he resolves to defend himself to the last, and with the aid of Marguerite, eludes their
present machinations : but unfortunately Agnes and her attendants are likewise betrayed into the fatal Cottage ;
the Villians are about to assassinate them all ! and to that end administer a sleeping potion in their drink—but
ultimately they reach in safety the Castle of Lindenberg. The Haron, however, averse to the presence of Raymond, banishes him the Chateau.
In the midst of th" despair which this circumstance occasions, Raymond receives a billet from the lovely Agnes, couched in the following terms :—
••WHEN THE CASTLE BELL TOLLS ONF,
"EXPECT J1E AS THE BLEEDING NUN."
Raymond resolves to attend and at the appointed hour the Ghost of the murdered Nun appears, and conducts him
to the spot where the inhuman deed was committed,

T h e n »anlt»hing* i n t o a F l a m e of R e d F i r e ,
the awful words are seen inscribed above his head
P R O T E C T T H E CHILD OF T H E .MURDERED AGNES,
l!c vows to devote his future life to revenge her death, and then flies to the rescue of Agnes,

B l a c k - E y e d SUSAN,
Or, ALL IN THE DOWNS.
Thi* i* one of the very beat Drama* t h e Stage h a s produced for some time : founded on GAY'S pathetic Ballad of the same nam.:, which
has been t h e established favorite for so many years, of all who bave taken any interest in the gallant preservers of our country, it could scarcely fail of success when i t became t h e subject of a D r a m a ; — s u c h h a s been t h e r e s u l t : and t h e intense interest excited by i t . production in London, is without parellel in the annals ol t h e S t a g e . After an unprecedented run of 2 5 0 successive nights a t a minor Theatre
it h a s been transferred t o the T h e a t r e - R o y a l , Covent G a r d e n , where it continues to a t t r a c t overflowing houses. T h e character of William is
drawn with great e n e r g y : in his characteristic reflections we hear t h e roaring of t h e tempest, t h e creaking o f t h e masts, a n d t h e cries
of t h e m a r i n e r s ; t h e lightning flashes in o u r eyes, t h e water booms in our ears,
and attain all is hushed ! See the Sailor in his
thoHghtfulnes* of mystery, and William on t h e high and giddy mast beholds t h e ocean with a meditating eye, adores it »s hts .let-ient,
and reposes on its billows
" As sweetly as a child
Whom neither thought disturb., nor ear* encumber,.,
Tired with long play,
At clow of summer's day,
Lies down and slumbers. "
In short, If the merits of the Piece are measured by its effects, It cannot fail of ensuring the most unqualified approbtUlo.

On Friday Evening, February 20th, 1835.
W I L L BE P R E S E N T E D LlLLO'a TRAOEDY OF

ftEORGE RARNWELI
Or, The London Merchant,

THIS affecting Tragedy, the moral tendency of which has been so beneficial to the rising generation, was founded upon fact. The unfortunate hero of this piece, was executed for the Murder of his virtuous and venerable Uncle, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to which he
was instigated by an artful, cruel, and abandoned Woman, step by step she led the unwary Youth to the last cruel deed, which terminated
a miserable existence, by the most ignominous death.
A story is reported, and the fact can be proved by many living witnesses, that a Young Gentleman of the City of London having embezzled
part of his Master's property, was providentially at the representation of "George Barnwell" at Drury Lane, when the admirable actor Mr.
Moss personated George Barnwell, at whose fate he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and reformation. The Gentleman so benefited by this excellent Tragedy was not ashamed to own his obligation to the Play and Performer, for at every subsequent
yearly benefit, Mr. Moss received a Hundred Pounds sterling, with a Card to the following effect:—
" Dear Sir,—One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell, for more than life ! for hit redeemed honour and
" credit!—begs your acceptance of the enclosed, which sum you Will receive yearly as long as you continue in your profession. Happy am I to
" acknowledge that the Stage hat prevented mejrom ruin and disgrace. 'GEORGE
BARNWELL'
stopped mein my mad career, end saved
" me from an ignominous death.
" lam, $e
— A Convert."
A celebrated and learned Divine observes, that " Fathers and heads of families, whose duty it is to watch over and guide the morals of the rising
" generation, would do well to permit young people, under their direction, to be present at the performance of this excellent Tragedy, in which
" instruction is blended with amusement.

On MONDAY Evening, March 2nd. 1835,
Will be .performed an entire new Nautical Drama, ( b / the popular author of "Black-eyed Susan") entitled THE

At the Nore;
or, British

Sailors in LTOST,

This remarkable point in our Naval History took place, as is well known, in the year 1797, and was emphatically called by the sailors, the BRBKZE at the Nore.
The extraordinary and masterly organization of their system struck terror into the stoutest hearts, and called forth characters and situations in themselves so dramatic
tlwit ftinuli skill Was required in the author to arrange them for representation. The noble use made by the seamen of the mighty power in their hands, is now a subject
,jf astonishment to all, and realizes more forcibly than any other point in history, the romantic gallantry of a British Sailor. Lately the public attention has been more
particularly directed towards the Bulwarks of Britain than before ; the far-famed novel of the "King's Own," and this Drama, both relative to these subjects, have excl.
'M more attentloa throughout the Conutry than any literary productions of the day,

Jonathan

Bradford,

Or9 The Murder at the Boad Side Inn,
The Music composed and arranged by Mr. TURLE.
THIS Drama lias been allowed to possess the most affecting incidents, speaking volumes to every heart. The happiness of the Innkeeper,
BRADFORD, and his Wife, surrounded by their family—the arrival of Mr. HAYES—the deep villainy of DAN M'CRAISY—the ludicorus accident of CALEB SCRUMMAGE—THE MURDER—the affecting interview of BRADFORD and his WIFE, previous to Execution—and t><e
discovery and awful Death of the real Murderer, form a picture that must at once assure the spectator that Justice, though often delayed, eventually
strikes the Guilty. It is only necessary to add that this Drama has been played 100 successive Nights, and is still running a career of unabated success

Thi. Piece is founded on the celebrated Ballet of

' L A SOMNAMBULE,'
Of M. M. Scribe and Aumer, which on k. first production at the Theatres in Paris, sa much engrossed thit attention of the French Critic*. Its
•oception in the English Metropolis has bean equally fortunate. The story of the piece i. at once aimple and touching. A young Village Maiden,
in the eve of her marriage, and who is (we may My) afflicted with

SOMNAMBULISM,

.

Is found in a Stranger's Room at Midnight!—Every thing fails to convince her Lover of her innocence, till he himself witnesses, what he Itud before
Considered a delusion.—ERNES1TNE having retired to repose in despair for the rejection she has met with, is seen to emerge from

An Attic Window (sleeping,) and to proceed along a Plank

OVER AGAINST A WATER-MILL!
HER FOOT TOUCHES THE BOARD |—IT SNAPS BENEATH HER FEET!

The Wheel Turns Rapidly, and Threatens to Crush her to Atoms
Recollection seems to aid her—she retreats—Advances to her Friends—and on Awaking She finds her Felicity Complete ! her
Innocence fully Established.

Tiverton Hunt.

Or, THE MAID OF MILAN!!
The name of H O M E must carry with it the most tender recollections. There is not a native even of the wildest anions, who, when removed
by circumstances far from those scenes where his earliest affections rose, does not feel his heart softened into teudern '»« at the thought of Home.
This beautiful and interesting Drama presents the operation of this delightful feeling with a warmth and richness of coloring never before attempted. Clari. a .voting Italian Peasant, has been indueed to quit her home, bj the persuasions and promises of a No.tleuiuu of Milan. In
.1 moment of agony s!ie discovers the fallaciousness of the promises by which she has bee. beguiled.
Her thoughts then revert to the innocent
and happy scenes she has quitted. Distracted at the painful situation in which her imprudence has placed her, she resolves on flight, to seek
that peacelul home which her unhappy desertion has converted into a wilderness of sorrow, ami fling herself with penitence ami remorse at
the Ktt of her justly offended Parents. To describe the denouement is impossible, and it must be witnessed to be fully conceived.
" Whnt sounds so exquisitely dear,
S. pleasing to a Briton's ear,
As the lov'd name of H u . i ?

This Drama, which has never failed to aUract crowded and delighted audiences in every part of the kingdom, is
founded on a popular nautical superstition.
The Flying Dutchman, is said to be an Amsterdam Vessel, which about a
Century ago sailed from that port , the master's name was Vanderdecken, whose constant boast it was, that "he would
always have his own way, in spite of the devil." Once, on doubling the cape, they were a whole day trying to weather
Table Bay, the wind increasing a-head of them, and Vandordecken walking the deck, continued swearing fearfully.—
Just after sun-set, he was spoke by a vessel, who asked him if he did not mean to go into the bay that night, to which
Vanderdecken, with a tremendous oath, replied, "he would not, though he should beat about till the Day of Judgment."
Vanderdecken never did go into Table Bay, and is believed to undergo the doom he so desperately dared.
His vessel
is still seen in the Cape Seas in foul weather, sailing against the fiercest storm, with every inch of canvass sot, striving
in vain to reach her home, or to send dispatches to relatives by other vessels.
The hints upon which this Drama is
founded, were taken from a short and interesting article in Blackwood's Magazine, from whence also the above account
is extracted.

With all the original Music, composed and arranged for the Orchestra by Mr. T. Cooke, director of Music at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.
The Hero of this Piece was a sort of Italian Robin Hood, chief of the lawless Band, infesting the Mountains near Rome. No place was secare from
his emissaries, and so Skilful were his Disguises, that he was frequently made the confidant of [dots laid by his Enemies to entrap him. Such an air of
tiallantry and Chivalry accompanied his depredations that they were frequently the theme of laudatory rhymes, and those who paid the dearest for his
pranks, were often the first to laugh at his humour.

On MONDAY Evening, January 29th, 1838,
Will be presented a striking and most interesting Drama called the

GAMBLER'S
FATE s
Or, A L A P S E O F TWENTY Y E A R S .

Thi» M-lo-Dranae hold, forth a lesson of deep importance to the Titled Gambler who stakes his Thousands, down to the meanest wretch that
ever Gambling made it» victim. It is a beautiful picture of domestic woe, produced by this execrable passion,—every character is true to nature,
every incident belong, to the affecting drama of real life. Those whose hearts have not been rendered entirely callous hy long familiarity with
dissipation and vice, it may arrest in their ruinous career. The desperate hardened Gambler requires a strong stimulant to awaken his remorse,
and that stimulant the MeUo-Di'aine before us rery powerfully supplies.

On W e d n e s d a y Evening, J a n u a r y 31st, 1838,
Will be presented a popular Nautical Drama, written by Mr. Ball, and called the

PILOT
Or, A STORM AT S E A !

This Dramatic Piece is taken from the well known Tale of the " Pilot," by Mr. Cooper, which i» written with all the spirit, energy, and
boldness of character and colouring that mark an original genius : it is well calculated for Theatric Exhibition. Mr. Ball has preserved a good
portion of the original language to which his own offers no discredit.
We hear the roaring of the tempest, the creaking of the masts, and the cries of the mariners ; the lightning flashes in our eyes, awl
the water booms in our ears; and if its merits are measured by its effects it will receive almost unqualified praise.
Although the popularity of a Piece is not the surest criterion of its merits, the present one is an exception. It was played upwards of
"TWO HUNDRED NIOHTS" on its first production. The character of Long Tom is splendidly drawn,—reared upon the waters, he is at
home on the high and giddy mast,—he beholds the ocean with a meditative eye, adores it as his element, and reposes ou its billows
" As sweetly as a child "
" Whom neither thouht disturbs, nor care encumbers,"
" Tired with long play,"
" A t close of day,"
" Lies down and slumbers."
