Mr.

LECLERCQ.

Success of the Magnificent

Spectacle!

| 3 - T h e T a l e o f " V A T H E K " written b y the celebrated Mr. Beckford is remarkable, no less for the powerful interest of the Story,
r o d the grand and obvious moral it conveys, than for its lively delineation of Oriental Customs and Superstitions, and of the
Magnificence which surrounds the Court of an Eaitern Monarch.
I n preparing the Drama founded on this singular production of
genius for the Stage, the Proprietor has been determined that it shall receive every possible aid within the limit, of Theatrical
exertion to supply. F o r this purpose, every possible research has been rande for" authorities, and under their guidance every
department of the Theatre, has, for some Mont.li>, been iu « state of unremitting activity. No expence has been spared, and th*
Manager challenges the annals of the Stage to adduce a precedent of such unbounded cast, and such gorgeous Magnificence, and
such correct portraiture of Oriental Scenery, Dress, Superstitions, and Customs, as will be displayed in the New Spectacle.

$ 3 * The enormous Expence attendant on the Production of so Splendid a NOVELTY, renders it imperative on the
Manager peremptorily to exclude All Orders and Free Admissions whatsoever during its Performance.

ambitious projects of Revolutionary France, her Chiefs, and Rulers, rendered necessary ; none was more siugalized by the adventurous,
daring, and skilful conduct ot the gallant Officer who Commanded, and of those who served under him, than the defence of the Portress of Acre ';
vigorously besieged by the Army of Egypt, wider the cotmamA of General Buonaparte in person, and defended only by a Turkish Force of inadequate
number, the English Commodore bravely threw himself into the place, with a handful of daring heroes like himself. The skilful measures adopted by the
English Commander, his chivalrie valour, and that of his men, and the effect of their example on the Turkish Troops, euubled the united Forces to repel
the furious attacks of the French, by Sea and Laad, and finally compelled them, after a grand and rigorous Assault, to RAISE the SIF.UK, and
abandon all hope of penetrating from Egypt into Syria. ^

This splendid Tlieatre has been entirely Re-EtnbelliaSjed on a most majfiitrkeut and cosily Scale, and rendered, without
exception, the most Commodious and FJejrant in Europe. In the Audience part «fthe Theatre, such a complete Cbmye
and Renovation lias taken ptecp, as to render it an entirely \mirelle Feature to its roustwit \ isitors; and, it is presumed, iliut
the new costly Embellishments will be found characterized, no less by Taste titan by Splendor. In the arran^enjent of these
extensive Alterations, an attempt has hem >»ia<le to nuitr. *llr. utmost magnifW'euce with the most chaste and classical puritv
of design. The Cove of the Proscenium is ornamented with beautiful allegorical Paintings, re|u-esenting- Britannia, tttpported by Thalia and Melpomene invoking the aid of Apollo on this Establlulmient. Thebrillianey and elegance of the new
Central Lostre, it is trusted, will !«> found to defy competition, and tljegeneral effect to be at once the «ost classical, elegant,

T h i s splendid Theatre lias been entirely lie-Embellished on a most magnificent ami costly Scale, aud rendered, without

In the Audience part of the Theatre, such a complete Change

latarrat, as being the Foundation of many of our Laws, Customs and Institutions, which subsist to the preseut time, and more especially, as developing the

«?^*>=-»The Splendid Dramatic Poem of " PaustS* by the Celebrated Goethe, is allowed by the whole Literary World, to be the most Sublime, Heartl K l £ ? rending, Impressive, and Terrific Composition that has appeared since the Days of Shakespeare. The Proprietor of the ROYAL CQBUno THEATRE
anxious to introduce to the Stage the most Magnificent Production of the Era, has lavished the resources of th« Establishment, on an endeavour to realize
the brilliant imaginings of the Poet's mighty genius, In the construction of this Drama, the partial Translations of Lord I.eveson Gcwer. Blackwood's
Magazine, and the late Percy ftyshe Shelly, have been consulted, and their deficiencies for Stage Representation attempted to be supplied by the present
Author, who, in associating his own humble efforts wtili those of a master-genius like Goethe, can only plead in excuse, his desire to obtain for the Public
the gratification of witnessing that excellent compos.lion in a Theatrical shape ; an excuse, which he trusts will be admitted by the liberal and discerning
Petrous of the Co BURG THEATRE ; he has also to claim their indulgence for a lapse of Ten Months supposed to occur between the Second and Third Scenes of
the Second Act.—The Scenery and Dresses are correctly copied from the admirable outlines of Ketscli, engraved by Moses, and which are the admiration of
i the YV*rld of Art; and every possible efl'oit which Expence and Industry could accomplish, has been made to render this Spectacle worthy both the splendid
Poetry it comprises and of the Public Approbation.

The Author of ttrte Drama has endeavoured to produce an Entertainment without aspiring to she dignity of Tragedy, which might yal paitake of tragic
Pathos- and which should engi aft the licence and tbe assistance of Melo-Drama npon a Tale simple and natural arising not of an universal principle of animal
creation.—the fondness of a Parent for hm offspring, the tragedy of " Brutus " has displayed how far a Stoie Heroism and detoted Patriotism euutd overcome
the leehngs of parental nffeettm; the A utftoi has here endeatoured, by a far humbler median, to illustrate the overwhelming and mesjetible force
of those feelings.

ROYAL COBLRG THEATRE.
KJ-Tbe Managers ever anxious to obey the Public Voice, have great pleasure in announcing, that from the immense Overflows during the last Week to
wit**** the Performances of this Theatre, though contrary to their farmer pledge, consider themselves justified in Repeating the whole of the
Entertainments One Week longer. The Melo-Drama of the " KING'S. MISTRESS ; or, The Death of Jane Store," from the unusual combination
of Talent, and the zeal which every individual evinced, by an extraordinary exertion of that Talent, to merit the spontaneous and reiterated bursts of
Approbation conferred by a liberal and discriminating Public, and, (with modesty and truth it may be asserted,) never perhaps surpassed in any Theatre.
The PUREST KNIGHT has also been honoured on every Representation, with Roars of Laughter and universal Applause, while the HOMICIDE; or.
Spectre Knight, may be conaidered one of the most interesting, amusing, yet impressive Pieces ever produced.

MONDAY, AUGUST 23d, 1824, and During the Week, at Half-past Six o'Clock precisely,

KI TO T H E PUBLIC!!!

tn answer to the many rumours afloat respecting the New Historical Melo-Drama, which has been so long in Preparation at this Theatre, and in
deference to the Suggestions of its best and most generous Supporters, the Managers beg to notice, that in all Times and in all Countries, the Stage has
been held up, not only aa " the glass of fashion and the mould of form," bat as the " minor of morality." In the incessant search after novelty and shew,
the stores of Ancient History hsve been drained to their very lees—not a tale "but is at least twice told,"—white apathy has neglected, and industry ha*
shrank free* the more touching theme of modern times.—Not a Hero, a Tyrant, or a Sage of our own, or other Countries, but has had his eulogist and his
applauding crowds—while the petiod which baa elevated Britain ae high above surrounding States, and the character that has combined all that is great
ana dignified at a Monarch, all that is patriotic as a Citizen, and all that ia generous and amiable as a Man, haa slumbered among the fleeting paragraphs
of the day, among the half forgotten columns of a Newspaper,—History and Poetry stunned by the Nation's loss have yet done little elae but weep for him,
while it has remained for the happy combination of talent at present attached to this Establishment, to embody the scattered details, to exhibit the varied
excellence, and to revive and cherish the illustrious memory of this matchless man, to waken them to life, and give to diem " a local habitation and a name.'*
In justice to the efforts of the Author and the grandeur of his subject, and to accomplish, with suitable effect, this aspiring and, to tham, gratifying purpose,
the Managers have spared neither coat nor trouble. The unrivalled Artists of the Coburjr Theatre, and a numerous train of Auxiliaries, have been
incessantly engaged, during the last six weeks, upon the magnificent appointments of this Piece; Twenty-two entirely new Scenes, from well known local
subjects ; a multiplicity of elegant aud accurate Costume; and an unusual variety of expensive and sumptuous Properties and Decorations, are in each a
atatt of forwardness, as to guarantee their completion and perfection la the course of the ensning Week. The Drama is therefore announced far Monday Next,

GEORGE

the T H I R D , the Father of his People.

The numerous Characters, embracing the whole of the Company, and many valuable Additions : a 8k etch of the Scenery, and other copious details, will
be a nnouuced in due time, and the utmost confidence is felt of the full and complete satisfaction of a generous and discerning Public.

With a subject, perhaps unequalled in ihe Page of History ; ami a field of
action, enriched by thegrories of more than half a Century; the difficulty has
been, to select with judgment, and, having selected, lo combine with skill.
There are metals which do not amalgamate, but which require to be united
by extraneous aid.—This apology must be pleaded for the employment of
Fiction with Reality,—For the unavoidable mixture of dross amougst such
sterling ore.—But it is presumed that no less lenity will be shewn on this *

matchless Ma*,—Every exertion has been made, every sinew has bees vailed
into Action, to ensure that large portion of success which hss crowned the
former productions of the same Pen, and the same Artists of this Theatre.
With a-subject, perhaps unequalled in the Page of History ; and afieldof
action, enriched by the groriee-of more than half a Century ; the difficulty has
been, to select with judgment, and, having selected, to combine with skill.
There are met*!* which -do not amalgamate, but which require to be united
by extraneous aid.—This apology mast be pleaded for the employment of
•Fiction with Reality,—For the unavoidable mixture of dross amongst such
sterling ore.—But it is presumed that no leas lenity will be shewn on this
occasion, than the natural imperfectiena of dramatic representation have
ever claimed -for remoter subjects.—And that the Public will receive with
indulgence and approbation the following CATALOGUE of PORTRAITS

the Persons who inhaled it. T h e time of breathing this Oiu is about one minute, its affects last about a minute and half, during which
latter period, t h e person is not conscious of what t e !s doing, it produces in some involuntary muscular motion a a d a propensity to
Leaping, Running, Flying, involuntary Fits of Laughing, fee. All agree that the sensations felt are highly pleasurable, without any
subsequent debility, in snort it is considered one of the meat curious, remarkable, and at the same time one of the most amusing
experiments in the whole compass of Chemistry and Philosophy. When it was first dicovered by Sir Humphrey Davy, that this Gas
was susceptible of being breathed, the remarkable effect it produced induced many Ladies and Gentlemen of t h e first distinction in
E n g l a n d to respire it, all agreed that the sensation were highly pleasurable, b a t none have described its effects so poetically as
Robert Southey, E s q . Pott Lanreat, who said it produced in him sensations perfectly new and delightful, and he imagined several
hours nfterv. ards that hi* taste and smell were more acute than usual, and in a poetical rhapsody, remarked, that the highest o? all possible
Heavens must be composed of this Gas.

T H E PUBLIC.

Of til those awful political convulsions which have sk&krn Sutri, and disturbed the peace of mankind, not one, in either anc.fr,t or modem times, can, frctn
the circumstances of terror which attended ita explosion, or the mi perfance of its results, be compared to the

FRENCH

REVOLUTION!

By this sudden and terrible operation of popular feeling, unexpectedly breaking through the restraints by which, for ages, it had been Controlled. Bloodshed^
spoliation, rain, and desolation overspread one of the finest Countries in the world; Iroin which, like a. I'limm from its ashes, it arose to on meqnaller)
degree of prosperity, grandeur, and political consequence To the Flench (evolution maybe traced every political occurrence that has chequeiedthe face
of Europe, or interested its Inhabitants for the last thirty-five yean, and oh Englishmen, the remembrance of it must be indelibly impressed, by its having
for twenty-five years involved them in a momentous straggle with a gigantic power, from which they have conn, forth radiant with glory, prosperity and
peace. The Scenes which occurred daring that tremendous change in1 the government of France, the destruction of Monarchic Power, the substitution of
ItcpuMican, and afterwards of Imperial Domination, are snch aa Cannot be looked hack nnon without a shudder.

ffVio has not heard of the Reign of Terror/ of the Horrors of the Prench Revolution?
When Murder and Rapine stalked abroad in unchecked plenitude of Power, when Fear and Sorrow, in gloomy Majesty, ruled every heart, and the
darkness of Desolation caat its awfnl Shadow over the I and. These Scenes, Which History has traced npon the blackest P.-ge, and in Characters of
Blood, having now passed away, and their Constquenees healed by the all curing hand of time, are now become the Legitimate Property of the Dramatist
who dares to plunge into unequalled Horrors, (not Horrors conjured up, by a gloomy and disteaapeied Imagination, but on every one of which n terrible
reality has been imprinted,) and to hold up to Mankind one ot the most impressive Lessons, one of the most moving Pictures that Time and History era
furnish. In attempting to do this, the Author of the forthcoming Drama, has endeavoured to seize the very Spirit of the Times he would represent; to
delineate Individual Character with the strictest adherence to recorded truth; to depict the most ahVcting, grand and awful Situations which the subject so
abandanliy furnishes; and to display, as far as his feeble Powers will admit, a bold, strong, and animated Picture ej the MOMENTOUS EVENT, ha
proposes to Commemorate.
The Management of the Ito}ul Cobnrg Theatre have been determined to assist his efforts to the very extent of the Ksonrees of a Minor Theatre ;
and humbly hope, that for cemctness cf Costume and picturesque beauty of Scenery, strict attention to Historical Accuracy, and Combination of
Histrionic Talent in the Cast of Character, this Diama will'surpass all those which have before raised the Character of thij Establishment, for the
Production of Historical Dramas, to so high an elevation, and been honored with so 'urge a degree of Public Approbation.

The Overture and Music composed by Mr. T. Hughes.—The Scenery designed and painted by Messrs. Jonei, Damon, and Aili$lanU.—Tne Dresses by
Mr. Smuthert and Mrs. Follett —The properties by Mr. Blamire,—The Machinery by Mr. H. Burroughs.
In Holhnahi ad's Chronicles may be found a Statement of the Pacts of
the horrible occurrence on which this Tragic Drama is founded,—In the Reign
of King Edward the Sixth, AnbMt, a Gentleman of Faverahum, in Kent,
was Assnaainated in his own House, while engaged in a Game of Draughts with
a treaenerone Friend, who auborned two Rumaaa, named, Black Witt and
Shakebag, to the Performance of the most sanguinary Deed that ever stained
the Annals of Rnglish History.—The Tale is still laid in Faver*hni-i, losing
none of its intense Interest from the time elapsed since it happened; a Part of

ARDEN.

A t o m ' s House is standing to this day, and tha carious may be shown the
very Apartment in which the Act was committed; the Abbey Wall still
remains, and the low arched Entrance may be seen, with the aspect of a
black Memorial of a Tale of other times. The Principals, with the Abettors
in the Crime, whera ahortly after executed. The present Piece has bee. considerably altered from L m . o ' s Play on the same subject; the Additions have
been made with historical exactness, and every situation has been heightened,
so that the effect must be at once striking and intense.

bushed to rest, and the People of Europe seem convinced of the blessings t-f a Peaceful Subordination to Legitimate Authority, it has been judged not
-andesireable to hold up to the vi*w of the rising Generation, a Picture of those disastrous and awful Scenes which arose from a contempt of wholesome restraint
iml unlimited Licence of infuriate Passions. In doing this, it has been found necessary to bring together many Events which were separated by considerable
ntervals of Time, but it is hoped that such liberties will he pardoned in favor of au attempt to represent an animated, faithful, and impressive Delineation

TRENOKH
And t h e Revival of the OLD OAK CHEST!!!

T h e above Pieces can be Acted only during the present Week, being the Last Week of Performing before the Easter Holidays.

MONDAY, March 21st, 1825,—TUESDAY, 22d.—THURSDAY, 24th,-And SATURDAY, 26th,

F A T E of CALAS!

And Performed at the Surrey Theatre

upwards of FIFTY NIGHTS with Ihe most unbounded Applause, with New and Appropriate Scenery, Dresses
and Decoration*.
The Murder of Calas committed at Toulouse, by the Hand ot Justice, on the 9th of March, 1772, is one of (he most singular treats which can lie offered
to the attention of the present Age, or of Posterity. In this strange affair, Religion, Suicide and Partictde have been blenHed ; whether a Father and
Mother had Murdered their Son, a Orttlher his Itrother, or a Friend his Friend, whether the Judges hud the guilt of having broken on the Wheel an innocent
Father, or of having sated a guilty Mother, are the important questions which Historical Ktcord submits to the judgment of mankind.—la contests where
the danger si.il, advantage are equal, vur pity is not powerfully challenged, but when the Father of an innocent Family is delivered into the hands of error,
psssion, and fimaticism, if the accused has no defence hut his virtue, if his Judges can murder with impunity, we see that tin msnean huld his life in sny
security before a tribunal blindid by fanaticism, and animated by blood thirsty rage.—It is the awful picture of a sacrifice thus offend up, which the
present Drama presents, and it may be safety pronounced, that a Story more interesting, mora affecting, more impressive, eau scaiceJy appeal to our
sympathies, a Lesson mote fearful, more essential be learned, in the Records of Human Crime and Error.

Conflagration of Laban's Dwelling, and Terrific Earthquake 1
T h e story of the Prodigal Son, one of the moat simply affecting, and morally impressive, that was ever intlired, must necessarily be referred to a
very remote antiquity. The circumstances attending it, are stamped with the manners of Ihe lsruelitish Palri«iehs, and as the history of that whole
people is detailed from the time of Abraham, the events must be anpposed to have occurred even anterior to this era. T > what eouiiny the impetuous Rover
tirected hia steps, ia not mentioned, but aa heia said to have expended his substance in riotous living, and as Egypt was the only country at that time
lequainted with the refinements of luxury k of art, it is natural to fix on Memphis, the capital of that kingdom, aa the scene of the young Debauchee's excesses.
Memphis was at that early period the capital, not only of E g y p t , b u t , as i t may be eaid, of the whole world, all of art, of science, of splendour, or of
Wxury that the world comprised, was concentrated in and confined to that magnificent Metropolis. Some ideaof the ponderotw and demi-reftned magnificence
of those timea, haa been attempted to be depicted in the Pageantry of the above Drama, and as this is necessarily interwoven with some of the almost
lumberless superstitions of the Egyptian Mythology, it becomes almost necessary te explain aome of the prominent objects in the

GRAND

PROCESSION!

As the grand and only sonrce of the fertility and riches nf the land, the Nile has, ever since Egypt was peopled, been the chief object of ihe attention, and
• m adoration of the inhabitants .—ita worship waa universal throughout lha country. Temples were erected oa its batiks, and r'nesls dedicated to the
service of them. I t ia even affirmed by aome writers, that their favorite deity Oairia, (though the name of a King who actually reigned, who conquered
India, and the same with the Greek Bacchus,) is to be considered aa typical of the great River, and his death by the hands of Typhou, to siguily the
swallowing up of the river by Ihe aea.
. . . .
,
The periodical tiaing of lha Nile to that height, when it wnnld overflow w e whole country, and thus fertilize it, was therefore necessarily » subject of
intense anxiety, and waa looked forward t o b y Kings, Plicate, and People with au eagerness of expectation proportioned in the importance of its consequences.
This increase varied considerably, from the proportion that produced a year of complete plenty, to that when absolute famine took place ; and it was
customary therefore to endeavour to propitiate the Deity, who waa supposed to provide over the river by sacrifices; and as Voliair.* asserts, a young and
lea uiit'ul Virgin waa sometimes devoted by their blind and cruel superstition, as the only acceptable ollering to the Cod—-It is the ceremnny of repairing to
he banks of the river at the expected time, and awaiting the. rise of the river to that height, when the Canals and SI aires should be opentd, and conduct the
bounteous stream over the country, that ia represented in the 5th Scene of the 2d Act.—The Hierophant, or ('hief Priest, having from his knowledge of tlie
t-'ciencea divined that the river would be deficient, and having, to gratify his resentment, resolved that the Daughter of the King shall be the chosen sacrifice.

the subsequent feuds amongst the N o b l e s ; the return of Bolingbroke from banishment; his usurpation of the power, and unjust deposition of R i c h a r d ; the
murder of that unfortunate P n n c e in Pomfret Castle; these form a series of
incidents, which furnish to the Dramatist, an ample fund of deep a n d affecting
interest and forcible situations. In condensing this vast mass of historical matter,
involvinga considerablelapseof years, some anachronisms are unavoidable; events,
separated by years, are necessarily brought together, b u t these inaccuracies, it is
hoped, wilt be pardoned, in fuvourof the endeavour to b r i n g u n d e r one view, all

and Appointments, the present Production shall at least equal any o?those which

interesting and affecting Situations and Events, than that occupied by the long

CORSAIRS OF CUBA.
The leading features of this Melo-Dramn are founded on a narrative of
l ireumstances made by an individual named Smith, who took his trial for
Piracy on the High Seas, before the Lords of the Admiralty. In his manly
Uld energetic defence, he painted, with that rude eloquence so peculiarly the
characteristic of a British Sailor, the unparalleled sufferings he endured during
his captivity among the blood-thirsty miscreants who captured the small vessel
be commanded. In the character of Ordonio, an attempt is made to ponrtray
I lie crimes of the Corsican Chieftain, nor is truth sacrificed for dramatic effect;
his errors form a tale of blood, at which humanity must shudder. The life
of their unfortunate prisoner had been often threatened, b»t his skill as a
atfhwr, rendered him so necessary to their purposes, that they refrained from

striking the final blow till the completion of their cruize; fortunately for
Smith, a night of excess and brutal intoxication, afforded an opportunity to
escape, of which he availed himself, in an open boat, exposed to the
dangers of the ocean; he succeeded in gaining a British Colony, was recognized
as a Pirate, and conveyed to Kngland, Here the Providence that ever
'* Sits tip aloft to keep watch o'er ifle life of poor Jack" saved that of
Smith, he was honorably acquitted. The Pirate's haunt Iteing discovered,
an English Frigate was commissioned to destroy them, who to the hut
defended themselves with the greatest intrepidity; so much so, that out ot
a crew of sixty persons, ten alone remained alive, or unwounded, to meet the
just reward of Murderers, A D E A T H OF INFAMY.

To-morrow is our wedding day, and we will then repair

Scene 1.—An Apartment

in Gilpin's

House.

1'reparations for an early start,—all alive from top to bottom,—-agog for a bit
of pleasure,—a b i t of intrigue likely to take place a t the same time, which
will a d d greatly to the pleasure of some of t h e party,—frugal arrangement)!
for the benefit both of the purse and the internals*
Q u o t h Mrs. Gilpin that's well said,
And for that wine is dear,
We will b e furnished with our own,
Which is both bright and clear.
J o h n Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife.
U'erjoyed WRS h*» to find.
T h a t though on pleasure she was b e n t ,
She had a frugal mind.

Away went hat and wig;
Away went Gilpin, who b u t he,
His fame soon spread a r o u n d ;
H e carries weights, he rides a race,
' T i s for a thousand pound.
Ar.d in a trice the turnpike men
T h e i r gates wide open threw.

WASH.

Keeping it up,—throwing o u t ballast,—making wine and water wholesale,—
stick t o the point,—nothing like it,—water can't cool his courage.
And now as he went bowing down,
His reeking head full low;
T h e bottles twain behind his back,
W e r e shattered at a blow.
T h u s all through merry Islington
2.—Outside of Gi/pin's House.
These gambols he did play,
All arranged and off we go,—-Passengers booked for the inside,—only one And till he came unto tlie wash

Seized fast the flowing mane,
Arrival of the first division o f t h e party,—joined by an uninvited guest,—
And u p he got in haste to ride,
playing a t bo-peep, and preparing to astonish the old ones,—Johnny no fl incher,

For why? his owner had a house, full ten miles off, at W a r e .
T o make his balance true.

6.—The Callender*s House at Ware.

3—ISLINGTON.
Expectations of pleasure sometimes disappointed,—disasters to some of t h e
party,—an unpleasant t u r n out, b u t the weakest must go t o the wall,-—going
t o b e married in style,—on appropriate and characteristic equipage,—London
horsemanship,—warming o n the subject, [and getting into the spirit of tlie
thing.
B u t finding soon a smoother road,
Beneath his well-shod feet,
T h e snorting beast began t o trot,
W h i c h galled him in his seat.
S o fair and softly, J o h n he cried.
B u t J o h n he cried in vain;
T h a t trot became a gallop soon,
I n spite of c u r b and rein.
So stooping down, as needs he must,
W h o cannot sit upright,
H e grasped the mane with both his hands,
A n d eke with all his might.

Unexpected meeting of friends,—come to a stand stilt a t last,—game t o t h e
back bone,—not to b e conquered,—refitting, and determined t o start again.
T h e Callender amazed to see his friend in such a trim,
And stop and eat, for well you may, b e in a hungry case;
Said J o h n it is m y wedding day, and all the world v-ould stare,
If wife should dine at Edmonton and I should dine at W a r e .
So t u r n i n g to his horse lie said, I am in haste to dine,
' T w a s for your pleasure, I came liere, you shall go bock for mine.
A n d gollop'd off, with all his might, as he had done before.

7.— The Bell at Edmonton.

P a r t of the day's business accomplished, a n d some of the party gratified,—
more people's wedding day than two,—there & back again,—an unsympathizing

K r W l j e n the French Usurper anil his Armies had been finally expelled
f em Spain, by the splendid career of Victory of the British Army, aided b y
•he heroic and u w o n u u e r a h l e National Spirit of the Spaniards, the Legitimate
M march, Ferdinand A l l , was restored t o his throne; a n d shortly afterwards,
a Constitution, founded, in some measure, -upon that which ferma the pride
and Ntpptnew of the British Inlands, and which had been formed by the very
4 lortda or National Assembly, under whose Government the libertiesof Spain
and the restoration of her Monarch had been atchieved, was solemnly accepted
by Ferdinand, and sworn to by him, as the basis and rule of his Government.
In the course of u few years, however, t h e advice o f wicked Ministers, a u d
Hit* machination* of the Priests, had made such inroads upon this National
Charter, that it could scarcely IK- said to exist, even in name, and Spain was
reduced to a state of M o n a r c h a l and Priestly Despotism, endurable only in a
d irkeued and barbarous Age. I t was then, that the heroic spirit of a Nation,
that had bought her liberties at t h e expeuce of so m u c h blood, again b u r s t
forth, ami kindled by the breath of P A T R I O T S like R I E G O and Q U I R O G A ,
started u p into an universal flame of freedom and independence. T h e C o n s: button was proclaimed anew in a l l t h e principal towns, it was hailed with
A •• UmatioiM by the Army mid the P e o p l e ; i t s enemies were compelled t o
retire from the Administration of affairs, anil the Monarch once more swore to
maintain it, and receive
t h i s friends, the friends of the people. T h i s happy

state of things did not last l o n g ; the rational and moderate Freedom of t h e
Spaniards was viewed with jealousy b y a neighbouring C o u r t , and an invading
Army of overwhelming numbers was poured into Spain, with t h e avowed
purpose of annihilating the Constitution and restoring t h e absolute power of
the Monarch. I t was then that the spirit of her Patriots was p u t t o the teat,
and after a fruitless b u t heroic effort to resist the tyrannic power of foreign
and domestic Enemies, some of these devoted men S E A L E D
THEIR
M A R T Y R D O M W I T H T H E I R B L O O D , whilst others have sought
and found a refuge in the never Jailing humanity of the British
Nation.
I t is the Exploits of these gallant men, their misfortunes and their fate,
which the above D r a m a professes to represent, and to do this accurately, no
coat o r industry have been spared, in procuring the most accurate Authorities,
many of which have been furnished b y Persons who were eye witnesses of t h e
transactions, and partakers in the glorious struggle. T h e Managers therefore,
h u m b l y hope, that this Piece will prove, as accurate, as licefci and as impressive
a Representation
of Ei>entst as has ever been offered in a n E N G L I S H
T H E A T R E ; a n d surely, no subject can claim a warmer sympathy from the
feelings -of Britons, than the picture o f a few disinterested and high-souled
Put riots, stniggliug against Foreign Annies and Domestic T y r a n t s , especially
when we consider that many of these Victims of the untoward vicissitudes o r
human affair*, a r e now thankfully eating the Bread of B R I T I S H B O U N T Y ! ' !

First Night of New Historical Trgie Dramn, and New Serio Pantomime.—Second \\ tek of the I iviii" Skeleton.
Continued and Increasing Success of that Awful fii>cvtacle, the lititninq of the Kent.
*yTh«t "t may adihit of a Question, whether the " LIVING SKELETON," inhibited at the L'oburg Theatre, has, or a n not the advantage over hit
Cotemporory in point of Flesh, it is allowed on all hands that he vastly excels htm in Spirit ; and that, wliclher or not, hiB Adicrsary displays the greater
Perfection of Bone, it is abundantly evident, that it is at the Coburg Theatre only, tfc« Public must look lor the Pith and Marrow if the Subject.
It may be necessary to cairn the Apprehensions of the Public, us to tlie erne! and artificial means by which so extraordinary tin Apjienrance. is said to be
produced, to assure them, tliat the LIVING SKELETON here presented to their Notice, has nut been reduced to that condition by Sudorific* or Starvation,
but it, as his only fellow Creature professes to be, exactly as Nature made him, and Kats daily as much as Nature re |Uirc*.

" Nothing iu the World is single," has been said of Yore. To imagine there is but one man living in glorious independence of flesh, sustaining himself
like an Ivory Turner, solely upon bone, would be to foil into a great error. Without wishing to detract from the meritorious leanness of an elevated gentleman, who at present engrosses so much of the public notice, the Managers of the Cobnrg feel compelled to declare, that they have procured, at an
IMMENSE E X P E N C E , another Candidate for all the tpare honors which are not irrevocably accorded to a Rival, who, by throwing his bono in the
fece of the world, has gained its patronage and applause.—The Skeleton of the Coburg, although he may share the greatness at being equally tmaJl with
his Cotemporary, does not arrogate to himself alone the fame of his appearance, inasmuch as all considerate people must discover, that a Skeleton is a joint
concern,although it may be connected with »« body—The homely proverb saith, " Beauty is but skin deep,"—just so much beauty hath the Skeleton in
question, being wholly divested of.all those deformities which " flesh is heir to."—The Managers of the Coburg Theatre, with that assiduity to bring forth
retiring merit, which they trust has ever marked their career, considering it unworthy the dignity of their Skeleton to be viewed as a mere passive machine,
or lile a Tee-totum set a going by any Visitor, have introduced this " Outline of a Man," in a Spectacle, written expressly to display his peculiar talents.

(O* To the history of a men who has playtd so important a part in the
grand drama of human existence, as was sustained by the Warrior above
named, a peculiar interest is attached ; the intensity of which is augmented
by the intimate relations which almost every event of his life had with our own
foreign and domestic policy. But, with however eager a decree of curiosity
we may trace the history of battles lost or won.—-or follow the career of the
Adventurer from early obscurity through the bright path of Victory to the
splendour of a Throne, and a degree of power scarcely ever equalled,—tl« interest felt in his fate will not be terminated with his exploits and his triumphs,
b« t will cling with equal force to his reverses and his downfall: a feeling approaching to sympathy will carry our enquiries to his moments of misfortunes,
the scenes of his humiliation, and will perhaps survey with redoubled interest
hit last moments. It is not without a thri U of national exultation, that we can
v\(& the chosen Child of Victory vanquished by the valour of our Countrymen,
and approach, as a Captive, those Shores which he once vainly threatened to
tread as a conqueror ;—it is not, perhaps, without a sigh of pity that we can
buhojd him groan his last in a distant clime, far from all those whose affeo-

t innate endearments might disarm the King of Terrors of his scorpion stray.—•
The Drama now submitted to the indulgence of the Pubhc has been prepared
with the express view of delineating with the utmost accuracy that laborious
research could furnish, and with every degree of vivid reality that unlimited
expence and intense industry could attain, this last and interesting period* of
the life of so celebrated a character; and it is confidently offered to the Public
as an exact delineation of every occorrenee that hefel, and of the reflections,,
sentiments, actions,, and even the very expressions of its hero, from the moment
of his Flight from Waterloo, to that of his Death at St. Helena. In doing
this, every care has been taken to avoid all political allusions that could be
obnoxious to national or individual feeling ; and to present a picture of regent
events, at once interesting, affecting, and impressive, and destitute of eveCy
tendency that could give birth to an objection. Every department of the
Theatre has been for many weeks most assiduously employed ; and the die\.Uy
of Scenery and Machinery will be found more varied, extensive, and picturesque, tlxm ever was comprised in one dramatic Spectacle.

K I N G OF HAYTI.

The forcible manner in which the Public attention has, by recent occurrences been called to the affairs of the Newly recognized Kingdom of Hayti, the
anxiety with which the present situation of that State is universally viewed, and the probability which exists that it may shortly again become the Theatre of
thoae terrible commotion, which attended its first organisation as an Independent Nation, cannot but attach a peculiar Interest to those event, which accompanied
the first struggle made by a Negro Population for a municipal Freedom, and which are so powerfully illustrated in the above Popular Drama. This
Intesest cannot but be considerably heightened by the Personation of the principal Character by an Actor of the same race and complexion aa the sable
Hero himself, and under these combined circumstances the Managers feel confident that the Piece will now be Revived with a degree of favor at least equal
to that with which it was honored on its first Production.

BURMESE
J ^ T b e immense importance attached to all that concerns our spacious and
valuable Empire in the East i n d i e s , no less than its being the only Theatre of
British Valour and Military Skill since the general pacification of Europe, has
rendered the present conflict with the Burmese an object of intense interest to
all Classes of Society; whilst t h e peculiarities of a People hitherto so little
kwrfrn, and as to whom the rapid progress of o u r Annies through their
T s W t o r y is daily procuring Irish information excites that lively curiosity which
every new phenomenon of natural and especially H u m a n History cannot fail
to create. T h e purpose of the forthcoming Drama therefore is not only t o
represent and commemorate the brilliant Atchicvements of our valiant Troops,
b u t also to display the singular Costume, Manners, peculiar mode of Attack,
Defence and lortifieution, rude Magnificence, and National Character of a
people in a more lively and impressive way than the Pen of the Historian can

WAR!!!
attain. T h e subject affords every possible scope for the advantages of Dramatic
Representation, and the resources of a Theatre, which will b e unsparingly
lavished on this occasion, and perhaps t h e concluding feature of this Piece,
the Massacre of Ruialtpoor is from the immediate Horrors of the Scene no less
than from the vivief picture it conveys o f the Ferocity, Treachery, and C r u e l t y
of a m Barbarous Enemy calculated to produce as powerful a Dramatic effect,
as any Historic Event ever produced on the Stage. T h e Scenery and Dresses
are all copied from Drawings taken on the Spot, and every part of the A p p e n dages of the D r a m a , are prepared from an assiduous collation of t h e best
Authorities. From motives of delicacy, fictitious names have been substituted
for those of the Gallant Officers whs have so successfully conducted o u r
Military Operations.

T m ' D r a m a t i c Spectacle of the B U R N I N G of the K E N T , representing the most awful Calamity incidental to H u m a n i t y , and abounding with S i t u ationi of the most high wrought Interest and affecting Pathos, and universally allowed t o be the nearest approach t o reality, and the most powerful Illusion
ever attained on any Stage, has been so frequently and anxiously enquired for, by many of the numerous frequenters of this T h e a t r e , that the Manager is
induced to Revive that highly popular Drama, for S I X N I G H T S O N L Y .
T b e M e t o - D r a m a , founded on the principal Incidents of the B U R M E S E W A R , haw proved one nf the most effective and successful Military Spectacles
ever produced at this Theatre. It would be superfluoas to insist at greater length on its Merits and Popularity ; b u t , the great exertion requisite for the arduous
Character of " P A U L P R Y , " renders it impossible for Mr. U A V I D G E t o Perform in any other Piece during the run of that very successful Burletta.
D u e Notice will be given of the next Representation of the Burmese W a r .
" P A U L P R Y " dropt in at this Theatre, for the First T i m e on Monday Evening, on which occasion, a n d on each succeeding Evening, he has been
received with such rapturous Acclamations of Applause and Roars of Laughter that he is determined to continue lus Intrusions till further Notice.

In HoUitmhc-urs Chronicle may '*- found a Statement of the Farts of tlte
iiortihte occurrence on which this Tragic Drama is found)M.— In the Reign of
King Edward the Sixth. ARDBN. a Gentleman of F<tver»ham, in Kent, was
assassinated in his own House, while engaged in a Game of Draughts with a
treacherous Friend, who suborned Two Ruffians, named Hi. At K \\ t r.i. and
SMAKKHAO, to the Performance of tin.- most sanguinary Deed that ever stained
HR- Annals of English History.—The Tale is stilt told in Faverahnm, losing
none of its intense Interest from the time elapsed since it happened; a Part of

Faversham.

ARDEN'S House is standing to this day, and the curious may lie shewn the
very Apartment in which the Act was committed; the Abbey Wall still remains,
and tin- low arched Entrance may be seen, with the aspest of a black Manorial
of a Tale of other times. The Principal*, with the Abettors in the Crime,
were shortly after executed. TJ*e present Piece has been considerably altered
from LILI.O'S Play on the same subject; the Additions have been made with
historical exactness, and every situation has been heightened, so that the effect
must be at once striking and intense.

W i n offering to the Public a New Dramatic Version of the very highly popular Novel of GUY MANNERING, an attempt has been made to attach to
such a production a feature of novelty which might afford a new interest to the subject, and heighten its dramatic effect. With this view, the early
history of its principal characters, and the Various striking incidents connected with it, have been interwoven into the drama, a change which has
necessitated one of those bold transitions in point of time, which, though unusual, are not new to the drama. The indulgence af the public is therefore
requested for AN INTERVAL O F S E V E N T E E N YEARS, supposed to elapse between the First and Second Acti.
In the course of the Piece will he introduced the following favorite
PIECES of MVSIC:
Ol.EE,—"The Chough *>rf Grow."

(Biimapiiak

The dreadful effects of the pernicious VICK or G AMINO, arc constantly ottered to observation in occurrences of the most distressing, sometimes of die
most horrible description; the impression of transactions of the most atrocious die has scarcely been erVaecd by time, when RECENT OCCURRENCES again
forcibly draw the attention to the consequences of the prevailing rage for this destructitc pursuit.—The Impptuess, the honor, the properties of families,
sometimes life itself, are the sacrifices it demands; whilst those of the highest Rank and the most princely wealth, are driven to tempo retry banishment m the
hopes of retrieving the dismal fosses occasioned by this madness.—TrnuuKtious of the passing moment in the highest Cirr/es hare fixed the public attention
>aui on this subject, and have induced those, who would ever wish to muke the Stage B School of Moral Instruction^ to hrin# forward a Drama in which
tiieae Scenes are forcibly illustrated, and which depicts in the most powerful and affecting maimer tlte circumstances occasioned by a vice, which is
< < instantly a source of the most poignant distress.

K ^ I H offering to the P u b l i c a New D r a m a t i c Version ofthe very highly populur Novel of G U Y M A N N E I U N G , an attempt has been made to attach to
such a production a feature of novelty which might aHbrd a new interest to the subject, and heighten its dramatic effect. W i t h this view, the early history
of its principal characters, and the various striking incidents connected w ith it, have been interwoven into the drama, a change which has necessitated one
of those bold transitions in point of time, which, though unusual, are new to the druma. T h e indulgence of the P u b l i c is therefore requested for
AN I N T E R V A L O F S E V E N T E E N Y E A R S , supposed to elapse bettceen the First and Second Acts.

atrocious Cliannrter perpetually oecariaK in a particular quarter of Paris, and the total failure .1 every ellort to detect tl»> Murderers, gave rise to the belief
that a formidable baiat of Humuna, skilfully organised, ina-sted tla- City and occasioned a uttiveraal Panic. The vigilance of the Tribunal, at length tra. rd
tl« whole tissue of atrocities tn one Criminal, and that otte, a man whose rank in society, w, a! th, ami reputation, rendered him the very last object of suspicion.
He was enabled to perpetrate his diabolic acts by means of a private communication from his own house to the ruins of an ancient Mouutry. Such are the

8? Tins Piece, though of most peculiar construction, boasts also a peculiar mid very powerful interest. A high military enthusiasm is most happily united

THE PHANTOM SHIP.

" T H E FLYING D U T C H M A N " is said to be an Amsterdam Vessel, which about a Century ago sailed from that Port;—the Master's Name was
I'uiirtV rdVc&m, whose constunt Boast it was, that "he always* would have his own Wuy, in spite of the Devil."
Once, on doubling-tbeCnpe, they were awholeDay trying to weather Table Ba^.theWind encreasinfr a-headof them, andVanderdecken walking theDeck,
continued swearing fearfully. Just after Sun-set, he was spoke to by a Vessel, who asked him if he did not mean to go into the Bay that Night, to which
VANDERDKCKEN, with a. tremendous Oath, replied, "he would not, though he should lieut about till the Day of Judgment." VANDERDECKEN never did
go into Table Bay, and is believed to undergo the doom he so desperately dared. His Vessel is still seen in the Cape Seas in foul Weather, sailing against
the fiercest Storm*, w ith every inch of Canvas set, striving in vain to reach her Home, or to send Dispatches to Relatives by other Vessels.

g-»In offering to the Public « New Dramatic Version of the very highly popular Novel ofGUY' MANNERING, an attempt has been made to attach to
such a production a feature of novelty which might afford a new interest to tin; subject, and heighten its dramatic crt'eot. With this view, the early history
of it, principal Characters, arid the various striking incidents connected with it, have been interwoven into the Dra.ua, a change which has necssitul.sl one
of those bold transition* in point of time, which, though unusual, are not new to the Drama. The indulgence of the Public is therefore requested lor

pen against that destructive vice, and never perhaps h a t e its consequences bern riourtrayed in so strong a light, the wretchedness, guilt, and despair which arise
from it been so vividly illustrated as in this D r a m a . I t professes to represent the life of a Gamester, h u t , as it is impossible to present on the Stage, in a con*

T l w peculiar construction of the above Piece, and the extraordinary concentration of Talent it requires, hare induced the Manager, notwithstanding the

fc^Thls Piece, which has since the middle of J u n e , been nightly represented to crowded Audiences a t the Theatre o f P o r t e St. Martin, as Parit, h a t excited
• stronger sensation in that Capital than any Melo-Draina that lias been produced there for some years. T h e frightful extent to which the rag* for G a m i n g
ha* spread in that City, and the fatal results to which it too often leads, have, apparently, induced the highly talented A u t h o r to direct the utmost force ofhi*
fienagoinst that destructive vice, and never perhaps hare its conseo, uenees been pourtrayed in so strong a light, the wretchedness, guilt, and despair which arise
from it been so vividly illustrated as in this Urania. I t professes to represent the life of a Gamester, b u t , as it is impossible to present on the Stage, in a continuous series, the transactions of so long a period, the occurrences' of Four and T w e n t y hours at different periods of his life, separated by intervals of Fifteen
I .nts, constitute each Act or P a r t of the Drama, which, it is confident!* anticipated, will be found one of the most powerfully interesting and impressive, erer
transferred from tire French to the English Stage.
,
T h e peculiar construction of the a b o - e Piece, and the extraordinary concentration of Talent it requires, h a r e induced the Manager, notwithstanding the
great Strength of the Company, t» engage Mr. H U N T L E Y for this particular occasion, in order that a Drama of so much merit may receive every possible
degree of effect, and lie supported by that uniform excellence of Acting of which it is worthy.

G r a n d D i o r a m a , representing the iwgeof M o n t S t . G o t h a r d ,
In the (anion of Uri, which commands the whole of Switzerland, and which was carried by Field Marshal Suwarrow,
against the French under General Lecourbe. on the 24th of September, 1799.
Intfircentrroftlw*Picture, stands the Field Marshal, in the dress he usually wore,
a boot mi one If g, & . t>lip|>er on the other. He is taking an Oath before Heaven,
that "if he doe* not conquer the French la this Spot tohuryhiiiiM-lffbr ever in the
deepest OuVern of tin- Mountains." A Priest on his knees is listening to this
tow, and praying fur its acceptance. Immediately behind htm, stuuds Suwitrrow's favorite Cossack, holding his Master's Horse ; and close to his back are
two Cossack Officers* To the left of them is u Russtan Regiment, supjiorted
by Cossacks, advancing to strengthen the Force on the Bridge. Then appears
the Camp fiqutpuge of Suwurrow, borne by Mules. In their rear, the remainder of the Russian Army is seen coming forward, idler having already sustained
* severe contest, in which Colonel Stimuli was wounded.—-As we ascend the
Mountain towards the Glaciers, which are distinguished by their white and
spiral tops, we see a small Alpine Bridge tilled with French Soidkrs: and onward
to the right, one of tbiMff hospitable religious Houses, which in these wild regions
supply tht* phue uf Inns.—To the right of the centre, and close to Suwurrow,
stands the Grand Duke Constantitie, (a Son of the late Eni|>eror Haul's) and
Prince Andir GuiUhetoH : an Officer is hastening towards them for order*.

General Mitomdovitch, with hi* hand wounded, is leading up the Russian
Grenadiers;and Prince Ba^t-ation, mounted on u White Charger, i s animating
a large body of (Cossacks with their Commander* at their head. The entrance
of It Ponttl'u />wA/e, or the Devil's Bridge, the tremendous Pass to be disputed,
IN tilled with RnsHiun Troops. A wounded Field Officer is supported from the
ground by two Soldiers, General en Chef Perffelden Rosenberg on Horseback,
is giving directions to Major Ivanow. In the centre of the Bridge, thebattla
ntgei with the greatest fury.—General Gudin, one of the most formidable of
the French Leaders, and two other Field Officers, are in t lie thickest of the con*
test; and General tluspiui with his horse, is precipitated over the Bridge* Along
the ridge of the Mountains parallel with h Pont 4u Diabte, th* French Troops
led on by General Lecou-be, lin»* the Rocks:—He stands amidst his Aid-deCamps making observations. Mont St. Gothurd rises in immense grandeur
over their head*:—-A ltd fartothe right, stretches the luxuriant Valley of Ruesse,
envered with verdure, and enriched with populace towns. The small Chapel
of the illustrious William Tell, is the last building in sight; and the Lake of
Lucerne, bounded by the Mouth Mytein and Hoggen, mark the Horizon.

The whole to conclude with, bv most particular desire,

MONDAY, AUGUST 11th, 1828, AND DURING THE WEEK,
At a QimrttT-past Six will be exhibited,, painted by D ANSON, a New

G r a n d D i o r a m a , representing ^Passage of M o n t S t . G o t h a r d ,
In the Canton of Uri, which commands the whole of Switzerland, and which was carried by Field Marshal Suwarrow,
against the French under General Lecourbe, on the 24th of September, 1799
In tl*'centre oft he Picture, stands the Field MarshaUinthedressheusually wore,
a bootononeleg, & a slipperonlheother. He is taking an Oath before Heaven,
that "if he does not conquer theFrench in thisSpottobury himself for ever in the
deepest Cavern of the Mountains." A Priest on his knees is listening to this
vow, and prayiug for its acceptance. Immediately behind him, stands Suwarn n ' i faterite Cossack, holding his Master's Horse; and close to his back are
two Coasack Officers. To the left of them is a Russian Regiment, supported
by CoHacks, advancing to strengthen the Force on the Bridge. Then appears
the Camp Equipage ofsawarrow, borne by Mules. In their rear, the remainder of the Russian Army is seen coming forward, after having already sustained
a severe contest, in which Colonel Straueh was wounded.—As we ascend the
Mountain towards the Glaciers, which are distinguished by their white and
spiral tops, we seeasmall Alpine Bridge tilled with French Soldiers: and onward
to the right, oue of tlawe hospitable religious I louses, which in these wild regions
supply the place of Inns.—To the right of the centre, and clow to Suwarrow,
stands the Grand Duke Constantino, (a Son of the late Emperor Paul's) and
Prince Andre Gartchetorf: an Officer is hastening towards tlrem for orders.

General Mitorndovitch, with his hand wounded, is leading up .the Russian
Grenadiers; and Prince Bagratioti, mounted on a White Charter, is animating
a large body of Cossacks with their Commanders at their head. The entrance
of le Pont du Diabte, or the Devil's Bridge, the tremendous Pass to la.* disputed,
is filled with Russian Troops. A wounded Field Officer is supported from the
ground by two Soldiers. General eu Chef PertfeWen Rosenberg <HI Horseback,
is giving directions to Major Ivanow. In the centre of the Bridge, the battle
mges with the greatest fury.—General Gudin, one of tile most formidable of
tiw French Leaders, ami two otla'r Field Officers, are in ihe thickest ol the contest; and General Ruspini with his horse, is precipitated over the Bridge. Along
the ridge of the Mountains parallel with /*• Pont au Diable, the French Troops
led on by General Lecourbe, line the Rocks:—He stands amidst his Aid-deCaiups, making observations. Mont St. Gothard rises in immense grandeur
over their heads:—And far to the right, stretches the luxuriant Valley of H uesse,
covered with verdure, anil enriched with populace towns. The smalt ('Impel
of the illustrious William Tell, is the last building in sight; and the Lake of
Lucerne, bounded by tla- Moots My tern and Hoggen, mark the Horizou.

necessary to state, in order to prevent future mistakes, that no " Shilling Box Orders" are admitted at the

for some time past, had an Audience of from Sixteen to Eighteen Thousand Individuals Weekly, there were
but few Play going Persons who had not already visited his Establishment; he is, however, happy to find
from the Announcement of the Surrey Bills, that there are yet numerous Parties anxious to attend his
Theatre, and hereby gives notice, that the Coburg is placed in a line with Waterloo Bridge, where Orders
will continue to be received, the Proprietor of the Coburg notbavitig copied the example of a Contemporary
in having such Orders printed, and then of subsequently putting them aside for further consideration previous

STORY.

The Melo*Drama is fonnihd ttpon an Historical Fact in the Keigtt of greatly in that circumstance. What 1 am now gr'wg to t* 11 you, I learned
Queen Anne. Ambrose Gwinett was innocently accused, condemned, and from my Brother, which was that, after having hung about ha\J uu hour, the
executed tor the Murder of a Person "who tltui uu.m uuntably disappeared ; t h e Sheriff •» Office's all went off, and 1 was t u t down by the Eteeuiiouer, but
weapon of the supposed Victim was found in the hand of t>wittelt', every cir- whru he came to put the irons upon me, it v a * fouud n mistake had been made,
cumstance that could criminate a man arose against htm, and he was supposed ami that the irons of the ollu r man, which * t i c much too large tor me, hud
to have been executed,—Gwinett thus desctibes, in his homely way, the Scene been sent instead of mine, this they remedied as we'd as drey could, by sttiffii.tr
on the Scaffold— * for my own p a r t my mind, [Heaven help u i e ) was with cloths between my body and the hoops tlntl Bilvroniohd it ; after which I wa:
ling agitation become so unfeeling, that I was In a manner insensible to every t a k n i ucf-riling to my sentence lu the place appointed, and hung upon a
object about roe; I therefore heard the Sheriff whisper the Executioner to G . h h n , which was ready prepared; the cloth ov«i my Sum b u n g slight-y tied,
tnake what dispatch he could, without the least i motion, and suffered him t - and suffering no pressure from the iron, which 9to< d a great way fr. m ll, was,
ti« me to the fatal Beam, unconscious of what he was doing.—I can give no 1 suppose, soon detached by the wind, which was still rather violent, and
account of myself whUe 1 was hanging, only that I remember, after being probably its Mowing on my bare face e x p e d i t e d my recovery; certain it is,
tutted off, something for awhile appeared about rnc like a blutte of tire, nor do tout in this tremeudoui situation, i came to royselt."—The atlei-lale uf the

This Dramatic Satire after hieing hid the most brilliant Career ofThirty
Nights, has, if possible, gained
in point of Attraction.
In accordance with the Proprietor's general determination of rapid succession of Novelty, the Piece must notwithstanding be
partially withdrawn ; when however the great social benefits are considered to which it has given rise, and as much good may yet remains io be done, the Prai
arietor feels it his duty to repeat it every Thursday Night until further Notice.

THIRTY

YEARS

OF JL DRUJVKJlRB's

LIFE!

Tie immense advantages that resulted from the thrilling Representation of a late Melo-Drama, in which were developed the frightful eifects of th« career of
a Gambler, have induced the Proprietor to attempt, in the Production about to be represented, a fearful display of the innumerable Evils that wait upon the
Habits ef a Drunkard. Diunkenness, like Play, presents a thousand lamentable instances of the Prestation of Human Intellect; the Destruction of
Families ; the total Degradation of Man from s sphere ef reasonable Creatures. It will be the endeavour of the Author of the Piece in question, to throw a
veil over the more disgusting properties of Inebriety, and whilst the dreadful effects of the Vice are pourtrayed with a vivid power, its repulsive features will
be carefully thrown into the shade; it is hoped that the Piece will not be less favorably received on the score of its being no importation.

" The Drink, the Drbik,"—Huiiilt1.

F I F T E E N TEARS OF A DRUNKARDS L I F E !
The Firat Representation of an entirely New & Original Melo-Drama, of the most peculiar St thrilling interest; • Production, which, while it is calculated to
wnusr, cannot but impress on the Auditor a deep Moral Lesson, illustrative of the manifold Evils of Inebrity, us strikingly represented throughput the
varied Scenes of the Production. Philosophers, Poets, and Essay Writers have combined to place the Stigrua of Reproach and Infamy on the Vice of
Intoxication, a Vice which gradually, yet surely saps the Foundation of the Understanding, destroys every lieu I thful emotion, and ultimately degrades its
Victim, Man, "the Paragou of Animals," to the lowest standard of breathing Creatures. It has beeu hitherto reserved for the Dramatist to display, by a
powerful Grouping of events, (the natural consequences Of lutoiicatiou) the appalling hideousuus. of the Vice, to bold the Minor up to this part Of
degraded nature, and, if possible, shame it from a continuance of Evil, l>y the Renectiou of its own Deformity.

Thi* Piec* conUini Scenes of the most highly wrought Character t a
derelopeinent of circumstances which may fairly be 'nferred, (is the mttitrnl
results of proneness to inebrity, a frightful series of horrors aiising from the
seductive, but destructive cup of the Bacchanal, the dissipated life of the
infatuated man of rank and education is contrasted with the intemperance of
the mere uncultivated Rustic, the really excellent qualities of either individual are shewn as availing nothing against the poisonous blandishments of
drink ; both parties are led on from ill to ill, until at length they are plunged
into an overwhelming sea of guilt and horror, and leave behind them a memory

of tlie blackest infamy. In order to produce the desired effect, the Dramatist
has availed himself of an allowable licence, that of spreading; his work oyer a
long term of years ; thus the degraded state of either victim will be shewn with
utnofetotlching force, and all the sad varieties of the vice brought into one focus;
it is this crowding together of evil which forms the powerful moral of **Hogarth* M GIB Lone," and wttiuh, it is hoped, will render " Fifteen Years of a
Drunkard's Life" worthy of a very general and tasting patronage,'---(The

M O N D A Y , J U L Y 6lh, 1829, and D u r i n g the Week,
A t Half-past 6 precisely will be presented, an entirely New Melo-Drama, in T h r e e Acts, of peculiar interest, written b y M r . J . B . B U C K S T O N E , founded
upon Incidents in the Life of Eugene Frmcoii
Vidocq, the Secret Agent of the French Police, a n d which will be produced, with entirely New Music,
Scenery, Machinery, Dresses and Decorations, to b e called,

Vidocq, the French Thief-Taker!
Music b y M r . T . Hughes.—Scenery by M r . Damon & Assistants.—Properties by Mr- Eallett.—Machinery by M r . Dnrson.—Dresses by M r . Saunders & M r s . Follett.
T h e above Drama is offered to the Public as combining features of entire Novelty & singular Interest. The manners k peculiarities" of our Neighbours & Rivals, the
French, have always excited, in an intense degree, the curiosity of our Countrymen, and have, therefore, frequently been exhibited for their amusement on the Stage.
The present production, however, penetrates into those remote recesses of Society, those dark, mysterious, and sometimes appalling transactions, which are only
impervious to ordinary means of observation, b u t which possess features of the most thriBing iuterest, the m i s t harrowing pathos. T h e Heio of the Piece, is himself
one of the most singular and interesting characters, that have, in this eventful s g e , appeared on the Theatre of public affairs in Europe. Af.er an adventurous career
as C O N V I C T , BAR H I T , S O L D I K R , and C I T I Z E N , he became the principal and confidential Agent of that formidable body the French Police; at once the Defealer of a
Burglary, the Detector of mighty Conspiracies. Such opportunities of diving into the mysteries of I »FK I S A G R E A T C A P I T A L have fallen to the lot of few; no rank so
elevated as to be beyond his access, none so humble as to b e unworthy his notice, none so concesled as to elude his penetrating vigilance, 'I he Memoirs of no Hero
that ever lived, are, perhaps, so pregnant with infoimation, interest, and amusement i and it is believed, few Dramas have ever been more remarkable for the same
qualities than the present. It has been produced with the most scrupulous anxiety to place before the Public a I IVIMO P I C T U R E O F T H E EVENTS I T D E L I N E A T E S .

Properties

This Piece has been prepared, principally with a view to introducing, in a Novel manner, the Astonishing Performances
of the Wonderful GERMAN GYMNASIAST, which it has been thought desireable to interweave with a stronger degree of
Interest, and a species ot Incidents of a Grander Style, than those which have usually formed the subject matter of similar
Sketches. In connecting this peculiar species of Talent, with Historical Transactions of the first importance, and the deepest
interest, every posssible care lias been taken not to violate probabilities, or to require too wide a Stretch of imagination, and
also to impart that degree of reality to the Scenic representation of important Naval and Military Events which has so often
before honorably characterized this Establishment.

In Three Acts, partly founded on a celebrated Dramatic Poem, by Lord Byron, and partly on a French Tragic Drama, which has for tome Months
been the leading feature of Attraction in Paris. The extraordinary sensation excited by this powerful effort of Genius in the French Metropolis, has
induced the Manager to have it adapted with the greatest care to the English Stage. It will be produced with entirely New and Splendid Local Scenery
and New Dresses, and with every degree of attention, in the hope of rendering ;it an object of it much interest and admiration in this as it has been in
another Country.

founded partly on L»rd Byron's Celebrated Tragedy of M A R I N O F A I i I E K O . the Doge of Venice, and partly on the popular FrtnfcH D r a m a of Ihe

The extraordinary and strongly exciting incidents connected with the Life
of the Doge, Marino Faiiero, otter materials to the Dramatic Poet of tempting
capability. Accordingly,one of the most gigwntie Geniuses that ever illumined
the Hemisphere of British Dramatic Poesy has chosen it for the sttbjeet, of,
perhaps, the most powerful effort that ever emanated from his pen. L O R D
BYRON having thought proper to adapt tins Poem expressly for the CioBet
rather than the Stage, its prolixity and untheatrical arrangement, notwithstanding it abounds in passages of power and brilliancy unequalled b y any
writer of the present day, have prevented it being acceptably ottered to the
Public in a Theatrical Representation. So splendid a subject, however, was
not destined to want that lively form of delineation ; *be outline drawn by Our
own inspired P o e t , has been eagerly seized b y an ingenious writer of the rival
kingdom ; for several months has the Drama of Munn. C A S S I M I B D E L A V I G N V.
been the chief point of attraction in Paris ; and though it has passed the 60th

Representation, it continues Nightly to draw the most crowded Audience**
and to form the chief topic with the literary circles of the French Metropolis;
These circumstances have forcibly drawn to tl»e subject the attention of the
present writer, who begs to apologize to the master Spirits with whom he hit*
presumed to associate his own unworthy efforts. Aware that this D r a m a has
been considered throughout Europe as one of the noble Poems of the present
day, the Manager has spared no effort to produce it in a Style equal to its original representation, and worthy of its merits. N o research has been omitted to
obtain the most authentic models for Dress and local Scenery ; those adopted
in P a r i s have been carefully followed, except where corrected by higher
authorities:; and neither cost nor labour have been wanting to offer this production to the British P u b l i c with every accessory circumstance of Splendor
that could contribute to its effect.

of T H E R M O PYLjB* has been most triumphant. Not only have the construction and diction been pronounced such as would do honor to any Stage, but
the Picturesque and Classical correctness of the Scenery, Costume, X Decorations, furnish the most lively delineation of the Manners, Religions Solemnities,
Martial Exercises, and Warlike Achieamtnts of those remote but celebrated Times of Antiquity, that had ever been attained in Scenic Representation ;
whilst the rivetting interest of the Story, dramatic force of the Situations, and powerful portraiture of Character, supported us they are by the admitted
excellence ofthe Acting, constitute such a tout ensemble of histrionic perfection that has sufficed to excite the most lively interest, rapturous applause, and
secured a decided popularity. Its announcement for Repetition being nightly hailed by enthusiastic Acclamations, it will be Repeated Every Evening
till further Notice.
•^'Notwithstanding the numerous Novelties that areprepared for Representation, the constant and anxious Enquiries for the entertaining and highly
popular Drama of VIDOCQ, the FKENCH T H I E F TAKER, render it imperative on the Manager to re-produce it tor the ensuing SixNights; after
which, that which has been universally considered the most interesting nnd amusing Piece of Auti-biography ever offered to the Public, must, in its dramatic
form, be positively withdrawn.

With however eager acttnoaity we may trace the History of Battles, Lost or Won, or follow the career of tlw Adventurer, from early obscurity through
the bright Path of Victory to the splendour of a Throne; the interest felt in his fate, will not terminate with his Exploits and his Triumphs, but will cling
with equal force to his reverses and his downfall; ft feeling approaching to sympathy will carry our enquiries to his moments of misfortune, and will, perhaps, survey with redoubled interest his last moments. It is not, perhaps, without a sigh of pity, we can behold him groan his last in a distant Clime, far
frora alt those whose uifectioniite endearments might disarm the King of Terrors of his Scorpion sting. In the above Drama every care has been taken to
i avoid all political allusions that could be offensive to national or individual feeling, and to present a picture of recent events at once interesting, affecting,
and impressive, and destitute of every tendency that could give birth to an objection.

Mr. DAVIIM3E respectfully announces to the Public, that he has Engaged the

And hftying, by these important Additions to his former very Efficient and Talented Company, succeeded in combining
n Body of Histrionic excellence seldom collected in one Theatre, and certainly never before united in an Establishment
referred to the Class of Minor Tbeatres, he feels himself imperatively called onto suspend the issue of A L L ORN>BBS
of gratuitous Admission, and ALL PAY GUUERS. With the view of preventing disappointment, and all appearance of
a Breach iftf Engagement W I t n " n v P * r t °f * n e Public, sjuch Pay Orders as are now in Circulation will be admitted
on Three ^evenings pf the Week, viz. THURSDAYS, FRIDAYS, and SATURDAYS, but on the Three First Evenings of
the Week there can be no Admission bat at the Established Prices; and, from the present date, no more Pay Orders
vill be issued. As the Entertainments which the Manager will now be enabled to oiler will be such as to compete with
Establishments pf the first Magnitude, he feels confident of the Public Patronage even iu a larger degiee than it is hw
pride already to acknowledge.

ttt-The Triumphant Success of the NKW COMIC BVKLBTT*, in Five Acli, culled, the J E W of CANADA, tonus an Epoch in Theatrical H u tory. It is long since a Comic Drama, in Five Aets, has been produced at any Theatre, which has had the good fortune to conciliate the public
approvtit; whilst it is scarcely in thepower of language to express the Rapturous and Universal Testimonials of Delight which have accompanied each
Representation of the above Piece. The literary merit of the production, powerfully supported and illustrated as it is, by the incomparable excellence of
lite Acting, not only excites throughout the Performance every expression of sympathy and gratification, but its announcement for Repetition is Nightly
hailed by deafening and continuous Tumults of Applause for some minutes duration; whilst the Public voice is echoed by the unanimous and unequivocal
panegyric of the whole of the Public Press. A continued succession of Novelty had been prepured for the appearance of the above eminent Performers
during their Engagement; bnt the very flattering reception of the above Comic Drama, and its increasing attraction, render it impossible for the Manager
to withdraw it; he has, however, added Tuto Entirely NEW PIECES

JOHN OVERY, the MISER
O F SOUTHWARK
T h i s D r a m a is founded on an old biographical fragment of John Ovary,
vho brfore there was any bridge Infill over tin- T h a m e s , rented a Ferry Boat,
which used to convey Passengers, fcc. from Southwark to the C i t y . Overy
was a Prodigy of peuuriousness; and by a j u s t visitation of providence, fell
a victim to his avarice, f"t it i* told of him in the fragment before alluded to,
" T h a t to save one day's expencea, first he counterfeited himself sick, and the
next day to die, and his body laid o u t , for no other purpose than to Htw one
days provisions, apprehending that whilst his body was above ground, his
servants would not b e so umiatural a* to take any intmnerof food till they had
MM him in the earth, purposing to recover next morning, after the charge was
•lived; a n d with this he acquainted his d a u g h t e r , wh«», against Iter own wilt,
consented to satisfy his h u m o u r . H e was then laid out for dead, and w r a p t
u p in a sheet (for he woald not be at the expeuce of a coffin) HI his cLmntber,
with one candle set b u r n i n g at his head and auotlter at his feet, which was the
i ustom of the time. H i s apprentices hearing of the go»d tidiugs, hop^ug In
he rid of this penurious servitude, ( M M to see the j o j f u l speetucle, and supposing him really d e a d , began to dance and skip about th>corpse. O n e run
int* the kitchen, and breaking open the c u p b o a r d , brought o u t the brown
loaf, another fetched o u t the e r a s * , a n d a third drew a rl»gou of beer and
began filling their empty bellies (being almost starved) and rejoicing umoug
themselves, thinking they were in expectation of future help and com tor I,
mid bring freed from the liard usiiuge they had endured. T h e old man laid
quaking all this while to see the waste, and thinking he would be undone he
, V.uUl endure it no longer, h u t stirring and struggling in his sheet tike u ghost,
und taking a candle in each hand, was going to rout them for their botdticsM,

FERRY.

when one of them, thinking it was the Devil in his likeness, in amazement
c a u g h t hold of the but-end of a broken oar, and at on« blow struck o u t his
brains. T h u s he, who only thought to counterfeit death, occasioned his own
death in earnest, and the law acquitted the fellow of the a c t , as he was the
prime occasion of hi" own death."
" T h e d a u g h t e r ' s lover hearing of the father's death, made all possible
haste to L o n d o n ; but. alas! with more haste than good speed, for riding fast,
his horse unfortunately threw him j u s t as he entered into L o u d o n , and broke
his neck. The**1 disasters on the daughter eoiuiug one upon another, and be*
ing troubled with a n u m b e r of new suitors, she resolved to retire into a cloister
of religious nuns, a n d determined tin;* whutsiwver her hither had left her b y
his death, she would dispose of us twur as she could to t h e honor of her
Creator, and the encouragement of his religious service, and caused, near t h e
place where her father lived, and she was born, the foundation of a famous
church to lie laid, which at her own charge was finished, a n d by her dedicated
hi tin- b|< N-ed Virgin Mnry, in memory of which pious a c t , and that her
name might live to alt posterity, the people added her name also to that given
by her and culled it St. Nary Overf, which title it in general beam to this
Such w the r u d e narrative of the fate of J o h n Overy. I t will be seen that
the biography, in its self, offers h u t few incidents to the D r a m a t i s t , who has
consequently resorted to invention for circumstances illustrative of unparalleled
avarice of the Miser, without, it is hoped, violating; probability, or (which
indeed is hardly possible,) overcharging the original picture of selfishness and
misery presented by the penurious hero of real life.

Sussex Coast, and will be found to abound in the deepest and most pathetic Interest It
will also afford an unprecedented opportunity for the display of Canine Sagacity, which,
whilst it is wholly subservient to the general Action of the Drama, must likewise
enhance the value of its impressive and striking details of Domestic Life.

MONDAY, JANUARY 31st, 1831, AND D U R I N G T H E W E E K ,
T h e Entertainments will commence with a Military Spectacle, embracing the main Incident* of the Life of Bonaparte, to b e Called,

BONAPARTE'S

{fi^To the History of a man who has played so important a part in the
grand Drama of human existence, as was sin>t;iiued by the Warrior abotc
named, a peculiar interest is attached ; the iuteiiMty *tf which H augmented
by the intimate relations which almost every event of Ins life had with our
own foreign and domestic policy. B u t , with however eager a degree i&f fiiru*»ity we may trace the history of battles lost or won, or follow the career of
the Adventurer from early obscurity t h r o n g , the bright path of Victory to
the splendour of a T h r o n e , and a degree Of |K»wer hcarcely ever equalled,—the
interest felt in his fate will not be terminated with his exploits ami his triumphs,

DESTINY!

b u t will cling with eijiml force to his reverses and his downfall; a feeling a p proaching to s\ mpathy will carry our enquires to his moments of misfortunes,
the scenes of his humiliation, and wilt perhnos survey with redoubled interest
his last moments. I t is not without a thrill of national exultation that We can
view the chosen Child of Victory vanquished by the valour of our C o u n t r y m e n ,
and uppruai h, as a Captive, those Shores winch he once vainly threatened t >
tread ah a conqueror ;—it is not, perhaps, without a >agli of pity, that we can
behold him groun his last in a distant clime, far from all those whose affec-f
tionate endearments might eft sarin the King of Terrors of his scorpion sting.

of an universal principle of animal creation.—The fondness of tt Parent for hi* offspring, the Tragedy of** Brutus" fat displayed how far

•

I P S ! M',": V e t e r a n & his P r o g e n y
• % In reproducing this Prama, as originally performed nt the Coburg, 4 Years sin.cp, Mr. D A V I D U E lias no wish to enter into competition with the Theatre Royal, that has just brought forward another Version of it, or institute invidious comparisons ; he simply wishes to.
thmr hqw very unjust and inconsistent that Theatre has been in its conduct to this Establishment. It is in the knowledge of the Puh(jp,
that legal proceedings have, more than once been carried into effect against him, lor Performing Dramas similar to those produced on, what
• !|Pt called, the Legitimate Boards; yet in the face of all this, the very Parties instituting those proceedings, apprppriate to themselves a subject,
(hat Four Years possesion have made peculiarly the property of this Theatre ; it would be thought, that what is justice in one case, stjquld
I 'so in the other, that a ctce versa right should he held by both parties ; but the indpfinite law on the subject, as now expounded, says no!
id that which is trespass when acted upon at the Coburg, is perfect equity at Drury Lane ! The Coburg Theatre hat long been remarkable
i< r its success, in first adapting from the French Stages the peculiar class of Dramas, that from time to time, make their appearance in Paris j
pot to particularize further, " T H E T H R E E G E N E R A T I O N S , " afterwards produced at Drury Lane Theatre, as " T H E H I D D E N T R E A S U R E , "
»d the present impressive Drama, " 102, o n THE V E T E R A N AND H I S P R O G E N Y , " now produced at the same Theatre, iiudpr the Title of
' T H E L E G I O N O F H O N O R , " will be sufficient evidence. Mr. Davidge does not mean to contest the right of any Theatre, adapting Pieces at
ifi pleasure, from the French, he merely contends, that if the Patent Theatres think proper, as tl|ey are now in the Weekly
h.tbit of doing, of borrowing the Pjeces pf the Minor Houses, and more especially those of the Coburg, they should not attempt to hinder him,
I" taking it] return from them, whenever temporary circumstances might render 6uch a proceeding necessary.

ART OF SELF-DEFENCE,

A REFORMER

In order to give light „.</ ,hade to the Evening. Amusement, will be added, nothing like a Piece, rfass-ingneither with Melodrama, Tragedy
Comedy, Opera, Burletta, Farce, Interlude, or Pantomime, but merely the effervescence of the Pericranium-a start—an idea-somelhing out of
nothing—no opposition at all events to SHAKESPEARE, Pooh! let the sublime dead rest in their grave.: the immortal Billy's Works would not
bring a/«rrf.n extra now-a-days: so the Pre mines put forth in Down-. Street I No, no, " Reform it altogether," something NEW must be the
Caper \ will then here it is my Masters, and altho' produced near PEKL-. Printing Office, N,«, C f . y e t it is „ sort of antidote to Uaitimat. Terrace,
a bit of gig—movement, on the /'are—but nevertheless nothing to stir Uf/the host of Dramatic Scribblers—Translator.—Adaptors-or Scissor, and
Paste Chaps I ••> Tu English, sirs, from top to toe." Most certainly, it contains nothing to alarm the onginality OIPLANCHK ; or, put the Grand
Mogul of Punsters, DICKY PEAKH on the/rer .'! neither is it intended to reduce that lively Master oflncident, BILLY MONCRIBFFE to a stand still
but on the contrary only to put him on the qui tire. Far, very far be it, from any thing like a wish to send JERROLD to the briny deep for fresh
supplies ! No " Perish the thought! ne'er be it said, that any false signal, have been thrown out in order to Hlrand, BALL, the Pilot who weathered
the storm! Not t^hiht^a«U^H/r«c«:k-boM
on the Theatrical Ocean without a rudder, i 8 nothing more nor less than the funny strolls and
adventure, of A SHOCKING B I D HAT !! Good Heavens! what next! don't be too fa.ltdiou,—recollect it is head-work, and connected with
the understanding and diffusion of know ledge-trie representation of a queer skimmer—a worn-out tile I—a spoonev topper-a wretched pimple-cover
—and the climax—a discarded CAS r o i l ! Hear it ye Edinburgh, Quarterly, and Blackwood', Mag,.\ listen to it also you Men of Taste, Style
and Elegance I Bear it likewise in mind, it Is a light article, affording relief to the awfully, cutting-np A T H E N K U M , the hood-winked l.tterary
Journal, and the whole race of Critics in general—an en-pa„ant affair altogether ! Then thus it is—" Call a Hose by any other name, and it will

W h a t si Shocking Bad H a t !

With New and Selected Music, Scenery, Dresses, Deeoratious &c. ke.
i8 Husic composed sad arranged by Mr. T. Hughes.—The Piece W rilteo expressly for this Thentre, by the Author of " REFORM, oft JoB» BeiL
TRIUMPHANT I " fee. fcc. (CC-

Much Curiosity having been excited, to know the Origin of the Very popular saying, " What a Shocking Bsd H«t!" now so general
HbBtit Town, ami several explanations having been given, some of which are not in the slightest degree correct; the Proprietor oi this 1 hestrt,
i ver anxious to meet the wishes <>! the Public, lias taken some pains to procure s Dramatic Signification of it, from the Pen of the Author
: " Reform," which he has great pleasure in pre* .ntiiig to the Visitors and Patrons of the C O B U R G ; assuring them, they will fins) it correct,
s J be trusts, satisfactory.
It hat been stated, that the expression hail its rise from n certain Parliamentary Agent, delivering to all Ihe Constituents of hi* Patron,
return from their purchased suffrages, a N u t H A T , each, which, however, wore so badly, and had in a short time, so very Borough-mooring an ap|>earance, HS to extort from every Spectator, the involuntary ejaculation, " What a Shocking Bad H a t ! " Others again assert, that
•' originated from the circumstance of the HATTER, of a certain Popular Character, sending him home a New Beaver, aad taking his VVifc
ij' 1 causing him to exclaim, whenever he surveyed the memento of his deprivation, which proved as frail as the Lady herself. " W h a t a
locking Bad H i t ?" the loss being fell in all w HVS. Neither of these however, nor any of the other Stories current on the subject, have their
^igin in fact: the real History of the Shocking Bad Hat, occurred in a Private Family not a Hundred Miles from the Neighbourhood of this
•eitre, which the Author of the Piece was in the habit of Visiting. The Enigma therefore, is now for the first time, unriddled; the Nattes
... the Parties, are for obvious reasons fictitious i but in other respects, all who wish to know the authentic Origin of the Exclamation, " What
Shacking Bad H a t ! " may now have their Curiosity* fully gratified.

This Drama will be found to display a powerful, yet correct picture of Humble Life, at once rejecting the speculative and ideal;

II this be true, the present effort will, it is hoped, be found particularly worthy the'attention of the Drama's Patrons, who will discover in
' ihe short and simple annals of the poor" Maid Servant, events, feelings and affections, of the highest importance, of the dearest and most

' litre will necessarily be a variety, but the good will oppose and shame the bad ; thusdisplayed, a Moral may be gained from the
-Healthy Burglar—the Hypocritical anil Sclfihh UtU er-thc Reckless Tyro in Crime-awl Confirmed and Wrinkled Vice.
Ml of whom are anatomized to warn and disgust, and not filscly arrayed to intoxicate and allure. In short the Drama will represent Chapters and events, to be found in every day life, in the English Metropolis; it is hoped, it will prove a copy, not a distortion of human
;ure; and, although it is not presumed to advance Martha n~H/is as a rival heroine to the crowned and regally invested creations of lofty
I agedy, and it is trusted, that her Story will not be declared deficient, either in dramatic or in moral interest. Humility of station it will
'. remembered, cannot lessen innate worth. The Poet has beautifully desciibed the Achillean Shield, but on the other hand, be it rememK red, a fine Piece of moral Philosophy, has been extracted from a Broom-stick.

If this be true, the present effort will, it is hoped, be found particularly worthy the attention of the Drama's Pations, who will discover in
" the short and simple annals of the poor" Maid Servant, events, feelings and affections, of the highest importance, of the dearest and most
absorbing interest. One of the characteristics of the spirit of the age, is the decline of that fastidiousness which was wont to vote all things
essentially vulgar in Society, that were necessarily humble. Happily we now recognize true dignity in human nature itself, and not in its »•tificial modifications, in its cumbrous and imposing trappings. The human heart has proved too much for the " Fashion-mongers," In th*
present Drama, personages will be introduced of a course and reckless nature, only in contrast to more delicate and amiable delineations.
There will necessarily be a variety, but the good will oppose and shame the bad ; thusdisplayed, a Moral may be gained from the
Stealthy Burglar—the Hypocritical and Selfish Uswer~the Reckless Tyro in Crime-anrl Copjirmed and Wrinkled Vice.
All of whom are anatomized to worn and disgust, and not falsely arrayed to intoxicate and allure. In short the Drama will represent Characters and events, to be found in every day life, in the English Metropolis; it is hoped, it will prove a copy, not a distortion of human
nature; and, although it is not presumed to advance Martha Willis as a rival heroine to the crowned and regally invested creations of lofty
Tragedy, and it is trusted, that her Story will not he declared deficient, either in dramatic or in moral interest. Humility of station it will
be remembered, cannot lessen innate worth. The Poet has beautifully described the Achillean Shield, but on the other hand, be it remembered, a fine Piece of moral Philosophy, has been extracted fr»m n Broom-stick.

NAPOLEON
Of Humble Life; or, G y p s e y J a c k .

The Scenery from the best Authorities that could be procured,—The Dresses from Rosemary Lane, some of them the Identical.
Ambition is confined to no class, it extends to every rank in Life, from high to low; it alike exerts its influence in the Hovel of the
Costermonger, and the Palace of the Emperor. The Proprietor of the Coburg Theatre, therefore, deems no apology necessary in the. present
universal '1 neatrical Phobia of Philo-Bonaparteism,for putting in his claim to Public notice as a 'minnow amongst the Tritons.' E<-erv incdent in the Life of the Great General himself, has been long since exhausted, in representation on his boards, though with rather a more proper regard to true British feeling, than has been manifested by some of his Contemporaries! With every admiration for the consummate genius
and expansive mind of the ambitious Corsican, the most inveterate, at the same time, that he was the most glorious of England's F.nemies, the
Proprietor could not bring himself seduously to keep out of sight, all those Heroic atchievements of his Co intrymen, which at the expense of
nearly Five Millions of Money, and a torrent of her bravest and best blood, effectually crush'd a despotisn, lhat if successful, would have
made Fngland a province of France, and every Englishman a Vassal at the lootstool of the Conquerer, the Crowning Triumph of Waterloo,
was not pass'd over in silence in deference to Gallic vanity; nor was the glories of Wellington (as a Soldier, the greatest of the ereat) unjustly withheld from British admiration, when dramatizing the Adventures of one, of whose destiny, he was the arbiter, and under whose
mastery, the Star of that destiny set for ever! neither was the F.xile awarded by the united voice of ravaged F.urope, held up to Britons, by
Briton i, as matter of reproach, and subject at once of censure and commiseration ; at the same time, in presenting the similar progress through
life, of an adventurer of a Humbler class, not the slightest disrespect is intended to the memory of the great Hero personally ; it is merely
sought to raise a harmless laugh at that accommodating deference, which can lend itself to truckle to the prejudices of others, at the expence
of its own self honor and gratification. Fas Haste ah doceri, it a desirable maxim enough, but it has its limits; we .nay profit from our rivals,
but we should not become their instruments.

Jack, born on "Black-heath in 1773, was brought up at Sydenham, which he left for the Fives Court, under Big
Ben, in 1787; shortly afterwards, he assisted in the demolition of the Norwood Stocks, and on the enclosure of t h .
Common, by the Overseers, was admitted one of the opposing gang ; at this period, the spectacle commences:

The Performances will Commence with (lath Time) M entirely Original DOMESTIC DRAMA, of powerful interest, (id Three AcW
^ ^ ^ ^ » which i» Nightly received with shouts of approval, written By the Author of Black Evtd Susan, Stc to he Called,

M a r t h a Willis
THE MAID SERrANT.

Thit Drama will be found to display a powerful, yet correct picture of Humble Life: at once rejecting the speculative and ideii
it will combine Character, and Scene, as they really exist in the world, casting a vivid and faithful reflection of the manners of that portion gj
society, which it is in the present attempt, intended peculiarly to illustrate. An enlighted Critic of the present day has said:
" The highest Public interest, is only made up at last, of what interests all privately,"
If this be true, the present effort will, it is hoped, be found particularly worthy the attention of the Drama's Patrons, who will discover in
«' the ihort and simple annals of the poor" Maid Servant, events, feelings and affections, of the highest importance, of the dearest and mo*
absorbing interest One of the characteristics of the spirit of the age, is the decline of that fastidiousness which was wont to vote all thmn
essentially vulgar in Society, 'that were necessarily humble. Happily we now recognize true dignity in human nature itself, and not in its i,
tificul modifications, in its cumbrous and imposing trappings. The human heart has proved too much for the " Fashion-mongers," In the
•reseat Drama, ^t«ona«a will be introduced of a course and reckless nature, only in contrast to more delicate and amiable delineation,
There will ne<esssrilj' be a variety, but the good will oppose and shame the bad; thusdisplayed, a Moral may be gained from the
Sttalthy 3urglar~the Hypocritical and Selfish Uswer-the Reckless Tyro in Crime-ami Confirmed and Wrinkled Vice,
All of whom are anatomized to warn and disgust, and not /alsely arrayedtointoxicate and allure. In short the Drama will represent CI*
rmrttrs and events, M'be found in every day ^fe, in the English Metropolis; it is hoped, it will prove . copy, not a distortion of hunm
nature; and, although ltia not presumed to advance Martha Willis as a rival heroine to the crowned and regally invested creations of loft;
Tragedy, and it is trusted, that her Story will not be declared deficient, either in dramatic or in moral interest Humility of station it will
be rememb-^.
cannot lessen innate worth. The Poet ha. beautifully described the Achillean Shield, but on the other hand, be it remembered, a * '* P l e c e •» moral Philosophy, has been extracted from a Broom-stick.

Programme, & order of the Scenery, displayed expressly for this Spectacle
Jack, born on Black-heath in 1773, was brought up a t Sydenham, which he left tor the Fives Court, under Big
Ben, in 1787; shortly afterwards, he assisted in the demolition of the Norwood Stocks, and on the enclosure . f tb« ,.
Common, by the Overseers, was admitted one of tbe opposing gang ; at this period, the spectacle commences:

O>f Humble Life; or, Gypsey Jack.

Tl i« Scenery from the best Authorities that could be procured.-The Dresses from Rosemary Lane, some of them the Identical.
A mbition is confined to no Class, it extends to every rank in Life, from hightolow; it alike exerts its influence in the Hovel of tin
Costermoii; ret, and tbe Palace of the Emperor. The Proprietor of the Cob urg Theatre, therefore, deems no apology necessary in the present
universal T beatrical Phobia of Philo-Bonaparteism, for putting in bis claim to Public notice as a 'minnow amongst the Tritons.' K'-ery incident in the Lite of the Great General himself, has been long since exhausted, in representation on bis boards, though with rather a more proper regard t.o true British feeling, than has been manifested by some of his Contemporaries! With every admiration for the consummate genius
and expansi ve mind of the ambitious Corsican, the most inveterate, at the same time, that he was the most glorious of England's Enemies, the
Proprietor c ould not bring himself seduously to keep out of sight, all those Heroic atcbievements of his Countrymen, which at the expense of
nearly Five Millions of Money,
rloney, and a torrent of her bravest and best blood, effectually crush'd a despotism, that if successful, would h»r»;
hman a Vassal at the lootstool of the Conquerer, the Crowning Triumph of Waterloo,
made' England a Province of France, and every Englishman
was not pa!
pasis'd over in silence in deferencetoGallic vanity; nor was the glories of Wellington (as a Soldier, the greatest of the great) nojustly withheld from British admiration, when dramatising
ising the Adventures of one, of whose destiny, he was the arbiter,
arbiter. and tmder wlioe
mastery, the Star of that destiny set for ever! neither was the Exile awarded by tbe united voice of ravaired Europe, held up to Britons,by
Britons, as matter of reproach, and subject at once of censure and commiseration; at the same time, in presenting the similar progress through
life, of an adventurer of a Humbler class, not the slightest disrespect is intended to the memory of the great Hero personally ; it is inertly
sought-to raise a harmless laugh at that accommodating deference, whichranlend itself to truckle to the prejudices of others, at the expence
of its own self honor a«d gratification. Fas Haste s i doceri, is a desirable maxim enough, hut it has its limits; wc may profit from our rivals,
out we should not become their instruments.

In announcing the continued Representations by Mr. KEAJ¥\ at the
JOBURG THEATRE, or a Series of his most popular Characters^ the
)rietor begs to remark that those of the Theatrical Public who have
llto only witnessed the efforts of this great Tragedian in the vast
•s of the Patent Theatre*, will find their Admiration and Delight at
•plendid Powers tenfold increased by embracing the present Oppory of seeing them exerted in a Theatre of moderate Dimensions*
duff every Master look and fine Tone of the Artist, to be distinctly
ana heard. These advantages have fully proved, that at no period
Career, were the fine Talents of this inimitable Actor, displayed in
Perfection as they have been during his present Engagement.
le Proprietor of the COBURG, feels a proud Satisfaction in reflecting
that the Preference for the first Appearance of Mr. KE AN on this Side the
Water,(" the Side on which the oJdcn Theatres once stood," -A hereShaksre, Massiuger, and Ben Jonson wrote and acted,) has been given to
llieatre, and he trusts, that the style in which the different Dramas
Mr. KEAN's Performances have been produced, have not disgraced
the Distinction thus flatteringly bestowed on him.

en with an eye of desire by Sir Roderick Arnndel, an English Knight, high
in the favor of King Henry IV. and who possessed the Caatle of Cerrig
Canaan, near Cardigan ; presuming on hi. court favor, he ventured to attack the Castle of Twm John Catty [the familiar abbreviation of hi. name]),
burned it to the ground, and carried off the Lady Elinor; Twm John Catty
in the heat of hi. vengeance for thi. outrage, turned hi. arm. again.t the
Castle of Cerrig Cennan, which be likewise reduced to ashes, but failed in
regaining po.sea.ion of hi. beloved Elinor, The influence of Arundel proeared, for tbi. act of retaliation, Twm John Catty to be proclaimed an
Outlaw, hi. Father and Mother were seized aa hostage, for hi. behaviour,
and perished of grief and hardship in confinement ; thus .nine; to madness,

to visit hi. wrong, on mankind at large in the character of e Bandit Chief-

tain, hi. career aa which was characterised no leas by his bold daring, than
hi. magnanimity and generosity to all those whose weakness or misfortunes had a claim on bis forbearance. In the famous rebellion of Mortimer
and the Percys, when the insurgent army retreated into Wales.Twnt John
Catty was easily persuaded by hia count ry man Glendower, to join himself
to the ranks opposed to the English king. After the death of Hotspur,
and total defeat of the rebel army, Twm John Catty retreated to h i . native
mountains, and wa. there left to bear alone the whole force of royal vengeance. He held out most valiantly to the last, anil having secreted hi.
beloved Elinor in a remote mountain cavern, determined to defend himself
to the latest breath, and in the hut attack which was made on him, after a
desperate conflict, he feil headlong from tho summit or hi. cavern to the

H E R E AS, upon information duly given to us by Anthony Fitcnaih,
W
No. 8,(154,327, of our Metropolitan Police, that Dmidgr, or the Royaf
C»bur$ Theatre, in our Parish of M*ambeth, had prepared a Representation of
our Imperial Amusements, in a Drama called DOMINIQUE THE RESOMATTE-, And whereas, upon such information w e were induced to
transport ourself to the said Theatre, and to remain seated (for sufficient
and accustomed warmth) across the Gas Chandelier, during the Performance of the said Drama called Dominique. And whereas w e found myself
there represented in our true colours, ma most amiable and amusing personage,
as we hate food cause to know we are, and were altogether muck delighted and
edified by our own portrait. And whereas we hear that other Theatres are
preparingto follow the excellent example of the Ritual Coburg, and to play the
0evU to the great satisfaction of out numerous friends the play-goers oftandm %
And whereas, in the opinion of all charitable and truly well-disposed
persons, all Actors have, from time immemorial, been our own peculiar
property, THESE ARE TO tf'IhhjiJVlP
COMMA SD YOV to prepare
fit and proper lodgings for all who have enacted, or shall enact the POSSESSED.,
taking care that they have special warm berths, and moreover that you should came
to be erected a spacious Theatre, of red-hot brum, fit to reflect alt their gittrine
countenances, and prepare all fit and suitable Scenes, DresseSf and Decorations
forthe production of this ourfavorite Drama. And forasmuch as we have gained
the first impression of this inimitable entertainment from the performance
afthe aforesaid Datidge, it is our will and pleasure that he shall be the first
to represent the Character <of Dominique in our Imperial'Theatre, wishing, of
our benevolence that all our subjects below should enjoy the pleasure of
which we have partaken when seated on the Chandelier of the
ROYAL
COMURG THEA&RE
aforesaid : And we assign the said i>amdge
for his diet, 4 quart* of brimstone soup, and 2 pecks of red hot coats
daily, as a mark of our regard.
By his Imperial Majesty,

THEATRE.

UNDER THE SOLE MANAGEMENT OF MR. DAViDGE.
ThePKOFRl BTOR M l it to be his duty to announce ta Uie Puhlio, the continued and unrivalled attracting of tie SEK1ES of DRAM AS, which
he has succeeded in procuring from the PRINCIPAL FRENCH THEATRES, Mid which have been produced at this Establishment, with a
celerity and effect which has precluded all competition. The enthu iastic approbation and applause nightly bestowed upon " The VICTIM of ST.
'tlKGtm," " riOTORINK,'- and the more recent performance of " DOMINIQUE THE RESOLUTE," fully authorise his thus noticing the success of the
efihrts already mane, and induce him to assure the Public, that one of the principal features of his Management will henceforth be—the Production of all
FRENCH PIECES Ol' MERIT; nearly at the same time with their Representation on the Stages of PARIS.

On, THE
ft^Ss-^TAi'j
Drama will be found to comprise a Plot and Incidents far more Original than any which hate for a long Time claimed the Attention
*li<!lsS °f ! ' l c P"hl'c.
The Story is so contrived, as, plausibly, to account for the Belief of the Hero of the Piece, that he has absolutely ' made
% Compact, with the King of Fiends.' The Events, of a mixed Nature, both Tragic and Comic, which principally arise out of tins Conviction, are
ijual/y unusual in Conception, and happy in their Adjustment.
So much may at least be said, as it is but a just and genuincTribule to the brilliant
Abilities of the French Dramatists, MM. D ' E P A G N Y and D U P I M . The Fashion ofit» English Dress can be sanctioned only by Public Approval.
This short Notice is placed in the Bill by Way of Prologue, as it is not customary to deliver such Addresses on the Stage of this Theatre.

PUBLIC

T H E Changes in the Situations, Sentiments, and Prospects of Society effected in the last few Years,-~tbe

and by Reducing the Prices of Admission to the Royal Coburg Theatre, to suit the means of the real
Lovers and Supporters of the Drama, advance the permanent Interests of the Stage, at the same time that
he meets the wishes, and conduces to the Gratification of the Public.
In taking this step, Mr. DA V I D G E feels it necessary to make a few R e m a r k s in its Vindication and Explanation : The Practice of issuing Free Orders to fill a House to an exclusive number of Persons has,
for a long time, existed in almost every Theatre ; a Practice that, while it has not been of the slightest Benefit
to the Public, has been * most serines Injury to the Manager! h i s an undisputed Fact, that, at the Patent
Houses, as the Free and Privilege Litis are now conmttuted, upwards of 800 Persons are entitled to
obtain Admission gratis, before the Proprietors can touch one single Shilling: they are therefore obliged
to exact a high Price of Admission from those who do pay, to remunerate them for providing an Entertainment for those who do not. This acts injuriously in a double Sense : the major Portion of the Public,
noi beino- able to pay the high Prices at present charged for Admisssion to the respectable Part of the different
theatres', which to those who have a Family, really becomes a serious Expence, and yet, perhaps, anxious
m pntpriain that Family, while they would willingly pay a moderate Sum for that Gratification, are obliged to

i'»rovem7nt,"have long since been impressed with the Policy of adapting the Means to the Desire; and it is
nigh time (he Slagc should be equally provident.
To meet the growing March of Improvement, and the Desire for Recreation and Instruction, now so
prevalent tn ail Clauses, Publishers havefound it prudent to reduce the Price of the different Works of
FiotionofSir
Walter Scott, and other eminent Writers,fram
One Guinea and Half to 5s.; and to produce them even in a superior Stifle to any Editions they before issued to the World It is the same with
Periodical Works : Papers, that were formerly published at Id. and 8d. are now reduced to Id. and 2d.
The encreased number of Readers this Reduction has created, has amply remunerated the
Speculators,
and both the Public and 1 he Publishers have been Gainers to a great
Extent.

t h e a t r e s are not those lliev used to be—the late Hours introduced into Fashionable Life prevent the Aristocracy being the Patrons of the Drama; that Honor has merged into the more iutelligent though perhaps less
affluent Class, England's staple Children, wrongly termed the " M I D D L E C L A S S . "
Mr. D A V I D G E refers back t<r past Experience to prove, that no Change in the Price of Admission will
nduce any Chancre for the Worse in the Excellence of the Enterlainmemt of the R O T A L COBURG T H E A T R E .
Vhe Kng-geraefttof such Artists as KUAN, D O W T O N , &c. mustspeak Volumes. In fact, the Increased
R E C E I P T S ' consequent on the Pit and Boxes being filled by a bona-fide Audience, though at a reduced
Admission, to their being filled by an Audience only calculated to keep the Money out of the House, will
•nable him to supply even a superior Entertainment to any he has yet brought forward, fie therefore begs
•o announce to the Public, and the Friends of the Establishment in general, that, in future,

BOX ORDERS, which may be obtained at the Places enumerated at
the Foot of this Bill, will be admitted at the Boors, on the Payment of
ONE SHILLING and SIXPENCE each Person j and ORDERS for the
PIT on the Payment of ONE SHILLING each Person.

•he Love of Dramatic Entertainments has of late Years declined,~Sach is not the case ; the Lovers and Upholders of
I Theatric Arc are more numerous than ever, but the Declension from War to Peace Rest-wees, has precluded them from
in" that Patronage which their Inclinations no less than their Interests suggested. It is, however, confidently
.ll,*A tint the Redaction now announced in ihe Prices of Admission to the Coburg Theaire, will enable them to afford
hemsel'ves a cheap, rational, amMelightful Relaxation; at the s a w Time, it will give to the Proprietor the pleasing
P.werofredoubling all his Efforts for their Amusement, and still further proving his Gratiitude for that invariable
Patronage that has ever attended his Efforts.

lflth, I7th, and 18th Sights, takes Occasion to Notice, toatitwasn ot only first produced atthis Theatre, bat, i t the same Time, ventures to
Jtilj-*' offer the Coburg Version of this popular French Drama, and the Effect with which it is perforated, in fair and honorable Competition with the
numerous Pieces on the Subject, which are now being brought forward in almost all the Theatres in London. He is willing to place thif at a Test of tilt
((•sources of his Establishment, and of the Success with which they are employed, and trusts inat an uninterrrupted Contiauancecf such Efforts will ensure,
as he feels conscious it must, iu soma measure desierve, atleast, a Share of Public Patronage,—Mr DAVIDGE has irreat Pleasurein /maouncinifr that he hat

DOMINIQI E t h e R ESOLUTE
OR, THE

POSSESSED.

^This Drama will be found tocomprhe a Plotand Incidents far more Original than any which hate for along Time claimed the Attention
of the Public. The Story is so contrived, as, plausibly, toactount for the Belief ofthe Hero ofthePiece, that he lias absolutely 'made
a,l.'ompact with the King of Fiends.' The Evend, of a mixed Nature, both Tragic and Comic, which principally arise out of this Conviction, art
equally unusual in Conception, and happy in their Adjustment
So much may at least be said, at it is but a just and genuine! ribute to the brilliant
Abilities of the French Dramatists, MM. D'EeACNVnml D U P I K . The Fashion of it* English Dress can be sanctioned only by Public Approval.
This short Notice is placed in (lie Bill by Way of Prologue, as it is not customary to deliver such Addresses on the Stage of this Theatre.

lenentl Con-ictbo that exists of the Necen.it- of Metrenchment and Economy in all Branch/m, renderirt|ft imperative that a aimiUr feeling should be enlertained by ever-one seeking; the approbation of the Public,
HMlependatidy of other circumsUoces, has determined Mr. O A V l D G E to yield to the Current of Opinion,
and by Reducing the PHcet of Admission to the Royal Coburg Theatre, to suit the means of the real
tot-ers and Supporters of the Drama, advance the permanent Interests of the Stage, at the same time that
he meets the wishes, and conduces to the Gratification of the Public.
In taking this step, Mr. DA VRDGE feels it necessary to make a few Remarks rn its Vindication and Explanation.: T h e Practice of issuing Free Orders to fill a Haute to an exclusive number of Persons has,
for a loug time, existed in almost every T h e a t r e ; a Practice that, while it baa not been of the slightest Benefit
lo the Public, has been a most serious Injury to the Manager! It is an undisputed Fact, that, at the Patent
Houses, as the Free and Privilege Litts are now constituted, upwards of 800 Persons art entitled to
obtain Admission gratis, before the Proprietors eon touch one tingle Shilling: they are therefore obliged
to exact • aW|-A Prtce ef Admission from those who do pay, to remunerate them for providing an Entertainment for them mho do not. This acta injuriously ia a double S e n s e : the major Portion of the Public,
not behtg &We to pay U» high Prices at present charged for Admisssion to the respectable p a r t o f ^ different
Theatres, which to those who have a Family, really becomes a aeriotta Expence, and yet, perhaps, anxfoaa
jo entertain that Family, wMJe they would willingly pay a moderate Sum for that Gratification, are obliged to
wait till, by the Force of Interest, they can procure G R A T I S Admissions, or abstain from a favourite Amuse,
ment altogether. This Defection obliges the Manager either to play to empty Benches, or Mil hit Bonte
mih Orders, dittributed
only to certain Persons,
Thus both the Proprietor and the Pubfic s a f e r ; and
only thmu are the Gainert, who have m Claim to he to Other Caterers to Public Amusement ami Improvement, have long since been impressed with the Policy of adapting the Means to the Desire -.and it is

IN ANNOUNCING T H E PRODUCTION O f T H I S TRAGEDY,
Mr. DA VI D O E has the honor to solicit t h ; attention of the Public to the peculiar entertainment which is now, almost for the firm t'me
offered to them at a Minor I'hettre. It is fuuniled on one of the most popular traditions of Iriih history, and the authenticity of the la e is
proved by various yet eCisting records and monuments in the town in which the scene is laid. When a subject so dramatic as that quoted
liv Prince Puckler Muskau, is introduced to th« Stage, the .relation of itself should not at oil events be depreciated by the method of its
treatment The popularity which this play has already acquired in Dublin, where the national expects ion must be most highly raised and
the picture convqneiitly most difficult to icalize, has alleadv proved that the execution is equal to the theme.
Tins Drama has been III M O J T K D UY I'HK I VVl) MAJOR. T H E A I R K S , and it is fortunate that the Author possesses bv the means
of a minor one, nti opportunity of appealing from their decision to that of the Publico!' the Metropolis of ike United Empire, tin the j u s tice anil consideration of the Patrons of the Coburg a full reliance is placed, that this attempt to aid in the raising of thj modern legitimate
Drama to a fair rivaliy with that of past ages will he met in a spirit of encouragement and kindness, and that s Tragedy in Five Acts may r e .
eccivc as flatterinaa meed of applause in the County of Surrey, as in the City of Westminster.

The house of Walter Lynch is still remaining inGalway.a proof of its extent and of the past prosperity of the town may be found in the
fact that it is inhabited by upwards of thirty families.

The massacre which took place nt ih • Prison de V Abbaye-de-Sainte-Germain, on the 2d of September, 1792 and following Days, *as one of the mostTorrioW
scenes of the French Revolution. Dant"», then minister of jusiice, declared that Paris must furnish sixty thousand men il three days. The emissaries of the
Golmnuna of Paris harangued the populace, stating that the wives and children of the patriots must not be left exposed to Ilia fury elf the conspirators, who filled
the prisons, that these conspirators were armed, and that they were to efT. ct their escape on ihe followins uight, in order to deliver ihe king and his Cithily. F r o *
that morning tin gates of the capital were shut, hy order of the Commune. Several carriages, which were leaving the city, were stopped, and fifteen persora mas .
sacred without examination. Among them were several priests. At length (he alarm gun was find, the tocsin sounded, and the generate was beat: at this signal
the assassins hastened to the pi isons. In the monastery were the priests who refused to make oalh to the civil constitutions of the clergy, all i f whom were Blur*
tiered except two, one of those who escaped was the abbe Sicard, lata snperiolcudant of the deaf and dnnib asylum. At thi abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prr«,
they added the parade of a mock tribunal to the horrors of massacre. Twelve persons laken ftom the mob, were placed between the wickets of the ffison la take:
the'names from tho gaoler's bo k. The prisoners were interrogated separately ; those confined fortlebt were released, but whoever belonged to the court, or wa*
coufi.iod for his opinio is or wliosr name was illustrious, w is dismissed instantly from (lie tribunal into the bond* of a bijod-lhirsty mob, who were wailing at tlis
doors to massacre the unhappy victims as they came out, amidst shouts of " Vive la Nation I"

UNDER TUB >Q! i; IVfi-NAfiF.MFNT OF MR. IM\'1>».E.

Bil-IPPEIRA1 € E of Mi-. iOKIIill.

The attraction of the New Grand Historic<1 I'cr i ific Drama of the I OWER of NliSLE Nightly increases--it is uii.iniuin sly pronounced idle or the most
powerful, interesting, and impressive Dramaserer prodaced at a Minor Theatre; and the Manager hat abundant rause to coit.'i-atulate both himself and
the Public, on hia having been the first to introduce to their notice this most striking aid heart thrilling effort of the Modern French Drama.

PUBLIC NOTICE.
IT it not the business of the Proprietor of this establishment to notice the announcements ot those who compete with him, however absurd, unless such
announcements relate directly to himself. The Proprietor of the Surrey Theatre having distinctly mentioned the Cobuig Theatre, by name in lint Bills,aa
having by the conductof its in ina.tre.ment tended to depreciate the Dramatic Art, Mr. D.ividge feels it necessary to ask, Whether, Instead of Piiy Orders*
the Boxes o( the Surrey Theatre have not lately been filled with Orders, the Possessor of which paid NOTHING AT ALL : and, whether, evi ti in its
much higher condition, under the late Mr. Eiliston, those BOJC<S were not, by a processs of hocus-pocus, filled, as far as they were filLd, at KlVE t'KvCti
per head? It isa notorious fact that Admissions for Six Persons are, and for a long time have been, constantly issued from ili<- Surrey I heat re at the Price of
•Js.6d. under the pretext of payingforthe Bills, a thing unheard of in the annals of Minor Theatrics. If this be true, and that the Managers nf the Surrey
are the real depredators of the price of Dramatic Amusement, it amounts to little less "ban dishonesty, as it is mostalj ct hypocrisy, uudoi such a pretence
to use the resources and labour of other Minor Theatres for the benefit of that establishment. This is not, however, the only rnstaMe of such turpitude—
The Proprietor of the Surrey has certainly of late produced two pieces of our first living Dramatists! but has he not doue so without ottering the s lightrst
remuneration to the Authors of these Plays ?
As to the rest of his (the Surrey Proprietor's) boast, Mr. P.leaves it to that Pnblic's consideration, which has already received it with " iniirh luunhter."'
if not with "distinguished applause," and, uuable us he is to criticise fustian which is not English, he ventures to sum up its merits in the nords of the
Poet;
" Hey diddle diddle,
<• A little dog lauxh'd,
A cat and a
fiddle,
T o see such c aft,
A cow jump'd aver the moon ;
And thedish ran away with the spoon."
In con lusion, he will observe that the *' March of Intellect" having done
much for the Surrey Theatr e, might have gone a little farther, and taught
the Manuger, or his Secretary, as much of the English grammar as is necessary for the rreper concoction o f a phiy-biil. Mr D. V . Out ahiision would not
then have coufnunded himself with the Public in his last paragraph, in addition to rendering almost every other a ttatua of tinreidable nonsense. The Proprietor 'theCoburg acknowledges, however, with the greatest admi ration, the l.ovelty and splendour of the simile ol tin Upas Tree, which he veutures t»
translate it *he su»" * language as the other part of the Suney Bill, "them FISON Orders."
Trusting that ttc ability which has made so extraordinary a display fn the Surrey announcement will not quite aimihil ate'Tim v\hen exerltdiu the internal
mimngemeni of mat house, Mr. Davidge ventures to entertain some slender hope that a few of the Pay Orders, issued fr om^tln Coburg, will find their way
to its door, and thus escape the pilfering clutch nf his lival.

If further confirmation were needed of the dative conduct or thetwo managements, the instance of the production of ihe TOWER. OF NBSLE at each
House would be amply sufficient. At the t'obnrg, announced without puff, or any attempt at exciting a false popularity, it has lieen completely successful
Three weeks after its announcement here, the Manager of the Surrey boasts of his private understanding with the Proprielor of Ihe Porte St. Martin in
Paris, as affording him » copy of a Piece actually PRINTED IN MAY ; and uot content with this palpable abandonment of truth he sends a hired Author

Coburg Theatre,

Sept. 20,1832.

I T will take litt !<• tmultlft to show that the drninls oi the Proprietor of the Surrey Theatre are about as trustworthy as his assertion*.
HemtystiiatOr.L-rsfor Atlnimimi to that Theatre, have been " N l ' l T H K a U I R K C T L V N t ) R I N D I R E C T L Y S O L D , " and he defie,
" A 'i'HOlT^AND Ml*. DA VI DOES," (an elegant Specimen of the fis;ure of amplification), to prove that they have been. This, O N E
Mr. Ttavidse is nmmdnutly competent to ilo, and can be supported by a ' T H O U S A N D W I T N E S S E S if necessary. On the delivery of the
Surrey Play Bills to the Miopkeepers who expose them, a Demand is made of '1*. (id. per Quarter; a demand unheard of in the history of
diamatie affairs ; as it is u«iuil for all Minor Theatres to present an occasional Free Order to such shopkeepers, to induce them to incur the
trouble of taking in and exhibiting the Bills. And how is this demand rendered palatable? Why^a> before observed, by the presentation
of Three Orders for T w o Persons each, Quarterly, being for the Admission of each Person, 3d. flow let any one who knows what buying
and selliu" is, determine whether or not this is selling the Orders.
This Gentleman states, that " no Man breathing M O R E T H A N himself," (Mr. David.?e) " has done A T V T H E SO M U C H
injury, or so debased and degraded T H E C A U S E O F the Drama." T h e explicit and elegant Phraseology of this need scurcely be
remarked, as the Author h is renounced all pretmsions to a knowledge of the English tongue. But, to the fact.; it is notorious that no man
has more strenuously struggled to maintain and elevate the Drama (not t h e " C A U S E of it) at Minor Theatres than the Proprietor of the
t'ohurg '.witness the Penalties he has incurred at the suit of the Patent Theai.es; witness the names of the following Performer* who have

After which it may perhaps be permitted to enquire, what are the pretensions, on this score, of tbe Proprietor of the Surrey, which
entitle him to denounce the eftbrts of others. He engages a Company for the Summer Season, of course on the-understanding that t h e '
Summer Season is to extend to its usual duration; he closes the Theatre in the very middle of this Season, and leaves his company, in violation alike of good faith and good feeling, to a legal Remedy, from which the apprehension of being rejected in future must deter them
Why does this gentleman undertake the defence of Mr. Ellistonat the same time with his own? Doe, he think the memory of the former
honored by the association ? What have they in common ? T o be sure both have been Lessees of the Surrey Theatre, but the one maintained'as a Manager, an Actor, a Scholar, and a Gentleman—an eminence to which it is not permitted to every one to aspire. I t is unpleasant
to the Proprietor of the Coburg to intrude such matters on the attention of the Public ; he is little inclined to court such an altercation, but
«s little is he disposed to pass over in silence, of'md if puled," the vulgar and illiterate attacks of a rivalry which he think* might be conducted
a a manner more creditable to tin Parties.

rf-'jSS^-N
RE-OPENING this Establishment, after a Period of nearly three months, Mr. DAVIOGE be$-s leave to call the attention of the Public
K ^ e & i j , 0 s e v e r a l points, to which his own has been directed during th<^ Recess. Fully assured that the best method of ensuring ultimate successful
^^•H*
the strenuous effort to deserve it, he has carefully c onsidered the various essentials of rational Dramatic entertainment, aid ventures to place
before his Friends, and the Patrons of the Sta»e in general, such pretensions, as are warranted by the past, and such Arrangements as. he trusts, will be
onsidered improvements for the future. He first ventures to advert to

THE THEATRE ITSELF!
Which, by the almost unanimous testimony of witnesses before the Dramatis- Committee, and Hie admissions of nearly every one cup.ihlV of furmin* a
judgment, from architectural or histrionic experience, is allowed to be, for the Purpose* of SEEING and HEAKIiNG one of

THE VERY FIRST IN EUROPE!
While the Size is amply sufficient for all the effects oi Scenic d splay- Within its Walls, he tru-us, will be louod on the commencing- the ensuin*

Season

ASFIItANS,

Of deserved Populirity in the various Establishments from which they are selected.—To meet the just claims of i he Public in another moat needful particular

Several NOVELTIES, of peculiar and original Interest,
Have been procured from AUTHORS

of the highest CELEBRITY,
and will be produced in rapid Succession, with an unsparing Liber alitu, in
SCENERY,
DRESSES, and
DECORATIONS.
These requisites being thus placed b.fore the Lovers of the Drama, M:, DAVIDCiE is convinced that they need only be afforded at such a price as the
present depressed state of the times will render prudent on the one hand, and sufficient on the other to make his Theatre a place of har.iiual tesor I to all
within the vicinity, who desire such a relaxation from the fatigues and cares of the day, as may consist with a thinking Public. The 0»d rustoin of Flee
Orders, unjust in its principle, as rsndering the Manager's nearest friends his worst customers, and destructive of the receipts by which ouly a Theatre
can be honourably supported, will be entirely abolished ; nor will the mystification of Pay Orders, to be used at a lower price then that specified in trie
BUIs.be resorted to—The PRICES will themselves be REDUCED to

BOXES, Us. PIT, Is.

GAL. Off.

An arrangement to which the Proprietor pledges himself undevialingly to adhere—The Custom also of HALF PRICE, which has long been ennaidered
by Foreigners the stigma of the British Stage, convirting the Theatres in'.o mere lounges instead of places for the exhibitions of a high species of Art, will
thus be greatly curtailed, by being limited to tne BOXES ONLY, where ONE SHU LINO will be the Admission for the SECOND ACCOUNT.
By such a system it may be confidently asserted, that no Party of Individuals, according to their respective grade of society, will be enabled to pass an
Evening of amusement, either at home or elsewhere, at a cheaper rate, while the mixture of utility and pleasure offered by this particular speens o
Entertainment.»»ay fairly defy all competition with those who wish that the " Evening's pleasure may bear th morning's reflection "

The Proprietor, in submitting this interesting Piece to the notice of the Public, Mures then that for originality of design, pun y ••(siyle, and eflect of
situation, it deserve* • place among »«r fir-t minor If not major product wis. Tito dreadful enormities that the Hundreil-h aded Monster,ftAM'-LING,
drives the unwary to, are faithfully exfswd and poartrayed. i h e fallacy of hope is proved; and yet while i» inculcates a sfrand moral lesson, its lighter
parts are well calculated to char the eioad from the brow—the pansj from the heart —and five the generous soul vent in cheerful hearty laughter.

TEST OF SUCCESS I—Eonrth Week of THE WHISTLER.
The Proprietor frets il neediest (o announce to the Public hit motive lor root uuing the above n..med Piece, since from the East tu the West of Lioooo,
it is the prevalent topic of Theatrical Conversation—and, judging ft urn its attraction now, he has reason to <.it pose, that the general question of" Have
you seen the Whistler?" wi I, after u short time, he answered by •• Who has n o t seen the Whistler >" 'I he vcrydeftded bit which Una Piece has made
I* » compliment of the Public Taste. a>i i shows h>iw dear to the British heart is every reminiscence of the Great Bard, whose truly poetic spirit is
" Bed to the La nd of the Leal." It is al*o a g-atifying reflection to the Proprietor, that this singular and clever production, was offered to every Theatre
in London, and refused. from the eery reason ihat has contributed to its sttcoss, it being a Sequel to the Heart of Mid Lothian, and will prove to the Public
thai talented Production*—tin tenure from, whose pen - will always meet with notice and due reward at the Royal Coburg Theatre.

It needs not to advert to the peculiar circumstances of honourable self-denial, under which
Ma. SHI-KID AN KNOWLKH has thus resolved to bind up his fortunes with theirs, or to the encouragement they might dare to claim, relying upon these alone. They prefer to occupy higher and more
independent ground.
It wa, near thj» spot that SHAKSPEARR wrote, and SHAKSPKARB acted , and has left for us
the ririfying sense of his immortal and unapproachable glory. Here, too, the potent Author and
Actor, HKN JONSHN, triumphed, and here was witnessed flat the friendly and everlasting union
of It K'AUMONT and F I R T C H E R . They restore to it now an Author-Actor, whose humbler name yet
" offers no violence to things so majestical;" whose genius is admitted to belong to the order of the
same great family, in whose world he has lived, whose convictions he has undergone. They feel
something like the assurance that, in his new position, M R . K N O W L E S may be stimulated to the
highest efforts of his pen; for there he has around him the seme, as it were, of the personal presence,
and like employment, of the illustrious dead, to assure him—for its best exercise—of a fame only
inferior to theirs, and to render the idea of it beautiful as well as sure.

Doctor O'Toole, Mr. T. I.KE, In which * luiracter Im will introduce th« Comic Song of

And they are proud to say that his pen is not at present idle. It is employing its best and
busiest exertions for the Royal Victoria Theatre, where they dare to promise a New Play, worthy
of the reputation of the Author of " Virginius," " The Hunchback," and " The Wife."
