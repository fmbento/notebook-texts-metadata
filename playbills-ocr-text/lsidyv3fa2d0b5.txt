deeming the present a bad time for a political investment, thei there would be a good chance of Whig gain in England. But a present there is no appearance of a design on the part of th( Tories to decline the contest; and the probability that a seat now gained will be held for five or six years, may tempt many Torj gentlemen of property to incur a much greater outlay than wa: prudent at any election during the last two reigns.
Again, on the supposition that the Ministerial majority is only 46 or thereabouts, it is manifest that the Radicals would still hav< the power of keeping Lord Melbourne in or turning him out o office. Put opponents in the places of Radicals sure of theii election, and there is an end of the Whig song of triumph.
VALUE OF AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY: THE HANGMAN AND THE HEADSMAN.
We have been favoured with a copy of a petition presented to th Peers on Monday by the Duke of Richmond, on the subject c “the disgusting conduct” of the Gloucester hangman. It will b recollected, that an inquiry instituted by order of Government re suited in the acquittal of the man, and a virtual imputation c falsehood on the parties who accused him. As an “ officie person,” efforts were used to screen the hangman : it was evidentl considered a point of honour by Lord Duncannon to place tb character of Ketch in a fair light before the world. Unluckily however, the accusing parties were respectable men, and by n means willing to submit to the charge of having given false ev, dence in the case. They accordingly sent the following petition t the Duke of Richmond, with the names of witnesses and othe documents, to establish the truth of their statements.
“ We, the undersigned inhabitants of the city of Gloucester, having seen tha a paragraph which appeared in the papers some time since, respecting the dis gusting conduct of the hangman at the late execution in this city, has bee contradicted by authority ; and being prepared to prove by an ample number t competent witnesses, that the said executioner did on that occasion display most disgusting levity of conduct; that he did stiike the dead body with sue violence a, -o cause it to turn round, saying 1 Old chap, you are dead enough or some such words; and that he did address the crowd in a most unbecomin manner ;
“ We most respectfully request that your Lordships will he pleased to diret such further inquiiy into the facts of the case as may, in your wisdom, seei best calculated to arrive at the truth, and prevent the recurrence of such revolt ing scenes.	“ And your petitioners,” &c. &c.
We have no doubt that the petitioners state the truth. Th inquiry directed by Government was committed to the very partie most interested in screening the delinquents—Sheriff and Unde Sheriff; who, of course, would have been liable to reproof for em ploying such a fellow even in the capacity of hangman, and th' Linder Sheriff especially for allowing such revolting behaviour ii his presence,—for as it was his duty to be present, we take it fo granted that he was there.
But this, in a small way, is illustrative of the manner in whicl a Government generally examines into charges preferred agains its own officers. Not long since, some most respectable men ac cused Sir Francis Head of specific acts of misconduct in hi: government of Upper Canada. Ministers said they would inquin into the truth of the charges ; and their mode of inquiry was t< send the statement of his malepraclices to Sir Francis, withe direction to reply to them. Head got up bis case, just as the Sheriff and Under Sheriff of Gloucester got up theirs. Ministers were quite satisfied in both instances. The accused parties bad not found themselves guilty, so of course they were innocent. Il has happened in the Gloucester case, that the accusers have returned to the charge; and as regards the really important question of Sir Francis Head’s behaviour, we expect that the truth will yet one day be fully exposed.
DRURY LANE THEATRE. *^7 /
u Norma," says the sapient manager of Drury Lane Theatre, “is a favourite opera at the King’s Theatre; therefore I will have it translated into English; Schrceder shall play the principal character, and profits will accrue.” Like ancient Pistol, Bunn is destined to disappointment. Norma is a favourite at the King’s Theatre,—that is, a favourite with the singers and the subscribers, but no favourite with the public. The masses have only been put in action this season, spite of the “ unparalleled concentration of talent,” by Mozart. Norma did not fill the pit of Drury Lane the first night, although it had been billed and paragraphed for a month. The frequenters of the Italian Opera rarely undergo the fatigue of judging for themselves: music excites in them neither enthusiasm nor disgust; they are instructed to think Bellini brilliant and Mozart dull, and they obey. The bearers at Drury Lane are a different set of persons. They may, en masse, be as unable to weigh and measure the merits of these two composers, as the kid-gloved and esseneed loungers at the Italian Theatre: the probability is against such a supposition, but it may be so. Still, the former go to hear and to be pleased, and only go when they expect to be pleased : they neither judge nor vote by proxy ; and Mr. Bunn will discover before the week is out, if he have not found out already, that success in the Hay market is no unerring indication of popularity at Drury Lane.
Nornmj too, was the repetition of an experiment that had recently failed at the same place, under more favourable circumstances, inasmuch as Balfe’s opera was superior to Bellini’s. It was another

h r-r «r- —------------—----------
The Indian Girl, a piece produce«! at Drury Lane Theatre on Saturday week, an«! as we thought very thoroughly and deservedly damned, has since, by dint of the criticisms in the Daily New «papers and the Drury Lane bills, been crammed down the throats the few people whose visits to that theatre have shown the extent to which curiosity will go. The Indian Girl, we repeat, was on the firxi night thoroughly condemned, hissed from the stage hut the Tunis says it was “extremely weli received,” and the other papers, reluctantly admitting that it was very much hooted and disapproved of, add that no doubt it will be very attractive, and great numbers of people will go to see it.
We were told by the same authorities that a Miss Charles had played Rosalind and Miss Hardcastlc at this theatre admirably well—we found her an inferior soubrette, wit:! absolutely not a particle of merit ; that a Mr Compton bid fair to fill Liston’: place hi comedy—we found a hardmannered ungenial actor; that Mi Dowton had lost nothing of his old and unrivalled powers—we saw a faded likeness, staggering in step and inaudible in \oice, that was most truly painful; that a Mr Ternan had played Shylock with a masterly skill that fell only short of genius—we entered the theatre jt the «rial scene, and there was a marvellously commonplace person with a memory ar<l dressed like a .lew brow-beaten In a sad Old-Bailey barrist r of a Portia ; that Mr Butler—but ii n not necessary to extend the list, or to say that airy sanction of this Inst gentleman’s pretensions to appear in first-rate parts would more decently have been spared.
Such has been the past, and such the miserable assistance given to it. Promises no less inviting arc held out for the luture. The Chronicle tells us—
** Balfe’s n-w opera at Drury Lane has been laid aside for a little time, in order that a romantic spectacle ot the most splendid description may be brought out, on a scale of magnificence never yet attempted on any stage, in one scene of which there will be 700 people employed. Balfe is composing the music for this wonder of wonders, which is to be produced on Monday next.”
The Times is still more promising and explicit—
“ Balfe'a new opera at Drury Lane has been laid aside for a little time, in order that a romantic spectacle n ay be brought out on a scale of great magnificence, in one scene of which there will be 700 people employed, in addition to forty fior.se.s, besides camels, a,id other animat&. This spectacle is tto be produced on Monday next.”
—Lastly, by way of increasing “ the intense excitement” produced by these impudent pulls * and depriving the poor actors of two
nights' salaries, (for papers and playbills have been equally unavailing in getting more than a few eccentric people into the house, and consequently in providing with any certainty for any person’s salary except the salary of tin “ lessee”) flic following striking announcement was given to the public on Friday : —
Friday, Nov. 3, 1837.
" Theatre Royal, Drury Lane—To the Public- It having been found absolutely impracticable to produce the forthcoming drama with ilia? effect which is expected from the noveltiesintroduced at this establishment [and ufiich the importance of the subject demands), and at the same time to render justice to the nightly perforatum es already announced, the Lessee has deemed it advisable to close the theatre this evening and to morrow, to afford two nights' rehearsal of the grand historical play of CAR \LTACLS, which will be produced on Monday n«-xt, Nov. «>, with every possible attention to costume, scenery, and decorations.”
What all this is meant to lead to, we shall have a speedy opportunity of seeing. U hat we can now see very plain1; is that there is a servile, cold, and degraded disposition in quarters where it might have been least expected, and which would gladly, if it can, keep the stage in its lowest and meanest condition. But tins, we firmly believe, Jt cannot do.
* it is fair to add iliat Drury Lane bod not all tbe puffs to W-L-lr Xhe new its-see of the Haymarket lias degraded the reputation he Dad bt. - rue entitled to for many spirited points of management, by re.-urting to like wretched expedients in tie hope of keeping up a declining season. Hurt: is the last specirn :i oi his efforta in the Morning Chronicle . —“ The Haymarket Theatre still continues to be tie most attractive place of amusement in London. In addition to KLim it s's splendid comedy of the Loie Chase, we have Mr T. P. Cooke’s characteristic portraiture of nautical life : and shortly we may expect Power. Lord and Lady Holland, Lord Harley, Lord Seymour, Sir T. L'sher Sit- B Martin, firanby Cai-craft, Esq , — Montefiore,	&c._. have been constant vi\:t.yrs this week.*
The allusion to Mr Power «ouveys, in a somewhat equivocal shape, a simple and unequivoctl uuirmh, which is snj p ^ei» to have its effect, and i* the'etam resorted to The public may expect Mr Power as long is they please und as vainly, for did not me pert on who penned ¡hia paragraph knoti that Mr Power could iiot	go to the Hay market during its present season?

THEATRICAL
hmn /z.
EXAMINER.
---
v
The impudent puffs of Drury Lane have had an appropriate consummation. The wonder of wonders turned out to be a gross cheat—a fraud too miserable and disgusting to escape exposure even in the Bunn House.
We did not see the first night’s ludicrous exhibition of this Caractacus, but some of our contemporaries, least open to the imputation of undue prejudice, shall furnish an account of it.
The Times says—
“ The audience were completely ennvyed very early in the performance, and expressed their disapprobation in a most unequivocal manner. Independent of the impatience which the delivery of long sententious speeches was calculated to produce, the vile manner in which they were delivered was quite sufficient to excite disgust. With very few exceptions, the acting was insufferably, perhaps, we should rather say, ludicrously bad, and excited shouts o. laughter and hisses in some very serious scenes. *	* Even as a grand
spectacle the undertaking was a failure. Two of the tableaux are exceedingly good; beyond them the scenery hardly deserves notice. * * Tha whole of the early part of the fifth act was a mere matter of dumb-show; not a word could be heard in the midst of a most stormy cry of * Off! off!* and an equally stormy call for ‘the manager !’ who, of course, was deaf to the gentle invitation. We shall now say one word as to the music, which is by Mr Balfe. Its chief characteristic (overture and all) is noise, not expression.”
The Morning Herald is scarcely less flattering—
“ Some few passages in the part of Caractacus, which was sustained by Mr Butler, were listened to and applauded; but the rest was, as we have stated, utter failure. The house at first took the matter in angry dulness, and then in angry mirth, insomuch that the prolix heroics of old Fostkumusy and the melting pathos of Junius, were either enlivened by an epidemic accompaniment of coughing or laughter, both, however, greatly alloyed with the less agreeable sounds of disapprobation. Delays between the acts kept these feelings in full vivacity. *	* The final scene of the whole,
and the intended coup de victoire was, we should say, but an indifferent pageant, erowded enough with glittering soldiers, horses, two or three chariots, a couple of small Brahmin bulls, a camel, and two elephants, almost as good as if alive. The scene was not felicitous, and the general effect of the pageant unreal, incomplete, and common-place. Several times during the evening, a summary verdict appeared about to be passed on this production, and at the conclusion, things looked so inauspicious and menacing, that no attempt was made to announce its repetition.”
The Morning Post, with the same complimentary turn, is still more graphic—
“ It is with no small pain we feel ourselves called upon to say that so fine a subject, even with the assistance of Beaumont and Fletcher, afforded a melancholy, we might rather say, a ludicrous instance of failure. This was the more painful from the promises that were held oot—the length and labour of preparation, and the high hopes thus actually excited in the public mind. *	* Never was manager, author, or audience so woefully
disappointed. The piece almost from beginning to end was dodged at every step by laughter or hisses; and so decided was the manifestation of dislike, that it was not ventured even to announce it for repetition. •	•	• The
fourth act closed, and hitherto all was dulness and disappointment. The decisive struggle at Caer Caradoc had afforded a noble opportunity for a grand battle scene, and all were looking out anxiously for Davis's fine stud of horses. They looked in vain. There were no horses, and very few men, not more than ten or a dozen in each army. Indeed, throughout, considering the nature and objects of the play, there was a melancholy deficiency of troops, two or three men and an officer being made to stand for a legion upon more occasions than nr. The fourth act having closed without producing anything like what the public were led to expect, it was supposed that the decisive effort would be made in the fifth act, in which Caracfacus was to be led captive into the presence of the Emgieror. More than twenty minutes elapsed. Expectation was upon the stretch, looking out for something grand and illuminated, when, lo ! the drop is raised, and a dingy scene—an old house, or something of the kind, presents itself to view, with Tribune Brindat before it again upon his love affair. There was a universal shout of laughter, followed by hisses, at which the poor Tribune appeared much amazed and disappointed. *	* We
left the house under an impression that the play was withdrawn. There was no formal announcement to that effect; but there was a long silence, which may be looked upon as equivalent to it.**
We saw the second performance of this wretched absurdity, by luch devices crammed down the throats of a scanty audience. It had been reduced to an awful extent ; Mr Cooper, Mr Blindai, and others, taken bodily out of it ; and with the greatest difficulty was thinly scattered over the space of three acts of little more than twenty minutes each in duration. The effect was exquisitely ludicrous. We saw an uninterrupted series of private interviews— two or three Britons coming on, and going off to make way for two or three Romans—all traces of Beaumont and Fletcher (on whose play of Bonduca the original exhibition was founded) gone, or peeping out here and there with the sickliest look from beneath the miserable rags and patches thrown over them—Mr Butler striding about the stage with the most wearisome sawing and sing song, indescribably pompous and unimpressive ; and, by way of illustrating the fidelity to costume for which thetheatre and its caterer on this occasion are both said to be celebrated, dressed in bright scarlet and gold, while his brother, Mr Howell, carried a club, and displayed a variegated cotton shawl over his shoulders, with blue cotton breeches and black boots on his lower extremities. Such were the fragments into which the “ grand historical play” had dwindled. Anything more contemptible was never suffered to insult the audience of a theatre. It was no bad proof of the character of the whole thing that the only person applauded was “ a young gentleman ” who spoke the words of the boy Hengo like a practised middle-aged gentleman. The lad is clever, and very like Mr Keeley. We must add, in justice to the Messrs Grieve, whose talents we highly respect, that the scene of the “ British Dracontium ” and the painting of the gallery and its occupants in the last scene, are masterly specimens of the art.
We are sorry that Mr Planché has so much of the sin of this flagrant affair to answer for. When we heard of Beaumont and Fletcher’s Muse among the Drury Lane people it was impossible not to think of the unfortunate lady among the Satyrs, hut we did not reckon on Mr Planché presiding at the repulsive exhibition. It is really very pitiful, and we repeat that we are sorry for it. It is charity to say no more. We will at once close our account with an appropriate specimen of the adapter’s additions to Beaumont and Fletcher, mouthed out with very considerable boldness by Mr Butler in the wretched last scene. “ Soon,” observed that gentleman, in a fine prophetic spirit, “ soon the bloody scene shall end—
“ And dull oblivion Let fall its mantle o’er Cabactacus!”
We have only room at present for a passing word on Macbeth, as produced at Covent Garden on Monday last. Dull oblivion, as Mr Planché very properly expresses it, will do its work so speedily on Caractaaus, that it was necessary to record the cheat at once. This performance of Macbeth is sure to have frequent repetition to the very close of the season, and to afford as frequent opportunities for notice. The manner of its production will be referred to hereafter as an era in the history of stage performances. We might assert very confidently that nothing at all like it has been seen upon the stage. It was a consummation of the art.
• It woald he unjust in mentioning the lies of the bills to omit all allusion to tberowers of face and of invention with which an eccentric individual in tha Globe, aftar professing to describe the first night of Caractacus, gravelv observed—“ It is needless to add that the piece was completely successful.
A simple impression this to trust to in a matter concerning Drury Lane Theatre—an impression founded on some sense of the decencies! When the dead folks of the burlesque proposed to “live again to-morrow ” it was with the modest condition—“ and if your worships please”— but no such thing was dreamt of here. The following were the deliberate lies of the two next days’ bills—*
“ The splendid manner in which the grand historical play of Caractacus has been produced having been admitted by the acclamations of a crowded and fashionable audience, will be repeated every evening nntil further notice.” “The triumphant success or the new historical plat has so surpassed the expectations of the management as to
SUPERSEDE ALL OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS !”
Such impudent falsehood we were quite prepared for. Where there is no decency what matters exposure ? And as Mr Burke very finely says, “ cheats and deceivers never can repent.” The fraudulent have no resource but in fraud. They have no better expedient to which, in a disappointment concerning the profitable effects of fraud and cunning, they can ever retreat. The exposure of an old falsehood serves only to put them on the invention of a new.

Theatre Roy at,
nr. BALFE’s OPERA
JOAN of ABO
$ST Instead, of announcing the reception of this Opera by outrageous exaggerations in the Play Bills, the Lessee will trust to the impression carried away by the Audience, and to the opinion of the Public Press, an analysis of which is herewith subjoined:—
I-ast eight a new grand historical opera, called Joan of Are, was produced at this theatre. The music is by Mr. M. W. Balfk. Whethe.-the hij'i reputation which Mr. Balfe has already acquired, or the hope of a splendid military spectacle, which the very name of the piece i aturaily produces, or both combined, operated upon the public expectation, certain it is that before the rising of the curtain the house was tilled. The overture contains many passages of high merit, and was loudly applauded and encored. The opening chorus of the first act is of a bold and martial character. The concerted pieces in this act were supported » ith great spirit. Miss Rower's openh g solo, “ Ere the purple curl.flower,” was simple and chaste iu composition, and effectively given. It contrasted well with the iLspiied feeling to which Joan gives utterance in the quick movement, “ Hut the trumpet shall sound on the tower.” In this Miss Hoses exerted all her powers. The air vu spirited and appropiiate. and enthusiastically applauded. The recitative preceding the vision of Si. Catherine, “ Oh, for some sign,” with harp Hicomaauiiuent. was of a very pleasing character. Joan’t address to theKiug was full of inspiration—it was executed with great brilliancy by Mis, H imes, consideration for whom prevented its encore. A lively duet between Billet and Madelon fSuavts aid Miss Poole), showed the cot .poser’s versatility of talent, and appeared to afford the audience an agreeable relief from the more serious portion of the music. It wav given v»*lh great spirit and archness and but for its length would have been demanded a second time. The chorus of Monks forming the opening of the finale to the first act; Joan's solo at the tomb of St. Catherine ; the sol i expressive of her gratitude on obtaining possession of the inspired he'met, shield and banner; and the grand chorus which terminates the act, are all written in a very superior style, and told well. A recitative and air beginning The beams which fill those gentle eyes.” allotted to Dunois (Templeton ), is one of the gems of the opera. It is extremely elegant in point of composition, and was most admirably sung. The call for its repetition was unanimous, and Temhets* gave it the seeond time with increased effect. Had there been nothing else in the opera of merit this alone would have saved it. A duet belwee , Miss Rover and Bvlfe. coinmescing, “ O'er shepherd pipe, and dell,” was also extremely well sui g. The blending of the voices and the judicious manner in which the accompaniment was kept down, made this piece very effective. A beautiful ballad, tastefully surg by B.vlfe. 1 The peace of the valley is fled,” bids fair to rival his ” Light of other days,'* and “ The cottage near Rochelle;” it, however, «ssentially differs from either of these favourite productions. In the third act the principal morceaux that struck us wero a charming duet hetwee Burs and Miss Roxeh, “ Forsaken I no, thou art not” (in our opinion, the prettiest piece in the opera) ; another duet between Beauvais and Joan, and the concluding scena. Balfe has produced an opera which will not only add to his already high reputation, but be the means of filling the treasury of the theatre. Miss Rover's acting and singing were far superior to anything she has yet attempted, and this is no ii significant eulogium.—Morning Post. Dec. 1.
A new grand opera, called Joan of Arc, the music by Balfe, was produced last night; it contains many taking and spirited pieces. The most successful were a solo, with chorus, by Miss Rotner, " The trumpet shall sound,” which is likely to prove a favourite, and a song by Templeton, “ Dear Maid, while thou art sleeping.” Others were received with more or less approbation, but these were unquestionably the gems of the evening. Miss Romer was the Joan of Arc. and her singing was remarkably powerful and energetic. The piece, which contained many striking situations, and much good scenery (particularly the arming of Joan in the church of St. Catherine, and the riew of the Cathedral at Rouen), closed with—not the death, but—the rescue of Joan, who was freed from the stake by the French, and united to her lover. Unanimous applause followed the fall of the curtain. The house was crowded.— Timss—Dec. lit.
Balfe’s new opera of Joan of Arc was repeated last evening with increased effect. There has been that curtailment of the ordinary exu-lierauces of a first night which appeared necessary, and the general execution was consequently excellent. From the several encores which were accorded during the evening, there is no doubt of the music becoming popular. The opera is prepared on a splendid scale, and with the adjunct of the new ballet is calculated to run at least till Christmas.—Times—Dec. 2nd.
DRURY LANE.—Balfe’s Opera, Joan of Arc, was brought out on Thursday night with great splendour, and with great success.—In the Music there are many excellent things. The sestetto in the opening scene “ Hark, the pealing thunder,” is a fine piece of descriptive music, with yery powerful orchestral effects The chorus of peasants. *• Freedom to our country still,” is a noble burst of enthusiasm. The solo.
“ But the trumpet shall sound on the tower,” was deservedly encored with acclamations. The religious music in the chapel of St. Catherine, is in a grand and solemn ecclesiastical style. The most beautiful morceau. in our apprehension, is the trio, ” Hark ! ’tis the soul-exciting drum,” in the second act, sung by Balfe, Giubelei, and Seguin, The harmony of the three bass voices, accompanied only by the vioieiicellos and deep toned wind instruments, is charming. We have heard few finer things than this trio, which receives additional interest from its subject haying been previously heard in the introduction to the overture. Balfe sang a ballad, “ The peace of the valley is fled,” with an accompaniment for the cornet a piston, in a similar style to “The light of other days;” it is very pleasing. Too much praise cannot be given to the scenery, costumes, and decorations. The interior of the cathedral, and the market-place, the scene of Joan’s intended execution, were most magnificent —Morning Chronicle and Bril’s Life.
DRURY LANE.—On Thursday night, Mr. Balfe's Opera of Joan of Are, was produced at this theatre. There is a good deal of brilliancy in the dressing of this opera, and in its scanes. Mr. Balfe has poured himself forth lavishly on this occasion. The opera abounds in solo, duet, and every kind of concerted piece. In all there is great spirit, with marked originality. In some he is particularly happy both in melody and rich combination. The whole of the choral music of the scene in St. Catherine’s Church is solemn and striking. The comic duet betwaen Badrt (Mr. Seguin) and Madelon (Miss Poole), and that between Badet and Renaud (Giubileij, are both amongst Mr. Balfe’s happiest efforts. The ballad •* The Peace of the Valley,” sung by Mr. Balfe himself, is very beautiful, and very similar to “ The Light of Other Days.” The piston trumpet imparts to each a peculiar family likeness Templeton enjoys the almost sinicure part of Dm.ois. He sings in it a very pretty serenade—“Woman, thine the lute,” the light and graceful introduction to which, by Eliasou, was warmly applauded. Some of the minor concerted pieces of the opera are richly harmonized. On the whole Mr. Halfe's portion of this opera is calculated to make it a favourite for lorne time, and to reflect new honour upon himself. He was called for at the fall of the curtain, and vehemently applauded—a compliment also extended to Miss Roiner, who sang with her usual expressiveness and sincerity.—Morning Herald and Observer.
Again most cordially do we congratulate Mr. Balfe. The extraordinary success wmen lias attainted me representations of uts new Opera. loan of Arc, must be gall and wormwood to his contemplable calumniators. It is, however, an invariable attendant upon true genius to be assailed by every species of detractors ; and oftentimes has rising talent been discouraged, if not destroyed, by the venomous efforts of such reptiles. We were satisfied, from Mr. Balfe’s first introduction to the public as an author, that he possessed not only true genius, but that with)it, he combined a thorough knowledge of the science of his divine art, and a most devoted attachment to it. These combinations seldom centre in one person—more rarely still have they been exhibited by our native composers ; but we hope for, and expect, much better things from our countrymen in this department of the arts. The columns of this Journal shall ever be open to render them every asisstance, when we can conscientiously do so, in promoting the advancement of the British school of music. It is just two short years since Mr. Balfe presented himself before the tribunal of a British public as an operatic writer; and in that brief period bis genius has produced, and that tribunal has received with loud acclamations of favor, four most decidedly successful operas. “ Industry and perseverance,” says the ild adage, “overcome all difficulties,” and we have the most convincing evidence that Mr. Balfe not only knows, but that he appreciates the moral it contains. His contemporaries may rely upon it as the only royal path to «minertce, and by which alone I he summit, or even a distinguished position, can be attained. We feel assured that our readers will, upon subsequent representations, be, as we are, delighted with the composition as a whole, knowing that through the progress of the opera they will hear every subject of tiiat overture when allied to the “ human voice divine,” eliciting the most rapturous applause of a delighted audience. These charming subjects would establish the fame of any writer, even if no others were produced. But when the recollection dwells upon the many beauties which successive representations will more clearly develope, w e think the fame of Mr. Balfe will be extended much more bv this one opera than by any which has proceeded from tiis pen. It is not upon the instrumentation of this opera that we would base our opinion—it is not upon isolated and detached portions of this opera that we hazard this opinion—it is not upon a single ballad, nor upon a single concerted piece, that we rely on the public to affirm our proposition—but it is upon the whole opera, as a work of art, from the first opening of the overture to the finale of that opera, that our opinion has its foundation.—Sun.
The long talked-of •• New grand Opera,” Joan of Arc, by Balfe, was prodneed at Drury L»ne last night, witk a degree of splendour and «Sect that does great credit to the tasie as well as liberality of the management —The Music throughout the piece is of a high character, nany of the melodies remarkably sweet and pleasing, and the harmonic combinations such as to add to the well-earned laurels of the composer, whose previous efforts have long since placed him in the first rank of British aitiats. Templeton's song towards the end ef the second act, “ Dear maid, while thou art gleeping,” is one of his happiest hits, and will, beyond all question, be a popular ballad but it is in the concerted pieces that the skill of the musician is shown to the greatest advantage. Miss Romer was most effective in the hernia«, and was repeatedly encored, as were several of the other performers in varies airs. 1 he opera is most superbly got up, and the effect of Btrieve's beautiful acenery much heightened by the assiatance of ” a new and extraordinary light.” Nothing could be more en'ireiy triumphant than the success of the Opera which was received throughout with the londest applause by a very full house, and will, no donbt,

If we we re to judge of the value of Mr. Balfe's new composition by the loud and incessant peals of approbation which followed every passage last night, we should say that he had achieved for himself a great accession of reputation in the minds of the crowded auditory assembled; but we should be doing him and the public an injustice by adopting that criterion, Mr. Balfe’s knowledge of music, scientific as well as practical, his grammatical acquirements, and his accomplished taste, caunot but enable him to compose a clever, effective, and well wrought-up opera. 'I he production of last night will sustain, if it do not really add to, his already well-earned reputation. The overture to Joan of Are comprises a series of movements, many of them characterised by much skill in instrumentation. The effect of the whole was animated and striking—so mush so, that the overture was re-demanded. The opening chorus, “Oh, how glorious a battle !” was admirably descriptive, and spiritedly Ming; aswas the chorus led by Mr. Seguin and Miss Poole, beginning, “ Prime the cup of honest welcome I” which cleverly depicted the exuberance of jovial feeling. Miss Romer personated the heroine, Joan. Her first scena descriptive oi the sorrowsof France, and of the blood that must be shed before she regains her freedom, u Ere the purple cornflower.” and the happiness and liberty wh’ch she predicts, “ But the trumpet shall sound on the tower,” were two fine compositions, and characteristically distinct ; the first breathing deep feeling and pathos, the latter glowing with all the enthusiasm of the most fervent hope. Miss Romer was heartily applauded for the exquisite skill and talent whieh she displayed, Balfe, as Theodore, the lover, of Joan, sang his own music expressively, aud contributed much in giving due effect to tbe numerous mcerted pieces with which the opera abounds: to these, and to two or three melodies sung by Templeton, Giubilei, Seguin, Anderson, and Miss Poole, we shall again refer. Meantime, suffice it to say, that the opera was quite successful, and was ably performed by the band, chorusses, and the above named vocalists. After the fall of the curtain, Mr. Balfe and Miss Romer were loudly called for ; in obedience they appeared a d acknowledged the thanks bestowed upon them. The opera was announced for repetition amidst loud and general appiause.—Mg. Advertiser.
The opera opens with the exterior of an inn named “ The Silver Lily," kept by Rcnastd, (Mr. Giubilei), the uncle of Joan, (Miss Rorner), nere a beautiful sestette is introduced, with a chorus of peasants, which elicited unqualified applause. At this moment the inspired Maid enters and proclaims that she is destined to give freedom to France. In the course of this scene Miss Romer sung the solo, “ But the trumpet snail sound on the tower,” in the purest style and sweetest expression:—to our taste this is the gem of the opera. By the King’s command Jean is conducted to the chapel of SI. Catherine, where, as had been foreshewn her by the saint, she discovers the sacred banner and the armour which she is to wear in battle. This scene was extremely well executed, and the striking effect produced by the grouping of while sioled priests, mail-clad warriors,and courtiers in dazzling costumes, was heightened by the solemn ehaunt of the monks, to which the accompaniment of a full-toned organ lent its powerful aid. The heroic Maid enters the tomb, and investing herself with the invincible casque and shield, re-appears suddenly amongst the astonished spectators, who kneel before her, and the act terminates with a repetition of tbe teautiful solo to which we have alluded, and a very effective chorus. Tbe second act is taken up with the successful machinations of the traitor Xantilles to betray Joan,and she is condemned to the stake. The scene of the horrid sacrifice is the last in the piece—it is well managed : the light streaming through the stained windows of an adjoining church, and the pale moonlight thrown on ihe distant multitude who are «waiting the execution, produce a capital effect. However, just as the torch has been applied to the pile, and the flames begin to ascend around their victim, the English troops rush in, Theodore snatches Joan from the stake, and tbe piece terminates with a triumphal group and norus. Mr. Giuhilei sang a spirited ballad, “ Might I march through life again,” with considerable effect; and in the second act there incurs a delightful little recitative by Templeton, followed by a sweet air, “ Dear maid when thou art sleeping,” which was loudly encored. It would be unjust not to notice the exquisite prelude on the violin, which introduced this song. Mr. Balfe had also a very pretty ballad, “The peaceof the valley is fled,” which he sang with great taste. As a whole the music of tbe opera is good, the instrumental passages are particularly brilliant and effective. The audience paid a just tribute to the talents of the composer and principal vocalist, and at the close of the piece called for Mr. Balfe and MissRnmer, who appeared before the curtain, aud received the undivided applause and gratulalions of a densely crowded and fashionable house.—Sunday Timet.
Halfe’s Opera of Joan of Arc, contains soma of the most delicious mortcaux he has yet composed—foremost amongst which msy he class«*! When the pnrple cornflower,” leading into the inspiring air and choius, “But the trumpet shall sound,’’ which is aho is the overture, and very admirably brought us at the finale of the first act. Then a comic song being comically sung by Segnin—an exquisite ballad as exquisitely *aag by Templetosi—another ballad likely to become popular, called “ The Peace of the Valley,” but not likelv t« be jo popular as the one on which it is evidently founded The Dufct of “ Rustic pipe and shepherd dell” is full ef melody; and the finale to the sicend act com-pfetely sustains the action ot the piece. There is an amusing and well executed duet between Segoin and Giubitei, and a trio, perhaps the gem of tbe Opera, by Balfe, Seguin, and Giubilei. Miss Homer’s scena in the dungeun, is a fine composition; but the subsequent duet might certainly be dispensed with.
The finale to the piece. “ Oh, ecstacy.” is a delightful melody, likely to be on the organs in a very few days. We have not space to say what we wish ofthe singers ; and where all exerted themselves so well, the selection of one may appear invidious ; but certainly no praise can be too great for Miss Romer, whose personation of Joan of Arc was perfect. Had Miss Romer no reputation before, her performance aud her dnging, in this character, would have placed her at the top of her profession. There has been no opera in our recollection so well appointed as Joan of Arc. The costumes are perfect historical pictures, the banners hang out from the walls in ail the pomp nf baronial emblazonnry, and the scenes seem solid buildings. We do not think it in the power of artists to surpa-s the “ Shrine of St. Catherine,’’ the ‘-View of Orleans,” and the “ Market Place at Rouen,” which last, taken altogether, is Ihe cumpletest delusion we have seen. The opera, and the new Ballet of the. Daughter of the Danube, will float the good ship “ Drury” till the Christmas carols are sung and rung.—The Age.
On Thursday evening we witnessed Joan of Arc at Drury Lane, and probably the vocal and instrumental talent engaged at this establihment was never displayed to greater advantage. The music is by Balfe, and is infinitely superior ta any thing he has ever written. There is one nelody song by Templeton worth the whole of The Siege of Rochelle, and it was as beautifully executed as the Muses themselves could ha-.e desired. The burthen, if we caught it aright, was “ Dear Maid, while thou art sleeping'” The air will doubtless be ground ou every barrel-rgan within a week, but every person who wishes toappreciate its beauty must hear Templeton sing it. The concerted music is characterised by a degree of originality for which few have given Balfe credit, and several of the solos—as given by the other principals—will stamp the composer at once as a thorough musician. The part of Joan was performed by Miss Romer with more than her wonted ability. Miss Pooie Anderson, Giubilei and Seguin, contributed mainly to the success of an opera which cannot fail to '* bring money.” The orchestra was admirably I'd by Eliason, whose accompaniment to Templeton’s song was worthy of the manner in which it was sung. Jt was chaste—yet brilliant. The tcenery was just what we might have expected from the Grieves—truly beautiful. The dresses, properties, and eppointments of every description were faultless, aud nothing of this description has ever been managed at Drury Lane on a better scale.—Weekly Dispatch.
We will avail ourselves on this oecasion, of a notice of a writer in the Chronicle. There are many excellent things in the opera. The vestetto in the opening scene, “ Hark ! the pealing thunder,” is a fine piece of descriptive music, with very powerful orchestral effects. The chorus of peasants, Freedom to oar country still.” is a noble burst of euthusiam. The solo, “ Bu> the trumpet shall sound on the tower.” «as deservedly encored with acclamations. The religious music in the chapel of St. Catherine isina grand and solemn ecc'esiastical style. 'I ha most beautiful morceau, in our apprehension, is the trio, “ Hark, ’tis the soul, exciting drum.” in the second act, sung by Batfe, Giubilei, snd ,seguin.—The Examiner.
The aew opera, called Joan of Arc, which has been so long announced, was produced on Thursday evening ; and it may be said to have been decidedly successful. The mosie is, as a whole, pleasing—in some parts decidedly taking. Miss Romer ewerted herself much, and was called fur at the end with Mr. Balfe, and cheered across the stage in the (now) usual manner. Mr. Templeton and the remainder of ti*e performers-— not forgetting little Miss Poole, who sung a comic duet with Mr. Segoin, very cleverly and effectively—did their best to contribute to Ike success of the opera. Some of the scenery is very beautiful, and does honour to the Messieurs Grievel—Athenerum
On Thursday night Joan of Arc, was produced at this Theatre. The manager very naturally depended for success, in a great measure upon music, and upon the high name of Mr- Balfe. He was not disappointed. The opera was completely triumphant. Had he rested his hopes upon shew and scenery, there was mnch to praise. Mr. Balfe and Miss Romer (who performed the part of Joan of Arc with a great effeet) were called for at the close, and loudly applauded.—Bell's Weekly Messenger.

DRURY LANE.
The few words we gave the other week to Mr Balfe’s opera of Joan of Arc have been quoted in the playbills of this theatre, among the notices of other papers, as praise. But for this circumstance, which has not, however, at all surprised us, we should have thought it needless to say a word more about the opera in question, for the thing is so utterly worthless that criticising it at all is a loss of time. We shall now merely place our opinion a little more emphatically on record, that hereafter there may be no mistake about it.
Thus much, then. We have described the verse and prose part of the production as the merest trash, but we must add that we are not unwilling to acquit Mr Balfe in this opera of that old charge of plagiarism to which by this time he must be pretty well accustomed. It is all his own—that is, unless some unhappy publisher, “ duped by a name,” has already pledged himself to exchange notes with him. The exception we allude to is in the duet between Badet and Renaud in the third act, which is nearly note for note a copy of C'occia's comic duet “ Mentre Francesco.” In the original the music is pretty enough, and is adapted to the words ; but in Joan of Arc it is quite clear that the effect of imitating such a “ motivo ” must be truly ridiculous, being set to words descriptive of the taking of a fortress, which of course has an immense deal to do with Coccia’s original idea of concocting a basin of broth.
Mr Balfe’s school of writing has always been founded upon the very worst model, namely, that introduced by the successors and puerile imitators of Rossini (a long list of worthies), and this Joan of Arc is a rare instance of how far such a school may be carried, where sound is substituted for sense, jumps and unmeaning flights for tender expression, and noise and clamour for dignity and grandeur. Joan of Arc is, in short, the worst of this author's productions, and we hope it may be the last we shall be doomed to listen to. If anybody should deem we are severe or prejudiced, let them buy a book of the opera, and (always attending to the meaning of what is attempted to be conveyed therein) try and sit it out for one evening.
We take the following passages (they are the first that occur to us, and will serve as a pretty just criterion of the whole) as specimens of adaptation of music to words, and as proving the subtle intellect and refined imagination of this “ Great Master." In the third act Joan has to sing the following words :—
“ My name amidst thy peaceful vales,
Must, like those flow’rs, decay,
And, in its dawn of early Spring,
So fall! so fade away !
Uow this is poor enough in its way . but what would the enthusiastic public think (if they were not too idle to search for the truth) of a composer who shall to the last strain of this verse introduce an accompaniment of cymbals ! ! Such is the fact.
Again, Theodore sings—
“ Peace to the souls of the brave 1 In brighter spheres rewarded—
Sweet pity's tear bedew their grave !
Their deeds by Fame recorded !”
Any common-place person might suppose that the melody adapted to these words would assume a plaintive character, and that the accompaniments ought to express something of this feeling also , but this is an ignorant mistake, at least so Mr Balfe would have us believe, for the air he has set to these words is positively in jumping allegro time, and with a drum accompaniment to boot!!!
Yet this is nothing; we might multiply instances like these at every tenth bar ; in fact, from beginning to end the whole thing is an outrage upon common sense. We should advise the management (seriously) to withdraw it for a time, and get some clever person on the establishment, as soon as possible, to turn the thing into a pantomime, for which we think some of the music might serve, and no doubt this would be the means of saving a great deal of expense at Christmas, in dresses, decorations, &c. &c. The overture certainly, and the opening chorus (introduced just before the Harlequin and Clown change their dresses) would do admirably for a Jack and the Bran Stalk, and the symphony to “ The Peace of the Valley,” on the cornopean, as it is now written, might be played as Jack goes up the bean ladder. The finale, too, being a waltz, would do exceedingly well as the finale to the pantomime, and then the corps dramatique, as a novelty, might sing and waltz at the same time.
The Daughter of the Datmbe continues to be played. The dancing is excellent, and. Mr Wieland is really a man of genius in his way.
