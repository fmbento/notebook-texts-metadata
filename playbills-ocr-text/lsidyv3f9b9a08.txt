THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
Am- n /?dV Drury-Lau.
On Saturday evening the ferious opera of Artaxerxes was revived at this theatre; the parti of which were thus cail:
Arbaces,
Artaxerxes,
Rhnenes,
Artabanes,
Semira,
Mandane,
This muftcal chef d’ oeuv re of the late Dr. Arm, has been got up with a great deal of attention, Difclaiming as v/e do the idea of countenancing foreign exotics on the Engliili ftage, yet we readily allow, that we never remember the part of Arbaccs better fuftaiaed throughout, than it was in the prefen t irrftance by Prudom ; for though her voice is rather deficient in point of power, that is amply compenfated by her tafte Ind judgment. Mrs. Baddely’s vocal talents were never employed to fo much advantage rs they were in Artaxerxes: fhe fuhg all her airs with great feeling, particularly, “In it fancy our tales and fears,” which touched, and was en-chored by every auditor.—Mifs Wright made a decent Hand in Semira. As to Mifs Phillips, who ijiade her firft appearance in Mandant, it would not be right to form a hafty judgment of her abilities from this eflay, becaufe the .was evidently too much embarraued by hep fears to do juftice to her powers. She feems t« pofiefa a good pipe, as well as a picafing figure and lmndfcme face, but the has yet to learn how to fet either oft" to proper advantage. The part of Artabanes was finely fung and ailed by Mr. Vernon; but we do not think a fiffitlar compliment due to the exertions of Mr. Dubel-lamv.	_	- _	‘
The feveral characters were fplendidlv habited,' by the affiitance of Signior Lupeno, the Opera-Jioufe t?”lor. It is a pity but the ihoe-maker had brought the flippers of Arhaces and Arlaxerz.cs time enough for the performance, as it would have prevented"the ludicrous appearance thofe temporary bents made, by being obliged to wear their own female ihocs throughout the firil ail of the piece.	,
The opera was delightfully accompanied by the Orcheflra, who performed the Ch erture in a very finifhed ftvle; though wc think their future performance would not fuller by the dmllt Lafs playing a little more in Piano !

Alarmed at his impending ruin, Mrs. Courtly refolves to reclaim him. She had tried ■ very expedient that love could fuggeft, but to no purpofe.

Sir Harry’s chief reliance, after the lofs of his own fortune, is on an old uncle, who is in the country. He perfuadcs him, by his letters, to think that he has renounced all his extravagant habits, and the old man, in {us joy at fuch an event, refolves to pay him a vifit in town. He arrives on the very day that Sir Harry had appointed to give a magnificent entertainment to his friends. Undeceived by this circumftance, and incenfed at being impofed on by his nephew, he refolves to difinherit him, and to leave his fortune to Mrs. Courtly, who is next relation.
Tiiis (he at firft oppofes, but afterwards con-fents to, in order to accomplifh her own plan.
At the fame time fhe directs Supple to engage the Baronet in a party at Piquet with her, to let her into his hand, and to take advantage of his warm, impatient temper, and urge him to rifqne all he pofleffed. She then takes care to inform him of his uncle’s having d¡/inherited him, and continues to treat him with indifference.
Thus reduced to diftrefs, Sir Harry enters. He has recourfe to his friends, but they refule him affillance. Dar'tnda forfakes him, and Supple adds infult to his ingratitude.

/L (k~U.'<- ¿u- 13
The death of Mr. Hopkins, who was the prompter of Mr. Garrick, during the latter part of his management of Drury-lane theatre, is an additional inftance that theatrical potentates do not long outlive their theatrical fovereignty. Mr. Hopkins quitted his office cf King of the Rehearfals unwillingly laft fumrner, and he has died this winter. Mr. Garrick outlived his management not quite two feafons; Mrs. Pritchard furvived her bidding farewell to the ftage but a few months. Quin’s is the only name that can be cited, to prove that an actor has within the laft half century retired from the llage in eafy circumftances, and lived comfortably for a feries of years together. The refult of this article is, that the majority of the ¿ifft-faUcrt of the modern ftage, are in fome degree juftifiable for their heedlefsnefs of their private concerns : AJbort life and a merry one feems to be their favourite motto.
« New Comic Opera, called the Lord of the manor, was per-ormedfor the full time at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, on Wednpfday evening December 27th.
The charatiers of the Drama were hus reprefented:

FABLE.
SIR John Contraft, an affluent com-noner, remarkable for his obftinacy, is well in error as in reflitude, but leferibed as having an excellent heart, ■las difearded his eldeft fon, and dif-n herited him for marrying without his conlent a woman, whom he tenderly loved, but who had no fortune. In the moment of his anger he lent this fon a bank note of 1000I. and infilled upon never feeing him again. Contrail, fcnfible of his father’s immoveable obftinacy, leaves the part of the country in which his father lived, and having taken his wife with him to a diftant county, affumes the name of Raihley, enters upon a farm, and by honeft in-duftry lives in perfect happinefs and content till his wife’s death, which did not take place till ihe had blefled him with two daughters. Nearly twenty years after he had quitted his father’s,
Sir John becomes a purchaler of the manor-houle and domain, of his fon’s landlord, and at this period of time the opera commences.—Contraft reveals to his friend Rental, the fteward of the manor, his real name and fitu-atlon, and laments the unfortunate circumftances of his father’s coming to refide at the manor-houfe, in con-fequence of which he fhall be under the neceflity of changing his place of refidence, and removing once more to a diftance. Rental, a plain, lenfible, and worthy charafler, diffuades him from this refolution, bidding him hope for a happy turn in his affairs, and informing him that his father has a fon born fince he retired, who has been bred up under the idea of being made Sir John’s heir. This new brother, is hourly expefled to arrive, and he de-icribes him as a man of modern faffiion, and a complete reprefentative of the prefent coxcomb in high life. His de-feription is corroborated by the fudden entrance of the younger Contrail’» valet, who, in compliance with the prevailing prejudices among the ravin favour of foreign fervants, has refigned the plain name of Homellall, and alopted the continental appellation of Le Lippe. LeLippe recognizes Rental immediately, as an old town acquaintance, and, at his define, introduces Contrail to a perfefl acquaintance with the manners cf his mailer, by drawing his picture in ftriking colours —the piflrne is lcarcely finilhed, before the original appears. After a colloquy in which the rationality of the elder brother’s fentiments, and the folly of the younger’s general condufl, are forcibly contralled, the latter is called afide by Le Lippe, and informed, that in the adjoining cottage (the refidence of the fuppofed former Raihley) he has

With entire new Muiic, Scenes, Drelles, and Decorations.
Ac fount of the NewPantouime called Harlequin Free-Mason, performed at Covent Garden ^''ratre for thefirfi time on Friday evening the iyth of December.
THE opening feene of this entertainment is conformable to an opinion held by all free-mafons, “ that the original of architeilure is taken from that great building, Manieveral ma-fpns are difeovered at work on a figure, reprefenting a man, compoled of the different orders of architeflure, as The Head of the Compofite Arms	Corinthian
Body	Ionic
Thighs	Doric
Legs	T ufcan
On the mafonic fignal for leaving work, they depart, wh.n ihe reprefen-tative of Hiram Abbiff (grand warden to King Solomon, and his alfillant in building the temple) enters.—From the aforefaid Hone figure be produces an harlequin j gives him a maion’s apron, inftrufls him in the ufe of tools, and endues a trowel with magic power, which (like the cullomary fword) is to affillhim in all his difficulties: then he leaves him. Harlequin’s firft fight of Coloinbine (who is the daughter of a jew) is with her father, whilehe is fur-veying a houfe (which he is about to have built) juft rifing from the foundation. Harlequin and Colombine (as ufual) are reciprocally enamoured at fight; and the full proof he makes of e virtue of his trowel, is t>y ihowing tli ha ilding completed at a ! Mid).
Jn the general aftoniihn.ent at this miracle, Harlequin finds means to Ileal Colombine from her father; who, however, recovers her foon after, and introduces her to a Dutch lover, w'-om he willies her to marry. _	.
Various amufing incidents aril’e among the comic elm actors.
The fecond ext tion of Harlequin s trowel is|ainong a group of peafants at
the Alps, By raifingthe temple of Bacchus ; antLthe next, by a reprefentation of the aloe fhown in the wooden building in Covent Garden.
Many more adventures are introduced, and changes of feenery; particularly a froft feene in Holland, with (kaiters; a tumultuous fea; and a Court of Juilice changed to the market at Bil-lingfgate, and the whole interfperfed with occafional airs, catches, and choruffes, till Hiram Abbiff again appears, and obtains the old jew’s conftnt to the marriage of Harlequin and his daughter. This point fettled, he fignifies the neceffity of his attendance at a grand lodge, it being the ariniverfary feaft to inftall a new Grand Mailer ¿J the ancient and noble order of Free and Accepted Mafons. This naturally introduces a ProceJJion; wherein, by a re-gularfucceffion of all the princtpalGrand Matters, from Enoch to the prefent time, the antiquity, advancement, and dignity of mafonry, are illuftrated in a pleafingand inilruitive manner.
Bcfides the introduflion of the capital charaflers (an explanation whereof, together with that of their refpeilive pageants, is very properly fubjoined to the printed longs) the whole is embel-lifhed with fume linking hiftorical events in the reign of our own kings ; particularly Edward III. and his for. the Black Prince, releafing John, king of France, and his fon, who were made captives at the battle of CrelTy Queen Elizabeth taking the Mafons un del her proteflion ; Guy Vaux’s intend ed confpiracy difeovered; Sir Robt Viner’s whimfical addrefs toCha/les Ii. at Guildhall, and the humiliatei Dutch imploring him to grant them peace.
The magnificence and fplendor of the procefficn exceeds all defeription It is the moil fuperb fpeclacle that ha: been exhibited for many years, an< draws an immenfe concourte of peopl every night, part of whom are necei larily difappointed, the houfe fil ' ling almoft as foon as the doors ar opened.

fin e, that they bear a very fmall proportion. Nor, am I fo full of my own notion, as not to be fenfible that the feme man will have different motives for Marriage at different periods of his life. Bafiard, a poet of fome ingenuity and conceit, has the following Latin epigram on his three wives :
1Terrta mibi variis ¿uEla eft eetatibus uxor, Hac Jmient, ilia viro, tertia nupta fern.
Prime eft propter opus, tcneris mibijunEla fub aim«,
Altera propter opes, tertia propter optm. The meaning of which is, he married the firft in youth for love; the fecond in manhood for money; the third in old age for a nurfe.
But I fpeak of Marriage as it moft frequently happens, taking a view of mankind in general; of Marriage by which the world is continually furnifh-
ed with new fupplies of people 5 and I maintain that we owe it to the natural defire which is fo exceedingly ftrong and prevalent. The motive of ipiereft affefts buta very limited number. The celebrated line in Garth's epilogue to Cato
“ ’Tis bril repenting in a coach and fix,"
is thefentiment of a fine lady, and there are compyatively fpeaking but few fine ladies. I have found an excellent contrail to it, which I confider as the fen-timent of women whofe palSons have fair play. Fielding's Harriot, a lovely natural charafter of a young girl in the Autbour's Farce, fays to her lover
“ And thy arms my coach and fix.”
A fine figure to exprefs enthufiaftick fondnefs.

DRURY-LANE.
ON Saturday evening, Feb. 17th, was performed, for the firft time, a new tragedy called The Royal Suppliants. The charafters were thus repre-fented:
Acamas
Demophoon
Alcander

Mr. Bannifter, jun.
Deianira	Mrs. Crawford.
Macaria	Mifs Farren.
The plot is partly hiftorical, and partly fabulous.	*
The firlt aft informs us that Deianira, the widow of Hercules, and her two children, Hyllus and Macaria, are driven from Argos by the tyrant Eu-ryftheus, who had ufurped the throne. After having vainly follicited the pro-teftion of different dates, the queen and her daughter take refuge in a temple at Athens. To which place they are followed by Alcander, rhe herald of Euryilheus, who comes to demand them of Demophoon, King of Athens. The king being at that time abfent, Acamas, his brother, is invelled with the royal power;who is fo much affected by the beauty and diitrefs of Macaria,
that he promifes to become her protector againft Euryilheus. Upon which, Alcander declares war againft Athens, and tells the prince, that Euryilheus is now on his march againft him.
In the fecond aft, Demophoon returns to Athens; and Alcander, who had previouily bribed Theftor, a pried of Jupiter, to pronounce a falfe oracle, which required the facrifice of Dei'ani-ra or Macaria, before Hyllus could be reftored to the throne of Argos, endeavours to make Demophoon jealous of his brother ; and partly prevails upon him to favour the demand of Eu-rydheus. Upon hearing the oracle, Macaria offers herfelf a viftim to fave her mother, and reftore her brother Hyllus to the throne. Demophoon is druck with her noble behaviour, and feems unwilling to give his confent, without further deliberation.
Acamas, in the third aft, acknowledges to Deianira his love for Macaria, and acquaints her with the arrival of Hyllus, who is to appear as his fol-dier. Hyllus then enters to acquaint Acamas, that Euryllheus is on his march to Athens. A tender interview follows between him and his mother. They both retire, at Demoplicon’s approach ; who reproaches Acanus for bringing him into fuch danger. Alcander and Thedcr prevail upon the

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
ON Saturday evening Mifs Phillips appeared in the part of ClariiTa, in the School for Fathers, for her own benefit; which was attended by a very brilliant audience.
The choice of this chara&er was more happy than that of Mandane; the fitaations of delicate embarrafl'ment, in which Ciariifa is involved, received a natural colouring from the aporehenfive timidity which Mifs Phillips fiill feels very ltrongly, and which had an interell-iog and epgaging etteit. Her voice, which is a high counter-tenor, is heard to more advantage in the comic than the ferious opera ; the tone i« more natural, and has lefs of that infirumental found, which is the effect of labour, in a talk that is yet too arduous for her mulical experience. Her whole performance greatly raifed the expeftations conceived from her firft appearance, as ihe pofieffes finking talents, which are evidently capable of great i mprovement, with a very elegant perlan, though Ihe has ftiil much to attain in ftage deportment, and in thofe arts of- reprefentation which experience only can give. •
Mrs. Mahon, at Covent Garden Theatre, appeared in the charafter of Lady Townly, for hpr own benefit. This, we underfiand, clofes the Lady’s theatrical career, which, though fhort, has been moft brilliant, and her fate bears i pretty firong- refemblance to that of Phaeton, both in the boldnefs of the attempt, and in its hidden wnninayan, -A/Jc 13 iJ*P/

SUCH is the amazing difference, in point of effeic, between the reprefentation of Hamlet, as written by Shakefpear, and as altered by Garrick, that one would wonder how the fame town that had tailed of the one, could poflibly put up with the other. Shakefpear’s H.tmlec is a noble, warm, and wonderful effort of genius; Garrick’s alteration funk Denmark’s Prince into a dull, frigid, artificial Petit Maitrt ; Sh?kefpear made Hamlet a magnificent inllrument ol “ God’s revenge againft murder,” Garrick convened, or rather perverted the Prince into a butcher, and fent him into aTlaugnt.r houle to fix his knile in the throats of all around him Tuefday r.ight Shakefpeur’s Hamlet was well ailed at Drury I^ane Theatre. Mr. S nith has fo often b-.en feen in the principal character", thar it is needlefs to fay more than that he played it with more than zasrnron animation and energy. Baddeley was charafteriliically happy in Polonm;, Aickin warm arid fpirited in Laertes, Parfons humouroufly natural in the Gravedipger, and Mifs Field as fuccefsful in Ophelia, as could reafonablv be exoeiled.

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
.	3 f 'Drury Lane.
T'HE HYPOCRITE was pe formej on Thuric]ay night to a moil crouded and brilliant audience. It was (lire net the mer.t of the piece, but the powerful name of Mrs. Aldington that drew the people together. The play was written by Cibber, for the purpofe of cor-refting the vices of a party that is now no more. It has therefore more of politics than of comedy, like a’l plays that are founded on local, tempo rary fubjefb, the manners are obl lete, and the audience require the aid of hiftorical knowledge to give them a jult pofleffion of the ftory. Mrs. Abington in Charlotte was admirable; (he gave an eile and elega' ce to the coquetry of the part finer than the author,who with alt his fondnefs for coquetry, was able to infufe. Mr. Moody’s Cantwell was tamely chaite, with the ufual allowance for di&lcft. He exprelles the ideas of his author corrcdly and pointedly, with as little trouble to himfelf, as any performer on the llage. Whatever emo.ions he may infpire iu others, he is calm ia himfelf. The other parts in this piece aiTord no opportunity to an aftor. They are all fomewiiat in Mr. Moody’s way—fu.otuh and gentle. We obferved in Mr. Iljlcroft’s per-.ormance cf Maw-worm, traces of original humour, afiociaicd with features and deportment well calculated for tnat particular lice of playing, and which will not fail to rtcommrr.d him to the town, if he cultivates and confine» himfeif to that defer.ption of par s.

MR. Cumberland's Comedy of the Weft Indian was laft nigat pertormsd with uncommon fpirit at this ti.e-itre. The principaltharaflersi.xthis piece are Hill in the pcffeffion of thofe performers who full rrjrefented rhetn when Mr. Cumberland brought this Comedy on the ftage. Their feveral merits are fj well k .own and fo univerf-JIy acknowledged, that it is &lmult Unr.ecclTary to ob»-ferve, that no author who has ever written for the theatre ftands more jndebtid :e a D ram ait's JPer-finer, than Mr. L'umnerHrd. That delerved favourite of the public,. Mr, ,K ng, continue* to give a bril iatu coloarifg to the fyfightly part of B-lcour.' Mr- Moody’» Major- G'Flaharty- is beyond all doubt a perfeil piece of ailing. N.pe thing is over done, nor could we difcover a lingie look, attitude, or circumllaricc lift undone, throughout the whole, that was neceftary to a correii reprefentabon of the character. Mr. Bre-reton has kindly affilbd the author, and Hiade-the trifling part of Charles Dudley an interefting charatter—BaJdeJey is every thing the aa hof could with in FuliJirr; and as to vhdt inimitable comedian Parlons, he performed the ihort part of Variant! with ail that pleafantry and humour fo peculiar to htmfelfr M,ls Farren appeared /or the fi ll time this feafon, ia the part of Charlotte Rufport, arid it is with great pleaftire we obterv-ed, perfectly recovered from her late indifbofi-ttun. This lovely girl was received with a'! that warmth of applaufe fo juftlv doe to her beauty and accomp-ilh neats ; and Mr». Brcreton, wiioju we confide*- as a very riling y ung aifrcls, gave ithe audience a very feniible faiisfsition inches performance of the amiable Louifa.
Gn Saturday evening, JometUing previous to the opening of Drury lane Theatre, the upper gallciy ¡lair-cafe being nearly filled with people, and two tailors arriving iu the rtn, one of theta being impatient, fwore he would not wait ; when inftaritly mounting on the rail, and running er-peduioufly up that perilous track to what he called the main maft bead, lat th n acrois the rail on the top, calling out to his compan on to c »me alter him into his wake, but who beirg iefs t ol-hardy, cbfolutely refufed ; on which the maft ahfi ran down again the fame way to the ;onom with the utmoft lafeiy, though ¡o the great terror and amazement of the fp.flators, as it» cafe <»f o:ie falfe lie;» he mull inevitably have been killed by falling to the bottom of what is called the flair-cafe well.

Scene—The Palace ofthe Sultans of Per-fia and Places adjacent.
THE drama commences with a conference between two afpiring Courtiers, C3led an Officer, and Ali a Pi tell, by whom we are informed, that Solyman, the Jaft Sovereign of Perfia, had, on his deathbed, bequeathed the Crown to his two ions, Almoran and Hamet, as joint heirs and affociates in the empire.; which had •been done by advice of Omar the Prune Miniller, who retains the feals of efface under the new Moaarchs, the objeit of Alt's ambition. Caled wilhing likewife to fupplant Oimyn, the favourite of Al-moran, the charafters ofthe two Kings are ¡developed as extremely oppefite. Almoran, beirg-naughty, paffionate, and impatient of coii'.roul, is inc nled at the partition cf the Throne. Hamet, on the contrary, is irpteiemed to be of an amiable and peace-
ful difpofition, and intirely fatisfied with his father’s will. Oh this difference in the tempers of the brothers, the two ambitious Courtiers found their hopes and lay the» plots for advancing themfelves; and the fu ll feene clofeswith a defign to excite Almoran to depofe his brother, and to fupplant him in the affections of Almeida the Fair Circadian, the daughter of Abdallah.
In the next feene, Almeida appears attended by Crifanthe, to whom (he relates her inviolate attachmentto Hamet, who had reicued her and her father from the devouring flames when the Palace was on fire. Hamet enters to them, and after reciprocal acknowledgments of their love for each other, he expreffes to Almeida his fears that his brother, inflamed by her beauty, will oppofe their intended union $ upon which (he vows eternal fidelity, and reproves him for his jealoufy. The Prince, feeing his brother approach, retires with Almeida, charging her to avoid being feen by Almoran. But, notwithstanding this precaution, as Almoran enters with Caled, he beholds Almeida as Ihe is eroding the garden to her apartments, after Hamet had quitted her. Love and ambition now prepare Almoran for Chled’s horrid propofal —that he (hould become foie mafter of the F.alf by murdering his brother, after which Almeida would be an eafy conquelt.
Act II. Opens with a icens between
FOR DECEMBER, 1781.	333
Hanaet and Omar, in which the former unfolds his intention to marry Almeida the next day ; Omar, though he approves this union, is ftruck with the fudden appointment of the nuptials, and, forefeeing trouble to the State, requefts a delay, to prepare Almoran for fuch an unexpected event. At the fame time he delivers an admirable admonition to Hamet, to prefer the public welfare and tranquillity to tfomellic joys and private in-terells. Hamet then gives him a letter for Almoran, in which he informs him, in the molt affectionate terms, of his approaching nuptials. Omar receives it with re-lufiance; and in the next feene prefents it to Almoran, who, after reading it, tears it in the utmoft rage, accufes Omar of trealon, and at length, by his reproaches, railes the indignation of the good old Minifter to fuch a pitch, that he retaliates upon the Monarch, teaches him his duty, and humbles his pride j but, his rage returning, he orders Omar to withdraw. Caled now enters j and Al-moran, having refolved to aft the hypocrite, fends Caled to command the attendance of Ali immediately in his private apartment.
Act III. Omar enters, and, obferv-fcg a profound calm to reign throughout the Palace, exprelfes his fears of fame latent enterprize ; and, upon being joined by Hamet, he communicates his apprehenfion to him i and, availing himfelf of his viitu-ous difpofition, after relating what had paf-frd between him and Almoran, he ftrongly urges him, in order to preferve the peace of the empire, to decline the nuptials. Hamel declares himfelf ready to relign the Throne, and all the pomp of State, but will not alter his refolution of efpoufing Almeida. At this crifis Ahnoran enters with an altered countenance, embraces his brother, apologizes for his late rudentfs to Omar, and confimts to give Almeida with bis own hand to Hamet.
The next feene reprefents the infide of a Temple, with every preparation for fo-lemnizing the rites. Almoran orders. Ali, the officiating Pried, to proceed, when he informs him that he waits till his brethren, in their confecrated cave, had finiihed their part of the folemnity, by con-fulting the will of the Gods. In the mean time a lolemn ode is fung i^itb the cho-ruffes, which ended, Almoran prelents Almeida to Hamet ; and, as Ali is about ?io:n their hands, another Pried enters with a Tcroll in his band, Hops the .rites, declares them to be prophanc, and
delivers the fcroll to Ali,- who reads—
‘ The Gods have decreed Almeida to Almoran.’ Almeida is the firft who warmly protefts againft the impious fraud. Omar feconds her; and tells Ali he had long obferved his ambitious views, taxing him likewife with bribery ; but Almoran, unmoved, declares his refolution to aflert his divine right to Almeida. Hamet, driven to defperation, bids defiance to his brother, tells him the fword (hall decide their difpute, and leaves Almeida to the caFe of Omar, who retires with her.
In the following feene Almoran and Alt are difeovered, when the Sultan upbraids the Prielt for his flrallow artifice, and difmifles him in anger, declaring he will trull in future to his qwn judgment. Hamet, now returning, appears to have been circumvented in his defign of making head againft his brother; for he is unarmed, and bitterly exclaims againft Almoran, who, (lung with the reproach of cowardice, gives him a fword, and they engage ir» fingle combat; but the guards difarm and feize Hamet. In this inftant Almeida enters, and interceding for Hamet, Almorati tells her, (he muft confent to obey the will of the Gods ; and, upon her declaration to remain faithful to Hamet, (he is likewiie feized, and both are carried offcaptive.
Act IV. Opens with a conference between Almoran, Qfmyn, and Caled. Almoran now determines to allure Almeida by the pomp and fplendor of the Throne; orders that (he (hould be treated as the Sultana, in ft pa rate apartments of theSeraglio; thatallkmdsofamulement (hould be devifed for her, and th3t Of-myn ffiall guard the Seraglio. To Caled he a (Tigris the charge to watch the motions of Omar, and prevent any unurrectlon of the people in favour of Hamet. He then rewards thefe two Officers by appointing them to be Vicegerents of the empire, while he affumes the ¡over, and tries to conquer Almeida’s attachment to his brother. Almoran and Caled retire. Hamet enters in the habit of a mute, and finding Ofmyn alone, hedifeovers himfelf to him „ ar.d accuies himfelf of being the pander of his mailer’s luft and ambition; Ofmyn Rems to relent, but refufes to open the gates of the Seraglio to Hamet, who thereupon draws a concealed fword and aflails him. Almorar. enters atthis junilure. Hamet ¡urns his fword againft him; but oveicome with fraternal affection, and dreading ihe thoughts of (heddlng hi, brother’s biood, he flings away his iwoid, and becomes a fupplmnt for Almeida’s re-
leafe.

Whowhifpers vows if love and truth.

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
Laft night the Carnival of Venice was performed a fecond time at Drury-lane thestre to a crouded audience, when it appeared to have been pruned throughout' with equal judgment and talle ; various ftriking improvements were inttr-fperfed throughout the reprefen ration ; fnme epigrammatic ilrokes were added, which gave fpirit to the termination of the feeres; and the whole was heard with warm and uninterrupted applaud.
The reception of this piece conveys a very ufeful lefTon both to the public and to authors, as it may teach the audience on fimilar occafiohs not to exoedt '00 much, and the writer rot to fear too little. We wiftt not to be exce'led by any of ourbrethren in real and liberal enenu-age-ment to every writer for the ftage, but we will frankly declare, that we have too high an opinion of Mr. Ticket’s genius acd talents to join in the declaration that the prefent p:ece is any very linking addition Co his reputation. He has evidently taken up the pen with a view to delineate a few light and elegant feenes, fuch as might fuit the flight texture of equivoque, and unite with a brilliant difplay cf mufic, feenery, and fplendid fpe&acle—a defign which Mr. Sheridan had executed before him, and which is extremely well calculated to promote the fab-ilantial purpofes of theatrical exhibitiooL-whilil the public, who had read Anticipation with fur prize and delight, and eilimated Mr. Tickcl ' higher than he had eftimated himfeif, demand- j ed, with a warmth of expettation, which would ill brock difappointment, a regular and highly finished drama. The matter is bow better un-derftood between the parties, and we have no doubt but the Carnival of Venice will become a favourite and popular exhibition. We will farther prophecy, that on a future occafioa the public will attend with more tempered expedition, and will receive from Mr. Tickfei’spen the’higheft •ad moft comolete entertainment.

The prr;ugdion of Mr. Dent, was performed
for the firlt time, and received with a mixture of praife and cenfme. The fa"b!e partly turns or. the well known and finely drawn (lory oF the Ambaffador of Bantam ; and if the author, as he lias plainly made ufeof this idea, improved it to the laugh .o which it might have been carried, the effect mull: have been highly dramatic. Se veral fo tjs are introduced, the bell of which is, the Yellow h.¡¿red Laddie, which Mbfs Philips fung with grecc/alle It is not neceflary to enter into any detail of a plat fo fiender, as that of the farce before us. The charafler of Sir Toby has fome in or.lillency. He is drawn as an Erglifh merchant with great uprigbtnefs, and yet he is civil without Gruericy, and makes pff-.rs of friendfnip without meming. The performers did great juliice to thur feveral chsrafters, pa^ ticularly Mr. Palmer and Mr. Parlons.

On Saturday night the T^rnnsriy of " Venice Prcf.rv’d” peyformeJ for the benefit of the inimitable Mr. S ddonA. The Nlvn igers in giving this Lady hr r benefit thus early in the fe..fon, paid a proper refpeit co her incomparable merits, and deni . trateA their gratitude for the uncommon advantages they have drawn from her talents. The Town were as liberal as tha Managers were jult ; the houfe was full to overflawing ; great part of the Pa was tailed in with the B xesj and all was crosvded with petfons of the firft faftiion and quality in the Kingdom. It mult be plealing to every mind to hear that this Lady, who has a young and molt promising family, has derived a very confiderable fum from her benefit, as the nobility and gentry were emulous in teftifying their refpeft for her powers, by the prefents which they lent her on this occa-fion. It gives us iiapyinefs to fee that there is yet to befound patronage for the Britifh Theatre, and for Britifti performers, at a time when fo mjny of our elevated c^untrymenr with affetted refinement, lavifti praifes, and lquander fortunes on the foppery of the Italian and French Buffoons To enumtrqic the charadlers who diftinguifhed tnemfelves on this occafion would be highly pieafing to us, and we wi!h we could men lion the names with accuracy ; we can only fay, tnerefore, that the Earl of Derby flood at thu head of the lift. This nobleman, untinclured with the love of foreign manners, and above the meannefs of ¡misting even royalty in its foibles, is the avowed patron cf the Britifh Mufe, and adds to the fplendor of his ancient family by the manly ufe w|»!ch he makes of its riches.

Ab3 yet more, her concluding ^cene, were
in tbe’higheft Stile imaginable.
Her iViode of giving the much noted Paf-fage,—much noted in another eminent Adrefs, Mis. Crawford,
M Was he alive ?”
differed fo far, as it was more languid. It dill, however, in our Opinion at leatt, and which Opinion, as it feems to run counter to the general Voice, we therefore advance with proportionate Diffidence—It was, we lay, in our Opinion, yet fo far defedive, as it wanted Embarraffment, and the Shew of Struggle.
On the whole, to pronounce on this Scene, which is the Sol AUiffimns of the Play, and after which the Shadows are very long and abruptly lengthened,—on this magnificent Scene, thus prematurely to be praifed,—to fpeak comparatively,—for the Pleafure of John Bull, who it cannot be denied “ is moll rafcally comparative,”—the Siddons acd the - Crawford thus pafa comparatively in our Efti-mation ;	_
The Siddons,—^onnger and more rich iif-Natural Gilts,—certainly offers much to the' Mind,—and yet much more to the Eye.
Tne Crawford,—without thefe tranfeend- 1 ent Advantages of Form and Coumenance, and ■■■ hich we lament the Want of, to balance this Period with the preceding one,—the Crawford, however, by fome Means or other, offers more to the Heart /——We fpeak as we reel.— — W. app auded, though not fo loud as Sir C. Thompfon, this Scene lalt Night at
Drury Lane.—But we did not weep.-----At
Covent Garden we did weep !
The Drefs of Mrs.Siddons, which is always well chofen and well put on, was far fuperior to the Crawford’s. The Linnen about her Bofom was well ialhiooed in the Likenefs of a Ruff.
The Houle, though not overflowing fall, was very brilliant,—the Women in the Boxes by, far out-numbering the Men. A Difpro-portion this, esfy to be accounted for, from “ the knavifli Piece of Work” in another Theatre, where the Demand for Placet was never known to be fo indecently violent.
Again we fpeak as we feel—with that Scorn and Indignation which, if there was any Spirit in tht; People, fhouid fhew themfelves in Ex-preffions much more ruefully appofite to the unexampled Delinquency of the Times.
The relt of the Drama—Breretan, whom we mean to praife—Jfenfley and Palmer—mud wart for our RelpeiU till another Opportunity.

comes up to to*/n from the Well of England, accompanied by his Lady againft her confent, and his only daughter, in order to c< nfclt two notorious quacks in London, Dr. Seraglio (a Frenchman) and Dr. Humberg (a German), and in contempt of all advice from Lady Meagrim, he writes to thefe Doctors, and a flort time afterwards vifits them accompanied by his daughter, his Lady refufing to be acceffary to his imprudence by going with him. His letter L no fooner brought to Seraglio, than he invites Dr. Humberg to the confultation ; Dr. Seraglio, on account of his confummale ignorance, having engaged Sharper, a young Engli.'hman of good education, but of a ruined fortune, to write bis puffs, defend his charafler, and countenance his impofitions. On receiving the letter from Sir Toby, in which he tells him that he is defirous even at threescore and ten of long life, cn purple to fee his daughter married, who is to inherit his family ellate, and who is to accompany him to the ccafuhation, he hints to Sharper that he may pafs tor a rich patient juft recovered by being under his care, marry Mifs Kitty, and divide tie plunder between them. Sharper accepts the propcfaL dreffes himfelf for the purpofe, and a flumes the charafler of an Iriih Peer, and having thus fettled their preliminaries, agrte that Humberg (hall know nothing of the plot againll Sir Toby’s daughter, which excites a jeakufy in him that prompts him to become a fpy, and which proves in the event the dellruflion of their plan. In the abfence of Sir Toby, Ltdy Meagrim applies to a relation of her family, whofe name is Temple, a thriving young law. per, to come to her afliilance, and dreading the conlequer.ee of the impoiitions that may befall Sir Toby and his daughter, entreats Temple to fall uon fome plan to prevent the tnifehief that is fo threatening to boih. Temple knowing that the houfe of Seraglio is as open 10 intrigue as patients, goes accompanied by Lady Iviea-grim in difguife, and pretending an affair of gallantry, fcefpeak a chamber to retire to after coming from the mafquerade. Seraglio finding them dreffed in the chnraflers of fortune-tellers, after agreeing to accommodate them, begs they will aniufe the company in his houfe by telling their fortunes. This furniffies Temple and Lady Meagrim with an introduifion to the reft of the family, and Sir Toby being taught to underftand from Seraglio, that they are genome Magi from the Eall, come to viiit him from the greatnefs of hia reputation, very eagerly quefti-tms them on his prefent fituation, which produces the plot, and the difeoverv being made, the piece concludes.
The p-fce had many good points, and was infinitely fuperior to the common produflicns cf the benefit feafon : but accuilomed to tr.ifh on thif; occafions, we remark that the audience are more than ordinarily cankered in their ciitrcifms on a benefit play. They Yeem to have adopted the notion that no writer of eminence will cor-■ defernd to employ his talents in this wav ; and what play can have merit, where the author is unknown ? The Quacks were treated with un-jullitiable harfhnefs, and we do not imagine the piece will be renewed.

Whether it is to be imputed to Fear of confronting the patriotic and loyal Precepts ofrThomfon, or whether it was their Poverty alone, we cannat tell; but iome Cauie or other has happened lately, that few of this Gang, (Sam.

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
THE wretchedly impofmg F^rce of the Election—we can mean no other than that #f Weftminfter—has fo kmgfuf-pended our Accounts of more inilrtidlive, though lefs intrufive, Scenes.
Foibrook and Wild, fo far favoured as to have a Monday Night, which we underftand makes a probable Addition to the Receipts of jol. got together great Pit and Galleries.
Mrs. Kemble, very properly, for her efpecial Aid to More Ways than One, had that Piece for her Benefit—Which, again as properly, lhe chofe to aid with Edwin’s Midas.—Edwin cannot be too much applauded as the beft Buffo Singer of the 'Time. If there was a Angle Song in his Stile, extant of Handel’s, of all Men living, Tafca perhaps excepted, Edwin ihould be the Singer of it«—O yes, Ma’am, if there was nothing of that in it—and at the Pantheon only.—As to Mrs. Kemble’s own
Vocality, it does not pretend to much_
What fhe has fhe owes we iuppofe to Harrifon the Singer, who is married to her’ Sifter.
Burton, we underftand, got a little C redit in Lovel—His affumed Clowniflmels was rather neatly finifhed.——The Duke, Sir Harry, Philip and Kitty, all excellently-done at Drury-Lane, makes this a very agreeable Entertainment.—In the Way of the World, our Correfpondent bellows much Praife on the Witwou’d, Sir Wilful Wit-wou’d, Waitwell, and Foible.
On Wednefday Evening that pleafant Pantomime, Harlequin Junior, came alter tliat unpleaiant Pantomime of Shirley’s, the Black Prince, and together brought but an indifferent Ploul'e to the poor People, who were bold enough to take fuch a trafhy Play for their Benefit.
Robin Hood fared better—There was a good Houfe to it, and went off with its ufual Portion of Applailfe and Encore. Baum-garten’s Overture, which was that he wrote for the unfuccefsfal little Piece, Williarti and Nanny, is the more to be liked, the more it b heard. The Movement for the Wind Inftruments is beautifully managed. It is alfo to be commended as a very feientific Competition.

SIR,	it-
BEFORE your Theatrical Intelligencer bores us with “ fomewliat too much” of Mrs. Siddons’s private Feelings, Benevolence and Munificence, he may as well enquire of fome of his Green-Room Friends whether the following Anecdoteof that Lady be not literally true ?
A few Months ago a private Subfcrption was fet on Foot in the Green Room for. the Relief of the much diftrelfed Wide wand Children of Vernon the ftnging Player: M s Wrighten gave Five Guineas, Mils Farren, Seven. When the Plate was handed to Mrs. Siddons, file put into it Half-a-Crown, and when lblicited for a little more, laid lie had Children of her own, and mutt provide for them.
If this Story be as true as it is commonly believed to be from the well known niggardly Uilpofition of the “ adored Truth of the Art,” (to ule yourCorrefpondent’s bombal- » tical Exprcifion) how ridiculous mull his i Panegyric appear, as well as his Hopes ol j Payment by a Miniature Picture !
-------—Unhappy—thy cruel Mailer,
Tke more thou tickleil, gripes his Fill the falter.

OBSERVING in your Paper of Saturday laft a Letter fig ne d « A Dffftr of Players et id genus onsne,” in which an Appeal is made to the Green-Room of Drury-Lane Theatre, relpeiting a private Sub-feription fet on foot tliere feme Time ago for the Relief of the Widow cf the fete Mr. Vernon and his Children, I defife you will -do me die Favour, in Jullice to the Parties concerned, to infert this Letter, conveying a full Contradiction to every Part of thé Anecdote, (as the Author terms it) no fuch Subfcription ever having been fag-gelled or defied;

Mr. Flcenvcod, whofe nf.rae appears among the few ft ttunate adventurers fo properly adduced by Mr. Scott, is the fon of the late patentee, the fame gentleman who fotr.e years played with Mr. Garrick at D-ury-lane. In his fuccefs, which however has been but moderate, there is nothing lo wonder at, confidering with what unufual force of recommendation he went out ; for living in habits of intimacy with Sir Francis Delaval and the Duke cf York. his caufe obtained the patronage of a cer«ain Great Perfonage, who with her own hand wrote in Mr. Fleetwood’s favour to Sir George Cole-brooke—then, by the bye, in fuller_plenitude of power and patronage, than any moTtarch now

Mrs. SLddons nude her firft appearance that rnght in Beividera; and, to the inexpr’ffible ploafure of the audience, anfwered their moil fangaine expectations.—She was received bv thofe loud and univerf3l burfts of applaufe, fo jullly due to her diftinguiihed merit. So great was the d'-mmd for places on the above night, that the manager (willing to oblige thofe ladies and gentlemen who were deprived ot feeing her allonithing powers in the part of Btlyidera on Saturday night, with enjoying that fatisfaflion) has thought it necef-fafy to repeat that tragedy on Wednefday next.
And, in order to avoid all partiality, ana that the public may be as generally accommodated as poffible, Mr. Jackfon has been advifed, that no places for the next evening (hould be marked for any lady who had places for the firft, till fuch time as allthe ladies who were not accommodated that evening, Hull be provided for.
