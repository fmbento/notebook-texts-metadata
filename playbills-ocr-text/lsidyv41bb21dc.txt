A FEW OF THE VERY NUMEROUS

Opinions of the Public Press on the Grand Concerts of the

MESSIEURS RICHARDSON,
THE INVENTORS ANJ) PROPRIETORS OF

THE BOCK BAND,
&HB amBaal'e.i\.raaa!. wnaa. -mm*

'' The history of thi.s invention is interesting; it shows how much may
be effected by a combination ofingenui t \ , ind ust ry, perseverance, and sk HI
Mr. Richardson, the inventor, was a mason by trade, a native of Crosthwaite, near the town of Keswick, where his wife and part of his family
.still reside. Mr. Richardson was in the daily htibi, of working at the rocks
among the mountains, and in pursuing his avocation';, experience taught
him that every sound might be extracted from the rude materials which
he met with in the course of his labours. Being convinced that even the
fragments of the rocks, uncouth as they seemed, might be collected and so
judiciously arranged, as to form musical instruments of surpassing power
and sweetness, Mr, Richardson was induced to commence those labors
which bid fair to hand his name down to posterity. In the year 1*27, the
inventor of the Rock Instruments was employed in building a house at
Thorntluvaitcy and afterwards at Braithwaite, in the neighbourhood of
Keswick, and he then for the first time, began to collect the stones of
which the Rock Band was intended to he composed. The stones which
he first collected, however, did not answer bis purpose, and thus, at the
very commencement of this undertaking, a large portion of time and labor
was necessarily lost. This would have almost been sufficient to have dispirited an ordinary mind; but it only served to increase Mr. Richardson's
efforts, and to convince him that with industry and perseverance, success
lay within his reach. Having discovered that the stones best calculated
for his nurpose were only to be met wi h amongst the rocks of the mighty
Skiddaw, he began to explore the mountain in search of the musical treasures which it contained. The inventor bore these stones from the mountain
a considerable distance to bis home; he htgl afterwards to reduce many
of them, to shape them, and to try their varied notes, before he could pronounce a favorable opinion on their merits. This was a work of immense
labor and time, and required much determination and industry for its accomplishment, and many a hard day's labor in the mountains, in hammering
and chiselling the rough stones, and in selecting and arranging them, ere
he brought to theirpreseutstate the sweet-toned instruments which cost him
thirteen years of unwearied labor and perseverance, under circumstances
such as few minds, not possessed of uncommon fortitude, could have surmounted. But what can oppose the progress of ingenuity and perseverance
united in the accomplishment of a favourite object ? Mr. Richardson amid
every obstacle, kept steady to his purpose, and in the course of time he produced the rude but surprising instruments which have gratified and won the
admiration of all who have listened to their astonishing powers: and certain
we are that the more they become known, the more generally will they become
admired. T h e softest tones of t h e ' lascivious lute,' the sweetest tones of t h e
piano, the shrillest sounds of the'ear-piercing fife," and the loudest and most
sonorous peals of the organ, can be sent forth with a rapidity which produce? the most ravishing sensations, and fills the mind of the listener and
beholder with astonishment, wonder and delight."—Ct'mbvrfand Parquet.

Court Gazelle.—THE ROCK BAND.—Although the novelty of this wondrous invention may in some degree be diminished, the appreciation of
its intrinsic merit must increase each time the ear takes in the melodious
tones produced from the collection of shapeless fragments of which these
musical instruments are composed. T h e full pealing notes of the organ—
the piercing tones of the fife—the booming drum—the liquid sweetness of
the flageolet—all are heard with the greatest distinctness and brilliancy.
Chromatics, staccatos—every variety of expression wjijeh a performer on
the most perfect instrument is capable of imparting, are given by the
Messrs. Richardson in a style of superior excellence. T h e name, (The
Rock Band) can convey no adequate idea of the fact.—for who. would
imagine that stones instead of dancing, as in the days of Orpheus, should
contain within themselves a mine of" sweet sounds," requiring only the
skilful touch of a musical genius to bring them to perfection; to achieve
this the inventor has persevered in his endeavours thirteen years, and after
much determined industry, has produced a result the most wonderful. T h e
softer tones, clear and distinct, are like a remote echo, while the fuller
sounds, majestic & imposing, m i g h t " stimulate the thunder." Irish, Scotch
and Welsh melodies, the most plaintive and inspiring, difficult concerted
pieces—Polkas, Marches, Sacred Music—all are performed with appropriate tone and musical sentiment. The violin, which by universal dictum
has long been considered the only instrument capable of emitting Bounds
resembling the human voice, must henceforth bear a divided sway—-the
thrilling persuasive tones emanating from the Roek Band certainly entitle
this unique invention to an equal rank. T h e Concerts during the past
week, have been as usual both numerously and fashionably attended by
the e'lite of the West End amongst whom were H.It.H. the Duke of
Cambridge, H.R.H. the Duchess of Gloucester, t h e Duke of Beaufort,
the Duke of Leiuster, the Marquis of Worcester, the Marquis of Ormonde,
the Marquis of Douro, the Earl of Lonsdale, the Earl of Cork, the Eari
of Coventry, Lord Grosvenor. 1 K>rd Ashley, Lord Downes, Lord Chesterfield, Lord Teignmouth, Lord Somerset, Lord Burgos, and the Lord
Bishop of London. T h e sensation produced on hearing for the first
time the exquisite melody, may be aptly described in Moore's beautiful
lines:—
" AH stood mute and wondi r ' A ,
Of *l»frafil, the angel turn-;
And tamed and looked mtn the air,
Si. u ondroualy on every sonl.
As if they thought to see the win•
That new enchanted measure stole."
* The angel of melody.
POPE, in his " Ode to St. Cecilia's Day," has a passage moat aptly describing their exquisite:
sonna-iees:
Exulting in triumph, now swell the bold notes ;
Hark I the numbers soft and clear,
In broken air trembling the wild music floats.
Gently steal upon the ear;
Till by degrees remote and small,
Now louder and yet louder rise.
The strains decay
And 111 with spreading sounds the skies.
And melt away,
In a djing, dying fall.

Times,—The ROCK BAND certainly produces tones of the richest harmony, full of sweetness and of the most delicate modulation, and is highly
deserving of pubic patronage. Mr. Richardson, the inventor, has appealed
to the opinion of several eminent musical men, and they have all expressed their delight.
Sir George Smart and Signor Costa, very competent
judges in such a case, have declared their high satisfaction with the result
of his extraordinary invention.
Herald.—THE
ROCE BAND.—Tf we have smiled over the wondrous mythology fable, which represented all nature animate and inani-

mate—tress, rocks, and stones, as well as man, under the magic influence
of Music, how shall we describe the feeling which came over us when
that which had so long been purely ideal, or allegorical, became perceptible to our faculties; when we heard sounds as harmonious as dulcet,
and as sweet as ever touched the heart, ringing from " keys," (if indeed,
we may so term them) composed, framed, and constructed, not upon any
such mathematical principles as we, in our simplicty. conceived to be indispensable to the attainment of musical perfection, but of the rough and
unhewn fragments of rock laid out without much precision, & still less uniform, upon"rudely-shaped frameworks of wood! And y et, paradoxical
as it may appear in print, such are literally ami absolutely the materials
from which we have heard more purely melodious sound* produced titan
we have ever yet known the piano to produce under the most skilful hands,
guided by the most scientific minds. T h e charm of melody does not consist exclusively in a vigorous adherence to the rules of Art. Nature asserts
her right to participate in the triumph; and we now feel how indisputable
is that claim, whether to be put forth in the warbling of the lark that " a t
heaven's gate sings," or in the harmonious sounds struck out of the rudest
and the roughest particles of the rock. A more astonishing or a more
delightful 'concord of sweet sounds,'has never yet been listened to than t h e
Messrs. Richardson.' execution of many of the finest musical compositions.

BANU CONCEKTS.—We confess to have passed a most delightful evening
on Thursday last at the Royal Hotel, Plymouth, where the Messrs.
Richardson developed the extraordinary qualities of their collection of
the fragments of the " mighty Skiddaw."
For the information of our
readers, to whom the " R o c k Band" is unknown, we may just state that
some years since Mr. Richardson aecidently discovered that certain
stones in the neighbourhood of Keswick, produced tones of great beauty
and power. T o apply this discovery, he toiled for years in the adjustment of fragments from Skiddaw, and the result of his labours is the
construction of instruments, for so they may be called, which have a compass of 7 or 8 octaves, and from these uncouth blocks of stone is produced
the most exqusite music that we have ever heard. These mass-,, of
stone whichvary in length from five feet t o six inches, are a m aged in
two rows after the manner of the key board of an organ, and produce a
variety of sounds, which seem to us to bear much resembla.-ee to t h e tones
of the harp, violoncello, and bass
At times we thought we were
listening to some huge_musical snuff box, so rapid was the touch of the
players, and sustained the effect. I t were vain, however, to endeavour
to define the exact quality of the tones which are produced. T o give
some idea of the artistic skill that is displayed by the Messrs. Richardson,
we may add, that the overtures of " Tancredi," " Guillaume Tell," and
" II Barbiere" were played with the most perfect precision as to time
and effect, which could be given them by the most finished orchestra.
Selections from operas and the lighter trifles of Jullien were given with
the same degree of excellence.; and to supply variety to the concert,
some exquisite melodies of Handel. Avison, and Bellini, were produced
on an arrangement of delicately constructed bars of steel. I t has never
been*our good fortune to listen to any thing more delicious than the
Messrs. Richardsons' playing the " Harmonious Blacksmith" of Handel.
Whilst listening to the scarce earthly tones, we could not help thinking
that Venus herself would have left the court of Jove and surrendered at

•Jfecretion, could her blacksmith have played his part so harmoniously.
I t Is a pleasure to be able to confirm the flattering reports which have
Teached us of the ingenuity, perseverance, and good musical taste of the
Messrs. Richardson.

Journal.—RICH

AIWSONS' ROCK AND C H I N E S E STEEI, B A N D . —

W e had the pleasure on Thursday last, of hearing the performances of
t h e celebrated Richardson*, on the stones of the "mighty Skiddaw,"
both morning and evening every one was surprised and gratified at the
exquisite music which these talented performers were enabled to produce
from the dull, opaque, hard schistose, and marly iron-stone of the northern mountain. T h e grandest harmony is produced; so that the performers are enabled to give you the wild rattling combinations of Jullien,
including his Cricket on the Hearth and his British Navy Quadrilles,
the magnificent works of'Handel, or the lighter, softer notes of the Italian airs, or the British ballad. T h e air " We have liv'd and lov'd together," is as sentimental as any young maiden, just awaking to the thoughts
of love, can hear; and that was played exquisitely. T h e notes were produced with feeling,, hnd they died away into the depth and mystery of
quietness, leaving the audience wrapped in silence till they awoke to the
realities of an encore: which was repeated on both occasions. T h e sound
of the steel instruments is very full and sonorous. W e were very much
gratified with Haydn's " God preserve the Emperor," where there was
a union of the two. In that case the treble and tenor played on the steel
and the bass on the rock, the latter producing notes so nearly like those
of the bass viol, that we think we could have defied a blind-folded person
to have told the difference.
Hampshire Advertiser.—The
Rock Band.—It is impossible to convey
in words, anything like an idea of the beauty, the richness, the delicacy and
the fulness of power which characterize the Messrs. Richardsons' performances, in softness of expression they may be compared to the highest cultivated human voice, and in thrilling splendour of effect, they rival the orchestra with all its accessories. When we consider the great difficulty of an instrument, over which they have attained such extraordinary power, we must
pronounce their entertainments not only unique but wonderful,
Norwich Mercury.—No person who has not heard the ROCK BAND can
conceive the perfect emphasis, and what may be termed the light and shade
of their performances. T h e sonorous roundness of the lower notes, the
exquisite sweetness of the middle tones, and the sparkling brilliancy of the
upper treble notes, combined with the perfect command of the pianos
and fortes, produce an almost magical effect. The Rock Band possesses
those grand essentials—purity, richness, delicacy, sweetness, brilliancy,
and sufficient power. T o convey to our readers any adequate idea of the
effect produced by these instruments would be impossible: they are capable of every kind of expression, We were glad to see that the audience
highly appreciated the performances, and the repeated bursts of enthusiastic applause which attended the close of each performance manifested the
appreciation in which the abilities of the gifted artists were held by the
assembly.
T h e airs " We have liv'd and lov'd together," the " Palace
March," and the " G r e e n Hills of Tyrol,' were played with a fine feeling
that went at once to the heart, and loud and unanimous encores greeted
the performers. We believe that no concert was more universally enjoyed.
Messrs. Richardson, give another, and those who love sweet sounds and
will accept our advice and be present, will, we are assured, be enticed, beyond their power of resistance, to repeat their visit.

IN THE KINGDOM,

IN THE TOWN-HALL, RUGELEY,
On Friday, September 30th, and Monday October 3rd, 1842.

HOI. FRANKLIN
Respectfully acknowledges the liberal support, and kind reception he received in Rugeley, in 1832, and has the
honour of announcing that ho has constructed an ENTIRELY NEW APPARATUS, and indulges the sanguine
hope, that, from his additional experience, the Lectures he proposes to deliver, and the extensive nature oi his
Scenery and Machinery, will be found to merit the continued support and approbation of an enlightened Public.
In the Lectures will be demonstrated the coincidence of Astronomical Science with the Sacred Scriptures, and
the fallacy of those arguments exposed, which ignorance and infidelity have so daringly advanced in question of
their authenticity; that Divine Revelation, instead of being opposed to philosophical inquiries, has, in some
instances, anticipated modern discoveries, so that the study of Astronomy is calculated to confirm, rather than
otherwise, the belief of man in Divine Revelation.

Lecture 1.
INTRODUCTION.—Some remarks on \stronomy as a Science. Astr momical knowledge calculated to give
man a conception of the powers of his own mind. The apparent errors of vision pointed out, shewing that the works
of nature are more extensive and magnificent than we can possibly conceive. The EARTH proved to be a spherical body.
SCENE I.—The figure of the EARTH and its Atmosphere represented by a Globe twenty-one feet in circumference, by which it will be proved that the Earth is trnlv upwards from its centre to every part of its circumference. GRAVITATION and ATTRACTION, WIN US, TIDES. CURRENTS, &e.
SCENE II.—Erroneous systems of Tvcho Brahe, and Ptolemy. Proportional size, distance, and telescopic
appearances of the Sun, Moon, Earth and Planets ; Nebulous Phenomena. Clusters of Stars, Binary Systems,
Spots on the Sun, and two extensive view* of the Galaxy, as seen with high magnifying telescopes.
SCENE IIL—A scene founded on the supposition of a PLURALITY of WORLDS, exhibition every Star
as a Sun surrounded by a System of Planets. " Tlte IForlds were framed by the Word of God." Probable construction of the Universe. The Sun proved to bean opaque body surrounded by an illuminated atmosphere.
SCENE IV.—On a grand TELLURIAN will be seen the Earth passing by the signs of the Zodiac, demonstrating in its annual course the beautiful vicissitudes of the seasons, and performing its diurnal motion, whereby the
longest and shortest days are exhibited in the clearest manner. The parrellelism of the Earth's Axis and inclination to the Ecliptic. The apparent motion of the Heavens proved to be occasioned by the motion of the Earth.
SCENE V.—The GRAND ORRERY:—this Machine moves twelve feet high and presents a beautiful view
of the Planets, accompanied by their respective Satellites, having their marks on their Disc; viz the rings of Saturn,
the belts of Jupiter &c. At one view is exhibited a novel and interesting scene—all the Planets moving in majestic
order, and performing their periodical revolutions round their glorious centre, the Sun. By this apparatus will be
seen the heliocentric and geocentric places of the Planets, which will enable youth to understand Ephemerii.

Lecture 2.
SCENE I,—Will exhibit the Moon in various parts of her orbit, shewing the phases presented to the Earth,
during her revolutions. Telescopic views of the Moon, as seen at the full, quadratures, and every part of her orbit.
Also several interesting sections of the Moon as seen through the most approved instruments.
SCENE II.—A Map of the Moon, twenty-one feet in circumference, as corrected up to the present time after
forty years application, by the most eminent Astronomers; being a faithful delineation as she appeared through a
powerful telescope, displaying numerous Mountains, Volcanoes, and other wonders seen on her disc. The Earth
a Moon to the Moon; and the Moon proved to be surrounded by an Atmosphere, &c,
SCENE 111.—Will present Eclipses of the Sun and Moon, particularly that of the Sun in 1820. The Moon
will be seen passing through the Umbra and Penumbra of the Earth's shadow;—in this part it will be proved that
the darkuess which took place at the Crucifixion was preternatural, and wot occasioned by an Eclipse of the Sun,
The Moon will be seen reflecting her borrowed light upon the Earth: and it will be demonstrated that the Earth
reflects its light upon the Moon, acting as a lesser light to rule her nights, as that does with regard to the Earth.
The changes, librations, latitudes, longitudes, mean and true anomaly, apsides, nodes, &c, of that Satellite, and
when Eclipses of the Sun and Moon take place: by which these Phenomena will be rendered familiar to the
capacities of children Retrograde motion of the Moon's node, &c.
SCENE IV.—The motion, position, orbits, elements, and appearances of comets, in general, but more particularly those of 1680, 1811, 1832, the LATE COMET, and that of 2225, and the possibility of their destroying
the Earth refuted.
SCENE V.—The Earth with a vegsel sailing round it. Partial and total Eclipses of the Sun and Moon. The
great Eclipse of the Sun iu 1830, and the annular Eclipse of 1847. Transit of Veuus, k .
SCENE VI.—To conclude with the GRAN0 ORRERY.
All the Subjects of Mr. F's usual Course of Three Lectures, reiU be introduced; and, in addition to t!w
above-mentioned Scenery, each Lecture mill be illustrated by a variety of Auxiliary Diagrams, and of many othet
intermediate figures, illustrative of Astronomical Science, covering in ths aggregate a surface of

2500 SQUARE F E E T .
Each Lecture to commence at Seven o'Clock, and close at Nine precisely.
Tickets may be had of Mr. Walters, and of Mr. Franklin, at Mr. Nichols's,

ADMISSION,—Reserved Seats, 2s.—Children, Is.—Body of the Room, Is

NOVEL MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT.
THE CELEBRATED

CANPANOLOGIAN BAND
©R, @TAFlF©R©S[H10Ri S I L L

RQWIRS-

Mr. G, S. RICHARDSON, with the other Members of the CAMPANQLOGIAN BAND,
ring with uuwearied perseverance for some years attained to a proficiency in their performances,
which has given such satisfaction to several influential families in the neighbourhood of
RUGELEY, before whom they have had the honor of performing—that at their request, they
beg most respectfully to inform the Public they purpose giving a Miscellaneous

CONCERT
ON THE EVENING OF

FRIDAY, Feb. 25th, 1848,
IN THE

TOWN-HALL, RUCELEY,
MR. 6. 0. SCOTCHER,
FOR WHICH OCCASION THEY HAVE ENGAGED

Who will accompany the Bells on the Piano-Forte.

And in order to diversify the Evening's Entertaintuen

MR. R. S M Y T H ,
Haa also been engaged to aing several popular Songs.

Among the numerous mid varied novelties of the present day, there is none more calculated to excite surprise aj*4 admiration, thi
perfection to which Haud-Bell.Binging has been brought. The Band is eompoaed of nix young men, natives of Staffordshire, who play
Waltzes, Airs, Quadrilles, Polkas, &©., with a rapidity of movement that is truly astonishing.* The Bells are so constructed as to estaMe
the performers to play in a number of keys, the reserve Bells are placed on a tibia in front of them, and each individual plays at one and
the same time two Bella, occasionally changing each for one of those upon the table before him. It is almost impossible, hy «iy description, to convey an adequate idea of the precision and harmony with which each piece is executed, and the performances can only oe
appreciated by those who have heard them; indeed it has been the general remark of ail those Who have had as opportunity of hearing
these performances, that " one could have hardly imagined it possible that such sweet and soft notes could be produced by hand-bells,"
h
- rapidity with which each bell is i hanged, proves that the performers have attained great perfection after long and indefatigable practice.
,y are under the leadership of Mr. G. S. Richardson, and the Piano-Forte accompaniment of Mr. Seotcfier ia « valuable acquisition,
ha Geneertfalikewise varied by the introduction of Songs, Ballads, &c, by Mr. Smyth.

K I N G O F SCOTLAND.

This Tragedy, of all the Plays of Shakespeare, is the most replete with striking incident,
being one of the greatest master-pieces of human nature, exemplifying, in the hero and the
heroine,—the horrors of a too prominent ambition. Macbeth is delineated*, man of perfect
parts possessing an infinity of beautiful thoughts and ere he became the regicide, was free
and happy. Lady Macbeth, the sharer of his throne and crime, may be considered as a
great counterpoise, working against his finer reason, fanning the latent spark of ambition into
a devouring flame. To the admirer of moral sentiment, it affords a magnificent gratification.
None but the Bard of Avon could have thrown the rosy flush of healthful loveliness U.to the
features of a play so thick with horror.

Respectfully beg leave to acquaint the Ladies, Gentlemen, and Inhabitants in general of RUNCORN and its
Vicinity, that they intend opening a neat and commodious Theatre, at Mr. EDWARDS's, on WEDNESDAY,
10th NOVEMBER, 1819. Having engaged the principal part of the Knutsford Company, and the high esteem
which the Managers above mentioned have been held, in Frodsham, Stockport, Tarporley, and most of the
principal towns in Cheshire, make them proudly style themselves Managers of The CHESHIRE COMPANY;
and have the honour to be patronised by the Earl of Darlington, Lord Lowther, and most of the Nobility and
principal Magistrates of Cumberland. Westmoreland, Yorkshire, and Cheshire; and as respectability of character,
more than profit, is their aim, the public may depend on the strictest morality in the selection of their pieces, and
propriety of conduct in the members of their Company. Runcorn is the last town in Cheshire, that the Company
visit, preparatory to their entrance into Lancashire, from which they return in the spring, to visit Frodsham, &c
&c and hope to add to the list of their successes, the applause and approbation of the town of Runcorn, which it
Will ever be their highest pleasure to receive and merit.

On WEDNESDAY, 10th November, 1819,
Will be presented the Grand Tragedy (written by the Rev* C.

MAUTRIN,)

of

Bertram ;
Or, The Castle of St. Aldobrand.
This Piece is allowed to be the best production that has appeared on the English Stage for many years. So wonderful
is its power of attraction, that for upwards of ten weeks it hasfilledthe immense pile of buildings in Drury Lane,
every night of its representation. A piece so universally admired, so rapturously received ia the Metropolis, and
on the merits of which, the public Daily Papers have teemed with the warmest panegyrics, which alone must
continue to recommend it to every provincial Theatre. The story is, that Bertram, the Hero of the piece,
having become an outlaw, on his return is driven to despair by the marriage of Imogine to St. Aldobrand, and the
Scenes between them are of that powerful nature which cannot lail to please, delight, and at the same time electrify
every feeling heart.

A NEW TRAGEDY
Will be presented (fot* the first time here)

On MONDAY Evening, MARCH 31st, 1823,
CALLED THE

APOSTATE;
Or, The Moors in Grenada.
To «ly the pby of the AposTATE has been well received in the Metropolis, would It* Hut a
weak tribute of respect to the Author, or to the discernment of a London audience, where it jbas
been performed Twenty-nine sucessive nights, before crowded houses, and honored with applause,
rapturous, unanimous, and unbounded : it has justly obtained the apj»eJiatiou of one of the best
Tragedies with which the Public have of late been favored.
The play Is founded la the reign of Philip the 2nd. when the Moors revolted in Grenada, unci
(•.•.claimed against the tyrannical cruelty of the Spanish yoke.. The story is extremely interesting,
the plot is well contrived and skilfully inauaged, Many pasaages are highly poetical, SMKI the incidents well calculated to command the attention, and deeply interest the feelings of an audience.
The principal emotions excited by the play are for the aged, uafortunatc, and snffering
Malec,—kw stiU more wretched friend fiyroea -and the innocent, unhappy Florinda ; ami nbhorance of the diabolical and detestable machinations of the cruel, unfeeling, ambitious tyrant Ciscara,

THEATRE*

RUTHIN.

On W E D N E S D A Y Evening, A P R I L 2d, 1823,
Will be Performed, a New Grand MELO-DRAMA, called

THE BROKEN

8WORD;

Or, The Dumb Orphan Protected.

This admirable Piece is founded on facts,and pronounced by the London Critics to be " a grand
treat to all trae lovers of the Drama." The interest commences in the first Scene, and is gradually
wound up till it reaches the highest climax, no incident is delayed, or hurried beyond the precise
moment of effect: no description of the story can equal the effect it has upon an audience.—
Claudio & the villian Rigolio, two Officers, return from the wars loaded with honors, are presented
with Swords alike; on their arrival, Myrtillo, a dumb Orphan is announced, whose father Rigolio
had previously murdered. Rigolio fearing that Myrtillo will recognize him, resolves on his assassittation, to which intent he contrives to meet the Orphan on a Bridge, and throws him over; in the
scuffle he strikes at him with his Sword, and breaks part of it off against a stone, and escapes ;
Esteven, a faithful Galley Slave, who had been condemned to death by Rigolio, escapes, watches
and saves the Boy, also finds the broken part of the Sword, and immediate search is made; Esteven accuses Rigolio of the crime, who instantly draws his Sword and rushes on him, the point is
found to be broken, which discovers his villiany; he is ordered for punishment, and the Piece haptwly concludes with this excellent lesson—
" T H O U SHALT DO NO MURDER."
' For murder though it has no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.' And however it
may for awhile be concealed, it rarely fails to meet condign punishment.

Will be Performed, Shakespear's celebrated Comedy, of

The

^Merchant
VENICE;
CRUEL
JEW9.
OR,

THE

This admirable and wonderful exertion of our immortal Bard, is justly ranked as the first and
most finished Drama that ever graced the English Stage. Whether we are led to contemplate the
savage and dreadful malignity which marks the cruel Shyloek, the strong friendship and manly
resignation of the princely Merchant, the generous deportment of the noble Bassanio, the humorous levities of Gratiano and Nerissa, and the whimsical eccentricities of the quaint Launcelot,
or the sublime affection of the charming Portia, the audience are equally in astonishment and delight, and the subsequent mortification and desire of the blood-thirsty Hebrew, must prove grati-1
fying to every one in whose bosom the divine principle of mercy inhabits, and impress the spectator with the unerring maxim, that " Virtue is its own Reward," and " Vice its own Punishment."

On SATURDAY, the 17th of MAY, 1823,
WILL BE PRESENTED, THE CELEBRATED TRAGEDY, OF

GEORGE
BARNWELL;
Or, The London

.Merchant.

It is recorded, and the fact is sufficiently proved, that a young Gentleman of the city of London, having embezzled part of his Master's property, was providentially at the representation of
George Barnwell, at Drury Lane, when that admired Actor, Mr. Ross, personated George Barnwell, at whose fate he was so struck, that it occasioned his immediate contrition and conversion.
The gentleman so benefitted by this excellent Tragedy, was not ashamed to own his obligations
to the play and performers; for at every subsequent yearly benefit, Mr. Ross received a hundred
pounds sterling, with a card to the following effect:
D E A R S I B , One who is indebted to your admirable representation of George Barnwell for
more than life, for redeemed honor and credit, begs your acceptance of the enclosed, which sum
you will receive yearly so long as you continue in the line of your profession. Happy am I to acknowledge that the stage has preserved me from ruin and disgrace. George Barnwell stopped me
in my mad career, and saved me from an ignominious death,
I am your grateful friend and servant,
A CONVERT.
A celebrated and learned divine observes, that "Fathers and Heads of Families, whose duty it
is to watcfc over and gAle the morals of the rising generations would do weBfto permit those under their cure, to J>e pr«ent at the performance of this excellent Tragedy, in Tvhich instruction is
blended with amusement."

OF THE

ROCK,
Or, The Cruel Husband.

This beautiful, interesting, and celebrated Piece, (founded on facts) is among the variety Iff the Dramatic productions of the Author, one of his happiest efforts. Lord Maclean, head of one of the most powerful of the Highland
Clans, entertaining unjust suspicions of his Wife, which afe increased by the envious insinuations of DagaTd, !u9
younger Brother, who aims at the possession both of her and his estates; causes her to be conveyed to a barren
Rock, near the Promontory of the Mull, but distant from (he main land three or four leagues, and over which the
Sea at high water, beats with so much violence as to render it certain destruction to those who have the misfortune.
to be east upon it; Lord Maclean supposing her to have perished upon the Rock, causes a solemn Meek Funeral
of her supposed Remains, when the Procession (oh its way to the place oflnterment) is intercepted tfj the arrival
of Campbell, who demands to see his Sister, dead or atht, which Lord Maclean objecting to, a dreadful encounter
is about to ensue between the Clans, when Lady Maclean (who had been rescued from her perilous situation by
Sandy the Fisherman, at the hazard of his life) suddenly appears to her astonished Husband and enraged Brother,
the Piece concludes with the reconciliation of the Clans, and the death of Dugald, who by drinking some poisoned.
Wine, which he had prepared for his Brother, becomes the rictiw of his own treachery.

The "Tale of Mystery," is universally allowed to be the most interesting Melo-Drama produced on
the British Stage, both as to situation and effect. The outlines of the story are briefly, that Count
Romaldi barbarously attempts the life of his brother, Francisco Bianchi, to gain possession of his estates.
The assassins hired for that purpose meet Francisco on the mountains, and deprive him ofthe power of
speech. B Y I N H U M A N L Y C U T T I N G O U T H I S T O N G U E IV. In this situation he is
relieved by a domestic of Count Bonamo, to whose house he is conveyed. In the mean time Count
Romaldi projects an union between his son and the neice of Bonamo, and arrives at the residence of the
latter for that purpose. To his astonishment, he meets his brother, whom he supposes dead. He again
attempts his life, but Francisco is miraculously preserved by the heroism of Selina, the neice of Bonamo,
Suspicion being excited, Romaldi is obliged to fly. Information is given to the Officers of Justice, by
Montano, a neighbouring gentleman. Count Romaldi flies, and, amidst the Rocks of Appenez, encounters
hi. brother on the very spot where he formerly attempted the murder! Struck with remorse, he presents
a pistol to Francisco, beseeching him to take his life; but his humane Brother dashes the instrument of
death away, and, throwing himself into Romaldi's arms, grants him his forgiveness!!!

A greater encomium or more powerful recommendation cannot be bestowed to render this interesting Piece acceptable*© the pstmw
of the Drama,than that which we witness in the advertisements of the public papers—the fact of its having been represented 1000 nights.
There is not, perhaps, any passion, circumstance, or situation in life, that comes home to the feelings, or finds such interest in the generous and sensitive breast, as the dissolution of domestic feiidtv, which forms the principal action of this Drama. The piece is founded
on that universally-known aud popular Song,—"ALL IN THE DOWNS THE FLEET WAS MOOR'D." Independent of which
it forms a most interesting fable, abounding with a variety of incidents, which have not failed to excite the laugh of mirth, the tear of
sympathy, and the burst of satisfaction.
*
WILLIAM is united to the celebrated BLACK.-EYED SUSAN—advene circumstances compel him to leave his home, be become* a
brave and esteemed Sailor in the British Navy. During an absence of three years, Susan is distressed by the cruelty of her Uncle, and
a Captain, supposing her situation will compel her to marry him, invents a tale of her husband's death. The presence of William at
the moment, defeats the plot. Susan attracts the notice of William'* Captain, he attacks her while alone—William come, to her relief,

to visit this sublunary world, would be an act of presumption.—He is the foundation stone and dome of literature and morality
—unapproached and unapproachable—the first and the last.—One who has made the name of Englishman respected among
the nations of modern Europe more than our thousand and one victories—a benefactortothe human race, and an honor to the
country that gave him birth. Let no man, whatever may have been his early prospect*, or however high his birth, after
having adopted the profession of an Actor, blushforhis calling from the remains of prejudice against it.—He can call Shakspeare brother, a forerunner in his art; not with the doubtful plea of those cities who kid claim to the birth places of Homer
and Virgil, but unquestioned under the hand writing of the Bard, and other undeniable proofs. A name that as long as one
stone of the world remains upon another, and one man to contemplate the ruins, can never be obliterated—SHARSPBARB !

Will be presented SHAKSPEAREV admired Cotnedv of—THE

MERCHANT
Of Venice.

This Play is one of the sublime productions of the IMMORTAL S H A K S P E A K E , and like every thin- emanating from the
pen of the Bard, sets at immeasurable distance the best efforts of the present, and all former ages. Envy has in Tain attempted
to take from him what Judgment has universally confirmed;—nor will it e ' e r be disputed, that " take him for all in all, we
ne'er shall look upon his like again."
The Roscius of the English Stage IG A M U C K ) , who, whilst living had no competitor, and since whose death none have dared
present themselves—this wonder of his own country and the admiration of the world, was wont to observe, when speaking
of Shakspeare, that " when he wrote this Play, Nature stood astonished at her own work, and Genius shed a tear that her
reign was at an end."
The Character of SHYLOCK has been considered the finest production of human fancy.—In it are combined the most
varied and contradictory passions:—Humility and Pride—predetermined malice, veiled by the show of Generosity—Revenge
called into action by the semblance of Justice—Murder justified on a principle of Law—all the finer feelings of Nature and
Parental affection dissipated and absorbed in the lust of Gold. The united wisdom of ages has not found a panegyric to
apply to this finely drawn Character.

The CHAMPION
of
FREEDOM.

This popular Play is founded on fact, and bears reference to the early part of Scottish History, when that celebrated Patriot,
WILLIAM WALLACE—a man of honorable family, though of small political power—roused the dormant energies of his
Country, and by bis personal bravery and heroic example, instilled a love of Liberty Into the breasts of bisfollowers,and
ted them to glory and victory. Thrice did he rescue his native land from bondage; and at last this noble spirit perished by
the treachery of a friend, in whom he most confided. The barbarous act that sealed his doom still remains, and will remak.
to the latest ages, a stigma on the reign wherein it passed. Helen, the partner of his dangers, the companion of bis wees,
is drawn by the hand of a master. In short, this Play has been, and must continue, a favorite with the British public,—in
a Country where person and property is secure—the Laws equally administered—Freedom, the birthright of all—nay .be
very Slave, the moment he touches our hallowed soil, is FREE!
