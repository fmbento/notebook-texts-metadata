KEAN.
DRURY-LJSF. THEATRE.
The appearance of Vlr. Kevn on the metropolitan stage. unquestionably forms an sera of importance in the history of the mimic art. But that it should lead to the production of a new Play of 'siiake^peare— for nothing less can the Play of last night be called—wa* an event which could scarcely have entered into the contemplation of his warmest ad- . mirers. The Tragedy of Richard the Second has ' certainly been placed peaceably on the shelf foe upwards of a century and a half—not because it was wanting in striking and splendid beauties—not because it Was defective in historical truth, or deficient iu strong and well-drawn character—but because the innumerable beauties it possesses, and which bear so strongly*thc ma.-lrs of the great master’s band, were scattered ami/tigt 41 mass of less valuable materials, and encumbered by the pressure of • large portion of heavy and uniuteresting matter. To sift the chaff from the grain was a labour which promised uo reward tj t'*». labourer, until the original and impressive talents .< Kean held it out in the gratification of a successful representation. The Tragedy, as now first played, offers a new field for criticism and for admiration. The principal alterations from the original play consist in copious curtailments, and the ini troduction of speeches and passages applicable to the action of the play, and possessing beautiesin themselves.' The Duchess of Gloucester and the Duchess of York are entirely omitted, and much is happily and judiciously added to the characters of the Queen and Bolingbroke. The splendour of the dresses and de-j corations exceeds all precedent. We n<Jw come to the most important point, which is the notice of the great feature of this newly-created play—to the cause of its creation—to the indescribable beauties of Mr. Kean’s acting! In no one of the characters which he has hitherto acted has he approached in ex-cellenre to his masterly delineation of the character '
. of King Richard the Second ; in every other he has struck out new beauties, which had escaped the observation or failed in the execution of others ; but in this he ha* beeD thrown entirely on himself—the light cannot be said to be reflected ; it is all his own, and more especially during the three last acts, the flashes are so brilliant and so frequent, that the mind is actually lost in the splendour which surrounds him.
This praise may appear extravagant to ihose who have merely perused the play as it is printed, but it is nothing beyond truth. We shall not attempt to fj enter into minute and particular notice of his most striking passages, they would occupy too much space; it must Suffice to say, that his conception of his author 0 and the execution of that conception, were equally grand ; and that the Tragedy of Richard the Second will be considered as indebted for existence, aud for , future and lasting fame, to the »»♦—.at—/ mients vu.i. s-n, ti.ua a tided another precious leaf to the never-fading wreath which adorns the bust of-our immortal Shakespeare.
Mr. Eiliston, though evidently not yet recovered from his indisposition, exerted himself with considerable effect as the representative of Bolingbroke.—
Mr. Pope gave all possible importance and effect to the part of John of Gaunt; and Mr. Rae, Mr. Pow»:a, and Mr. Holland, as Norfolk, Northumberland. and York, were each highly respectable.
Mrs. Bartley was highly impressive in the Queen, particularly in the last scene, which was as fine a piece of acting as we have ever witnessed ; and Miss Poole sang an introduced air with her usual taste.
To say that Mr. Kean’s reception was entbosi-astic, and that immense applause followed this Tragedy's being announced for Saturday, would be unnecessary after the opinion which we have ex- i pressed.

Drury-Lase.—Last night a new tragedy Was performed at this Theatre, written by Mrs. Wll-mot, a near relation of Mrs. Sheridan’s, and called /bo. The scene is laid in the Saxon times in England. The King of Wessex (Pope), is threatened w ith the formidable hostilities of Ethelbuld, the Monarch of Mercia; but to conciliate the two nations, Ethelfrida, a Mercian Princess, (Mrs. Glover) has arrived at the West Saxon Court, to espouse Prince Egbert, (Kean) of whom.she is enamoured; but who is already privately married to/««, (Mrs. Bartley) the orphan daughter of Sigiswold, who had formerly fallen in the service of the King of Wessex. No threatr can induce Egbert to renounce his wife, by whom lie has a young boy.
Ina is equally resolute in asserting her claims as a wife and mother, even before the King and his council, who threaten her with death ; and who, for her contumacy., and for political reasons, adjudge both her and the child to lose their lives. Baldred, formerly a soldier, but who has taken orders, and become a “ holy Abbot .” and the King’s Chief Counsellor, is himself fond of Ina, and employs the blackest means to destroy Egbert, and force her into a religious house.
He is defeated in attempting the assassination of Egbert, and is himself killed. Ina, by various i **■ contrivances, escapes from custody, gains an au- , dience of the King, and succeeds in reconciling' him Egbert routs the Mercian troops, who . have advanced against Wessex, and returns victo- f| rious. Ethelfrida.meeting Ina in the palace, en- , deavours to stab her, but being prevented, plunges ' the dagger into her own breast. The fortunes of Egbert and Ina are, of course, triumphant, and their marriage acknowledged by the old ; King. As the authorship of a lady, we are strongly indisposed to be severely critical on this production.' The story is well enough told, and it is not of au ¡J unintere.-ting description. The language is neat, and,in some passages elegant. The performers exerted themselves: but Kean’s character is not one which sets oft' his peculiar qualificat.ons as an actor. Though the applause wa . .cry frequent . during the first three acts, there was a long contest at the end. The gfeát majority were evidently in favour of the play, but their opponents made noise enough to prevent Kean from being heard . when he came out to announce its repetición.— , The Prologue arid Epilogue touched on the topic ! of female authorship, and solicited candour for 1 an attempt to write a tragic poem. The former i was spoken by Mr. Powell, the la. ter by Mrs. Bartley.	. ,

Diti'HV L>nv.—A Ballet had been for some time announced a, in preparation, which was on Tuesday produced in due form: the title was rather 'any, and not particularly new—Drive hove out at tne Drx>r, and he'll get in at the Window. We must not break a fly upon the wheel of criticism, and therefore jhall only say a very few words. The story was not considered elaborate enough to please the critics ot th< pit—nor funny enough for the gods—nor fine enough for the gentlemen in the lower boxes, who, to prove, we- suppose, that they have now and then formed their Juste for ballets at the Opera House, pronounced the dancing damned low. Notwithstanding all this, D’Eg-vitie and Miss Smith would have done no discredit to the hoards on which Yestris and his companions exhibit; and the music, selected with great taste, was extremely appropriate and pleasing.
